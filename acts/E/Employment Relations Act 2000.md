    *   (a) to build productive employment relationships through the promotion of good faith in all aspects of the employment environment and of the employment relationship---

        *   (vi) by reducing the need for judicial intervention; and

    *   (b) without limiting paragraph (a), must not, whether directly or indirectly, do anything---

        *   (ii) that is likely to mislead or deceive each other.
        
        
    
    (1A) The duty of good faith in subsection (1)---
        
    *   (a) is wider in scope than the implied mutual obligations of trust and confidence; and
    
    *   (b) requires the parties to an employment relationship to be active and constructive in establishing and maintaining a productive employment relationship in which the parties are, among other things, responsive and communicative; and
    
    *   (c) without limiting paragraph (b), requires an employer who is proposing to make a decision that will, or is likely to, have an adverse effect on the continuation of employment of 1 or more of his or her employees to provide to the employees affected---
            
        *   (i) access to information, relevant to the continuation of the employees' employment, about the decision; and
        
        *   (ii) an opportunity to comment on the information to their employer before the decision is made.
        
        
    
    (1B) Subsection (1A)(c) does not require an employer to provide access to confidential information if there is good reason to maintain the confidentiality of the information.
    
    (1C) For the purpose of subsection (1B), _good reason_ includes---
        
    *   (a) complying with statutory requirements to maintain confidentiality:
    
    *   (b) protecting the privacy of natural persons:
    
    *   (c) protecting the commercial position of an employer from being unreasonably prejudiced.
    
    (2) The employment relationships are those between---

    *   (b) a union and an employer:
    
    *   (c) a union and a member of the union:
    
    *   (d) a union and another union that are parties bargaining for the same collective agreement:

    *   (f) a union and a member of another union where both unions are bargaining for the same collective agreement:
    
    *   (g) a union and a member of another union where both unions are parties to the same collective agreement:
    
    *   (h) an employer and another employer where both employers are bargaining for the same collective agreement.
    
    (3) Subsection (1) does not prevent a party to an employment relationship communicating to another person a statement of fact or of opinion reasonably held about an employer's business or a union's affairs.
    
    (4) The duty of good faith in subsection (1) applies to the following matters:
        
    *   (a) bargaining for a collective agreement or for a variation of a collective agreement, including matters relating to the initiation of the bargaining:
    
    *   (b) any matter arising under or in relation to a collective agreement while the agreement is in force:

    *   (c) consultation (whether or not under a collective agreement) between an employer and its employees, including any union representing the employees, about the employees' collective employment interests, including the effect on employees of changes to the employer's business:
    
    *   (d) a proposal by an employer that might impact on the employer's employees, including a proposal to contract out work otherwise done by the employees or to sell or transfer all or part of the employer's business:
    
    *   (e) making employees redundant:
    
    *   (f) access to a workplace by a representative of a union:

    *   (a) not to be involved in bargaining for a collective agreement; or
    
    *   (b) not to be covered by a collective agreement.

##### 69E Examples of contracting in, contracting out, and subsequent contracting
    
*   (1) This section contains examples of contracting in, contracting out, and subsequent contracting.
    
    (2) Whether, in the following examples, an employee comes within the protection provided by this subpart depends on whether [section 69F][137] applies to the employee.
    
    (3) This subsection sets out examples of contracting in.
    
    ###### Example A
    
    A rest home carries on business in the age-related residential care sector. Instead of providing food catering services through its employees, it enters into an agreement with an independent contractor to provide those services.
    
    The agreement under which the independent contractor provides those services to the rest home expires or is terminated.
    
    The rest home then uses its employees or engages further employees to provide those services.
    
    Employees of the independent contractor to whom section 69F applies may elect to transfer to the rest home.
    
    ###### Example B
    
    The circumstances in this example are the same as in example A except that the independent contractor engages a subcontractor to provide food catering services to the rest home.
    
    As a result of the agreement between the rest home and the independent contractor expiring or being terminated, the agreement between the independent contractor and the subcontractor expires or is terminated.
    
    Employees of the subcontractor to whom section 69F applies may elect to transfer to the rest home.
    
    ###### Note
    
    In both example A and example B, it does not matter whether the rest home's or the independent contractor's employees originally provided the food catering services or whether the work was contracted out or subcontracted at the outset.
    
    In example A and example B, the persons relate to the definition of contracting in as follows:
        
    *   the rest home is person A:
    *   the independent contractor is person B.
    
    (4) This subsection sets out examples of contracting out.
    
    ###### **Example C**
    
    A school has employees who provide cleaning services.
    
    The school then enters into an agreement with an independent contractor to do that work or some of that work.
    
    The employees of the school to whom section 69F applies may elect to transfer to the independent contractor.
    
    ###### Note
    
    Example C would not be a contracting out if, at the outset, the school did not have employees providing cleaning services.
    
    In example C, the persons relate to the definition of contracting out as follows:
        
    *   the school is person A:
    *   the independent contractor is person B.
    
    ###### **Example D**
    
    The circumstances in this example are the same as in example C, except that later on the independent contractor decides that, instead of using its employees for the contract for the school, it will engage a subcontractor to do the work or some of the work.
    
    Employees of the independent contractor to whom section 69F applies may elect to transfer to the subcontractor.
    
    ###### Note
    
    In example D, the persons relate to the definition of contracting out as follows:
        
    *   the independent contractor is person A:
    *   the subcontractor is person B.
    
    ###### Note
    
    In example C and example D if, at the outset, the independent contractor did not have employees providing cleaning services, but subcontracts the work straight away, then the employees to whom section 69F applies may elect to transfer to the subcontractor.
    
    (5) This subsection sets out examples of subsequent contracting.
    
    ###### **Example E**
    
    An airport operator enters into an agreement with an independent contractor to provide food catering services at the airport.
    
    Some time later, the agreement under which the independent contractor provides those services expires or is terminated.
    
    The airport operator then enters into an agreement with a second independent contractor to provide food catering services at the airport.
    
    Employees of the first independent contractor to whom section 69F applies may elect to transfer to the second independent contractor.
    
    ###### Note
    
    In example E, it does not matter whether the agreement between the airport operator and the first independent contractor constitutes a contracting out.
    
    In example E, the persons relate to the definition of subsequent contracting as follows:
        
    *   the airport operator is person A:
    *   the first independent contractor is person B:
    *   the second independent contractor is person C.
    
    ###### **Example F**
    
    The circumstances in this example are the same as in example E, except that the first independent contractor engages a subcontractor to do the work or some of the work.
    
    Later on, the agreement under which the subcontractor provides the work expires or is terminated and the first independent contractor engages a second subcontractor to provide food catering services at the airport.
    
    The employees of the first subcontractor to whom section 69F applies may elect to transfer to the second subcontractor.
    
    ###### Note
    
    In example F, the subsequent contracting occurs at the subcontracting level.
    
    In example F, the persons relate to the definition of subsequent contracting as follows:
        
    *   the independent contractor is person A:
    *   the first subcontractor is person B:
    *   the second subcontractor is person C.

    (2) To avoid doubt, this subpart applies even though the performance of the work by or on behalf of the other person does not begin immediately after an employee ceases to perform the work for his or her employer.
    
    Section 69F: substituted, on 14 September 2006, by [section 6][510] of the Employment Relations Amendment Act 2006 (2006 No 41).

    *   (a) a reasonable opportunity to exercise the right to make an election under [section 69I(1)][140]; and
    
    *   (b) the date by which the right to make an election must be exercised; and
    
    *   (c) information sufficient for the employees to make an informed decision about whether to exercise the right to make an election.

    *   (d) how to make an election, the person to whom an election is to be sent, and the form in which the election is to be sent (for example by post, fax, or email).
    
    (3) If the restructuring is a contracting in or a subsequent contracting, person A in the definition that applies must give the employer sufficient notice of, and information about, the restructuring to enable the employer to comply with subsection (1).
    
    (4) An employer or other person who fails to comply with this section is liable to a penalty imposed by the Authority.
    
    Section 69G: substituted, on 14 September 2006, by [section 6][510] of the Employment Relations Amendment Act 2006 (2006 No 41).

##### 69H Employee bargaining for alternative arrangements
    
*   (1) To avoid doubt, an employee may, after his or her employer has complied with [section 69G][138] and before deciding whether to elect to transfer to the new employer, bargain with his or her employer for alternative arrangements.
    
    (2) If the employee and employer agree on alternative arrangements,---
        
    *   (a) the alternative arrangements must be recorded in writing; and
    
    *   (b) if paragraph (a) is complied with, the employee may not subsequently elect to transfer to the new employer.
    
    Section 69H: substituted, on 14 September 2006, by [section 6][510] of the Employment Relations Amendment Act 2006 (2006 No 41).

    (2) If an employee elects to transfer to the new employer, then to the extent that the employee's work is to be performed by the new employer, the employee---
        
    *   (a) becomes an employee of the new employer on and from the specified date; and
    
    *   (b) is employed on the same terms and conditions by the new employer as applied to the employee immediately before the specified date, including terms and conditions relating to whether the employee is employed full-time or part-time; and
    
    *   (c) is not entitled to any redundancy entitlements under those terms and conditions of employment from his or her previous employer because of the transfer.
    
    (3) To avoid doubt,---
        
    *   (a) the election of an employee to transfer to a new employer may result in the employee being employed by more than 1 employer if---
            
        *   (i) only part of the employee's work is affected by the restructuring; or
        
        *   (ii) the work performed by the employee will be performed by or on behalf of more than 1 new employer; and

    ###### **Example**
    
    This example relates to subsection (3)(a). A retailer owns 3 gift shops and engages an independent contractor to clean the shops. The independent contractor employs a cleaner to clean the gift shops.
    
    The cleaning contract between the retailer and the independent contractor expires.
    
    The retailer enters into a cleaning contract with a second independent contractor for the cleaning of 1 shop, and enters into a new cleaning contract with the first independent contractor for the cleaning of the other 2 shops.
    
    As a result, the first independent contractor no longer requires the cleaner to clean 1 of the shops.
    
    The cleaner may elect to transfer and become an employee of the second independent contractor in relation to 1 shop while remaining an employee of the first independent contractor in relation to the other 2 shops.

Personal grievances, disputes, and enforcement

#### Object

##### 101 Object of this Part
    
*   The object of this Part is---
        
    *   (a) to recognise that, in resolving employment relationship problems, access to both information and mediation services is more important than adherence to rigid formal procedures; and

    *   (b) to continue to give special attention to personal grievances, and to facilitate the raising of personal grievances with employers; and
    
    *   (c) \[Repealed\]
    
    *   (d) to ensure that the role of the Authority and the court in resolving employment relationship problems is to determine the rights and obligations of the parties rather than to fix terms and conditions of employment.

Institutions

    *   (a) support successful employment relationships and the good faith obligations that underpin them; and
    
    *   (b) recognise that employment relationships are more likely to be successful if problems in those relationships are resolved promptly by the parties themselves; and

    *   (d) recognise that the procedures for problem-solving need to be flexible; and
    
    *   (da) recognise that the person who provides mediation services can manage any mediation process actively; and
    
    *   (e) recognise that there will always be some cases that require judicial intervention; and
    
    *   (f) recognise that judicial intervention at the lowest level needs to be that of a specialist decision-making body that is not inhibited by strict procedural requirements; and
    
    *   (fa) ensure that investigations by the specialist decision-making body are, generally, concluded before any higher court exercises its jurisdiction in relation to the investigations; and

        *   (i) will not contribute constructively to resolving the matter; or
        
        *   (ii) will not, in all the circumstances, be in the public interest; or
        
        *   (iii) will undermine the urgent or interim nature of the proceedings; or

*   Schedule 1C: inserted, on 1 October 2008, by [section 122][719] of the Policing Act 2008 (2008 No 72).

##### 1 Application
    
*   (1) This code applies to the following parties:
        
    *   (a) the New Zealand Police (the _Police_):
    
    *   (b) Police employees:
    
    *   (c) service organisations:
    
    *   (d) other employers to the extent that they provide services to the Police:
    
    *   (e) employees of the employers referred to in paragraph (d) to the extent that they are engaged in providing services to the Police:
    
    *   (f) unions whose members are employees referred to in paragraph (e) (_other unions_).
    
    (2) However, to avoid doubt, subclause (1)(d) and (e) applies in relation to the provision of services only if the services are provided to the Police in its role as a provider of Police emergency response services.
    
    (3) Before the Police enters into an agreement or arrangement with another employer for the provision of services to the Police, it must notify the employer that this code will apply to the employer in relation to the provision of those services.
    
    (4) However, failure to comply with subclause (3) does not affect the validity of an agreement or arrangement referred to in that subclause.

##### 2 Purpose
    
*   The purpose of this code is---
        
    *   (a) to promote productive employment relationships in relation to the provision of services by the Police:
    
    *   (b) to require the parties to make or continue a commitment---
            
        *   (i) to the safety of the public and Police employees; and
        
        *   (ii) to develop, maintain, and provide high quality policing services; and
        
        *   (iii) to engage constructively and participate fully and effectively in all aspects of their employment relationships:
        
        
    
    *   (c) to recognise the importance of---
            
        *   (i) collective arrangements; and
        
        *   (ii) the role of service organisations and other unions.
        
        
    
    

##### 3 Interpretation
    
*   In this schedule, unless the context otherwise requires,---
    
    _industrial action_ means a strike by, or a lockout of, Police employees
    
    _Police emergency response services_ means services provided by the Police that directly or indirectly enable maintenance of the Police's effective response to calls for service where---
        
    *   (a) people are injured or in danger; or
    
    *   (b) there is a serious, immediate, or imminent risk to life or property; or
    
    *   (c) a crime is being or has just been committed and the offenders are still at the scene or have just left
    
    _service organisation_ has the same meaning as in [section 55][540] of the Policing Act 2008\.
