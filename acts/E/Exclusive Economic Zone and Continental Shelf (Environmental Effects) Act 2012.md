    (4) No person may question a party or witness unless the EPA gives permission.

##### 54 Persons who may be heard at hearings

    (2) However, the Environmental Protection Authority may, if it considers that there is likely to be excessive repetition, limit the circumstances in which parties having the same interest in a matter may speak or call evidence in support.
    
    (3) The Environmental Protection Authority may proceed with a hearing even if the applicant or a submitter who stated that he or she wished to be heard fails to appear at the hearing if the EPA considers it fair and reasonable to do so.

#### Decisions

##### 59 Environmental Protection Authority's consideration of application
    
*   (1) This section and [sections 60][94] and [61][95] apply when the Environmental Protection Authority is considering an application for a marine consent and submissions on the application.
    
    (2) The EPA must take into account---
        
    *   (a) any effects on the environment or existing interests of allowing the activity, including---

    *   (f) the economic benefit to New Zealand of allowing the application; and
    
    *   (g) the efficient use and development of natural resources; and
    
    *   (h) the nature and effect of other marine management regimes; and
    
    *   (i) best practice in relation to an industry or activity; and
    
    *   (j) the extent to which imposing conditions under section 63 might avoid, remedy, or mitigate the adverse effects of the activity; and
    
    *   (k) relevant regulations; and
    
    *   (l) any other applicable law; and
    
    *   (m) any other matter the EPA considers relevant and reasonably necessary to determine the application.
    
    (3) The EPA must have regard to---
        
    *   (a) any submissions made and evidence given in relation to the application; and
    
    *   (b) any advice, reports, or information it has sought and received in relation to the application; and
    
    *   (c) any advice received from the Māori Advisory Committee.
    
    (4) When considering an application affected by [section 74][110], the EPA must also have regard to the value of the investment in the activity of the existing consent holder.
    
    (5) Despite subsection (3), the EPA must not have regard to---
        
    *   (a) trade competition or the effects of trade competition; or
    
    *   (b) the effects on climate change of discharging greenhouse gases into the air; or

##### 60 Matters to be considered in deciding extent of adverse effects on existing interests
    
*   In considering the effects of an activity on existing interests under [section 59(2)(a)][93], the Environmental Protection Authority must have regard to---
        
    *   (a) the area that the activity would have in common with the existing interest; and
    
    *   (b) the degree to which both the activity and the existing interest must be carried out to the exclusion of other activities; and
    
    *   (c) whether the existing interest can be exercised only in the area to which the application relates; and
    
    *   (d) any other relevant matter.
    
    

##### 61 Information principles
    
*   (1) When considering an application for a marine consent, the Environmental Protection Authority must---
        
    *   (a) make full use of its powers to request information from the applicant, obtain advice, and commission a review or a report; and
    
    *   (b) base decisions on the best available information; and
    
    *   (c) take into account any uncertainty or inadequacy in the information available.
    
    (2) If, in relation to making a decision under this Act, the information available is uncertain or inadequate, the EPA must favour caution and environmental protection.
    
    (3) If favouring caution and environmental protection means that an activity is likely to be refused, the EPA must first consider whether taking an adaptive management approach would allow the activity to be undertaken.
    
    (4) Subsection (3) does not limit [section 63][97] or [64][98].
    
    (5) In this section, _best available information_ means the best information that, in the particular circumstances, is available without unreasonable cost, effort, or time.

##### 62 Decisions on applications for marine consents
    
*   (1) After complying with [sections 59 to 61][93], the EPA may---
        
    *   (a) grant an application for a marine consent, in whole or in part, and issue a consent; or
    
    *   (b) refuse the application.
    
    (2) To avoid doubt, the EPA may refuse an application for a consent if it considers that it does not have adequate information to determine the application.
    
    (3) If the EPA grants the application, it may issue the consent subject to conditions under [section 63][97].

##### 63 Conditions of marine consents
    
*   (1) The Environmental Protection Authority may grant a marine consent on any condition that it considers appropriate to deal with adverse effects of the activity authorised by the consent on the environment or existing interests.
    
    (2) The conditions that the EPA may impose include, but are not limited to, conditions---
        
    *   (a) requiring the consent holder to---
            
        *   (i) provide a bond for the performance of any 1 or more conditions of the consent:
        
        *   (ii) obtain and maintain public liability insurance of a specified value:
        
        *   (iii) monitor, and report on, the exercise of the consent and the effects of the activity it authorises:
        
        *   (iv) appoint an observer to monitor the activity authorised by the consent and its effects on the environment:
        
        *   (v) make records related to the activity authorised by the consent available for audit:
        
        
    
    *   (b) that together amount or contribute to an adaptive management approach.
    
    (3) However, the EPA must not impose a condition on a consent if the condition would be inconsistent with this Act or any regulations.
    
    (4) To avoid doubt, the EPA may not impose a condition to deal with an effect if the condition would conflict with a measure required in relation to the activity by another marine management regime or the [Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992][314].

##### 64 Adaptive management approach
    
*   (1) The Environmental Protection Authority may incorporate an adaptive management approach into a marine consent granted for an activity.
    
    (2) An _adaptive management approach_ includes---
        
    *   (a) allowing an activity to commence on a small scale or for a short period so that its effects on the environment and existing interests can be monitored:
    
    *   (b) any other approach that allows an activity to be undertaken so that its effects can be assessed and the activity discontinued, or continued with or without amendment, on the basis of those effects.
    
    (3) In order to incorporate an adaptive management approach into a marine consent, the EPA may impose conditions under [section 63][97] that authorise the activity to be undertaken in stages, with a requirement for regular monitoring and reporting before the next stage of the activity may be undertaken or the activity continued for the next period.
    
    (4) A stage may relate to the duration of the consent, the area over which the consent is granted, the scale or intensity of the activity, or the nature of the activity.

##### 65 Bonds
    
*   (1) A bond required under [section 63(2)(a)(i)][97] may be given for the performance of any 1 or more conditions of a marine consent that the Environmental Protection Authority considers appropriate and may continue after the expiry of the consent to secure the ongoing performance of conditions relating to long-term effects, including---
        
    *   (a) a condition relating to the alteration, demolition, or removal of structures:
    
    *   (b) a condition relating to remedial, restoration, or maintenance work:
    
    *   (c) a condition providing for ongoing monitoring of long-term effects.
    
    (2) A condition of a consent that describes the terms of the bond may---
        
    *   (a) require that the bond be given before the consent is exercised or at any other time:
    
    *   (b) provide that the liability of the holder of the consent be not limited to the amount of the bond:
    
    *   (c) require the bond to be given to secure performance of conditions of the consent, including conditions relating to any adverse effects on the environment or existing interests that become apparent during or after the expiry of the consent:
    
    *   (d) require the holder of the consent to provide such security as the EPA thinks fit for the performance of any condition of the bond:
    
    *   (e) require the holder of the consent to provide a guarantor (acceptable to the EPA) to bind itself to pay for the carrying out of a condition in the event of a default by the holder or the occurrence of an adverse environmental effect requiring remedy:
    
    *   (f) provide that the bond may be varied, cancelled, or renewed at any time by agreement between the holder and the EPA.
    
    (3) If the EPA considers that an adverse effect may continue or arise at any time after the expiration of a marine consent, the EPA may require that a bond continue for a specified period that the EPA thinks fit.

##### 66 Monitoring conditions
    
*   (1) A condition imposed under [section 63(2)(a)(iii)][97] may require the consent holder to do 1 or more of the following:
        
    *   (a) make and record measurements:
    
    *   (b) take and supply samples:

    (2) This section does not limit [section 63(2)(a)(iii)][97].

##### 67 Observers
    
*   (1) A condition imposed under [section 63(2)(a)(iv)][97] that requires the holder of a consent to appoint an observer must specify in detail the observer's duties in relation to the activity.
    
    (2) The consent holder may appoint a person to be an observer only if the person is approved by the EPA for that purpose.
    
    (3) The EPA must approve a person to be an observer in relation to a consent if---
        
    *   (a) the person has the appropriate training, skill, and experience to perform the duties; and
    
    *   (b) the EPA is satisfied that the person is able to perform the duties independently of the consent holder.
    
    

##### 68 Time limits for Environmental Protection Authority's decision
    
*   (1) The Environmental Protection Authority must make its decision on an application for a marine consent for a publicly notifiable activity as soon as is reasonably practicable and,---
        
    *   (a) if a hearing is held, no later than 20 working days after the conclusion of the hearing; or

    (7) To avoid doubt, the power to change a condition includes the power to cancel a condition or impose a new condition.

##### 82 Decision on review of duration of consent
    
*   (1) The Environmental Protection Authority may shorten the duration of a marine consent on a review under [section 76][114] only if the effects of the activity authorised by the consent, or the scale or intensity of the effects, were not anticipated when the consent was granted and shortening the duration is the only way to avoid, remedy, or mitigate the effects appropriately.
    
    (2) The EPA may extend the duration of a consent on a review under [section 76][114] only if the monitoring of the effects shows that the effects are minor or may be avoided, remedied, or mitigated by imposing conditions.
    
    (3) A change in the duration of a consent after a review must not result in the duration of the consent exceeding 35 years.
    
    (4) The consent holder may object, under [section 101][148], to a decision to shorten or not to extend the duration of a consent.

##### 83 Process for minor changes to consent conditions

    *   (a) the consent is given effect to; or
    
    *   (b) an application is made to the Environmental Protection Authority to extend the period after which the consent lapses, and the EPA decides to grant an extension after taking into account---
            
        *   (i) whether substantial progress or effort has been, and continues to be, made towards giving effect to the consent; and
        
        *   (ii) whether the applicant has obtained approval from persons who may be adversely affected by the granting of an extension; and
        
        *   (iii) relevant enactments.
        
        
    
    (2) The consent holder may object, under [section 101][148], to a decision of the EPA under subsection (1)(b) not to extend the period after which the consent lapses.

##### 86 Cancellation of consent if not exercised
    
*   (1) The Environmental Protection Authority may cancel a marine consent by written notice served on the consent holder if the consent has been exercised in the past but has not been exercised during the preceding 5 years.
    
    (2) However, despite subsection (1), the consent holder may ask the EPA to revoke the notice no later than 3 months after service of the notice.
    
    (3) In deciding whether to revoke the notice, the EPA must take into account---
        
    *   (a) whether the applicant has obtained approval from persons whose existing interests may be adversely affected by the revocation of the notice; and
    
    *   (b) how any regulations classify and provide for the activity authorised by the consent in relation to the area to which the consent relates.
    
    (4) Subsection (1) does not apply if the consent expressly provides otherwise.
    
    (5) The consent holder may object, under [section 101][148], if the EPA refuses to revoke a notice.

##### 87 Change or cancellation of consent conditions on application by consent holder
    
*   (1) The holder of a marine consent may request the Environmental Protection Authority to change or cancel a condition of the consent.
    
    (2) [Sections 38 to 71][63] apply, with all necessary modifications, as if---
        
    *   (a) the request were an application for a marine consent; and
    
    *   (b) the references to a marine consent and to the activity were references only to the change or cancellation of a condition and the effects of the change or cancellation respectively.
    
    (3) However, if the EPA considers that the requested change or cancellation is likely---
        
    *   (a) to affect the existing interests of only some of the persons described in subsection (4), it may notify those persons and may, but need not, give public notice of the request under [section 45][76]; or
    
    *   (b) to be limited to minor matters, it may deal with the request under [section 83][122].
    
    (4) For the purposes of determining who is adversely affected by the change or cancellation, the EPA must consider, in particular, every person who---
        
    *   (a) made a submission on the original application; and
    
    *   (b) has an existing interest that may be affected by the change or cancellation.
    
    (5) If the EPA decides, under subsection (3)(a), not to give public notice of the request, the EPA may, but need not, give public notice of its decision under [section 70][104].
    
    (6) The consent holder may object, under [section 101][148], if the EPA refuses to change or cancel the condition as requested by the consent holder.

#### Cost recovery

##### 143 Principles of cost recovery
    
*   (1) The Environmental Protection Authority must take all reasonable steps to recover so much of the direct and indirect costs incurred in performing its functions and providing services under this Act as are not provided for by money appropriated by Parliament for the purpose.
    
    (2) The functions and services include those performed in relation to---
        
    *   (a) assisting a person in the preparation of an application for a marine consent, whether or not the application is made:
    
    *   (b) receiving, processing, and deciding applications for marine consents:
    
    *   (c) receiving impact assessments provided under [section 22][31], [161][227], or [166][234]:
    
    *   (d) administering, monitoring, and supervising marine consents:
    
    *   (e) certifying that an activity complies with regulations:
    
    *   (f) advising a person proposing to undertake a permitted activity:
    
    *   (g) processing information that regulations require a person undertaking a permitted activity to provide, and monitoring a permitted activity if the monitoring is required by regulations:
    
    *   (h) reviewing the conditions or duration of a marine consent.
    
    (3) In determining the most appropriate method of cost recovery under [section 144][202], and its level, in any particular case, the Minister must have regard, as far as is reasonably practicable, to the following criteria:
        
    *   (a) equity, in that funding for a particular function or service or a particular class of function or service should generally, and to the extent practicable, be recovered from---
            
        *   (i) the person, or class of persons, who benefits from the performance of the function or service and at a level proportional to the person's or class of persons' benefit from the function or service; or
        
        *   (ii) the person, or class of persons, whose action or inaction gives rise to the exercise of the function at a level proportional to the person's or class of persons' contribution to the cost of performing the function:
        
        
    
    *   (b) efficiency, in that costs should generally be allocated and recovered in order to ensure that maximum benefits are delivered at minimum cost:
    
    *   (c) justification, in that costs should be collected only to meet the actual and reasonable costs (including indirect costs) of the performance of the relevant function or service:
    
    *   (d) transparency, in that costs should be identified and allocated as closely as practicable in relation to a function or service for the recovery period in which the function or service is performed.
    
    (4) Nothing in this section requires a strict apportionment of the costs to be recovered for a particular function or service based on usage, and, without limiting the way in which charges may be set, a charge may be set at a level or in a way that---
        
    *   (a) is determined by calculations that involve an averaging of costs or potential costs:
    
    *   (b) takes into account costs or potential costs of functions or services that do not directly benefit the person who pays the charge, but which are an indirect or potential cost arising from the performance of the function or service in question to a class of persons.
    
    

##### 144 Methods of cost recovery
    
*   Costs may be recovered for the purpose of [section 143(1)][201] by 1 or more of the following methods:
        
    *   (a) fixed charges:
    
    *   (b) charges based on a scale or formula or at a rate determined on an hourly or other unit basis:
    
    *   (c) charges for actual and reasonable costs spent in or associated with the performance of a function or service:
    
    *   (d) estimated charges, or charges based on estimated costs, paid before the performance of the function or service, followed by reconciliation and an appropriate further payment or refund after performance of the function or service:
    
    *   (e) refundable or non-refundable deposits paid before performance of the function or service.
    
    

##### 145 Cost recovery to relate generally to financial year
    
*   (1) Any regulations that prescribe a charge that applies in any financial year---
        
    *   (a) must have been made before the start of the financial year; but
    
    *   (b) apply in that year and all subsequent years until revoked or replaced, except as the regulations may otherwise provide.
    
    (2) Subsection (1) does not prevent the alteration or setting during any financial year of a charge payable in that year, if either---
        
    *   (a) the charge is reduced, removed, or restated without substantive alteration; or
    
    *   (b) in the case of an increase or a new charge,---
            
        *   (i) appropriate consultation has been carried out with persons or representatives of persons substantially affected by the increase or the new charge; and
        
        *   (ii) the Minister is satisfied that those persons, or their representatives, agree or do not substantially disagree with the increase or the new charge.
        
        
    
    (3) Despite subsection (1), regulations may prescribe a charge during the financial year in which this Act commences, and subsection (2)(b)(ii) does not apply.
    
    (4) Subsection (1) does not prevent the amendment of any regulation prescribing a charge if any substantive alteration effected by the amendment is for the purpose of correcting an error.
    
    (5) In any financial year, recovery may be made of any shortfall in cost recovery for any of the preceding 4 financial years, and allowance may be made for any over-recovery of costs in those years (including any estimated shortfall or over-recovery for the immediately preceding financial year).

##### 146 Charges to be prescribed by regulations
    
*   (1) Regulations may be made under [section 30][51] prescribing charges for the purposes of this Act.
    
    (2) The charges may be prescribed using any 1 or more of the methods specified in [section 144][202].
    
    (3) The charges prescribed may---
        
    *   (a) differ depending on whether a special or urgent function or service is performed:
    
    *   (b) include more than 1 level of charge for the same function or service provided in different ways, or provided in or in respect of different places:
    
    *   (c) differ for otherwise similar functions or services provided in different ways:
    
    *   (d) differ depending on the time taken to perform the function or service required or the components of the function or service required for the particular person or class of persons.
    
    

##### 147 Charges constitute debt due to Environmental Protection Authority
    
*   (1) A charge or part of a charge that is not paid by the due date is a debt due to the EPA.
    
    (2) The EPA may recover the debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.
    
    (3) If a charge is payable to the EPA, the EPA need not perform any action to which the charge relates until the charge has been paid in full.
