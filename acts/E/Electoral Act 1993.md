    (6) The quotient of each successive division shall be recorded on the working sheet.
    
    (7) Once the quotient of each successive division is entered on the working sheet, the Electoral Commission must then proceed to ascertain from a comparison of all the figures in the working sheet in [form 15][943] listed under the heading ""Quotients of divisions"", the highest 120 quotients or such lower number as is required by subsection (8).

    (10) The Electoral Commission, having ascertained the numbers required by subsection (7), must cause a circle to be drawn on the working sheet around each of those numbers.
