An Act to incorporate the trustees of the will of Eliza White, of Christchurch, widow, deceased, and to vary the trusts of the said will
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    Whereas Eliza White, late of Christchurch, widow, died on 13 November 1909, having first made her last will and testament bearing date 10 March 1907 and 1 codicil of the same date not material to the present situation, which will and codicil were proved in the Supreme Court of New Zealand at Christchurch on 9 December 1909:
    
    And whereas the present trustees of the said will and codicil are Maud Magdalean White, of Christchurch, spinster, Beatrice Joseph Bunz, of Christchurch, widow, 2 of the daughters, and Charles Joseph James Morkane, of Christchurch, medical practitioner, a grandson of the testatrix:
    
    And whereas, after bequeathing certain legacies and making certain dispositions of her property, the testatrix devised and bequeathed the residue of her real and personal estate to her trustees upon trust out of income thereof to pay certain annuities, with power to apply the surplus income of her estate in paying off mortgages charged on her real estate or such further mortgages as she empowered her trustees to raise for the purpose of building upon or improving her said real estate, with power for her trustees to sell the whole or any part of her real and personal estate, and by her said will she further directed that her trustees are to stand possessed of the residue of her real and personal estate subject as aforesaid in trust for the purpose of founding, building, equipping, and maintaining 2 orphanages in or near Christchurch, one for the reception of destitute female orphan children and the other for the reception of destitute male orphan children, the orphanage for female orphan children to be first established and the orphanage for male orphan children not to be undertaken unless or until the trust estate of the testatrix shall be more than sufficient for the one first to be established, and by the said will she further directed that each such orphanage should be placed under the immediate management of some recognized religious order in the Roman Catholic Church approved of for the purposes by the Roman Catholic Bishop of Christchurch for the time being, and to be called Saint Joseph's Orphanage, and she further directed that the trustees should associate themselves with the Roman Catholic Bishop for the time being in all matters connected with the admission of children to the orphanage and the general policy of management thereof:
    
    And whereas, in pursuance of such directions, the trustees have purchased all that parcel of land containing 11 acres 2 roods 25 perches, situated in the Lincoln Road, of Christchurch, being Lot 1 on Deposited Plan 9989, Part Rural Section 141, and being the whole of the land comprised and described in certificate of title, Volume 432, folio 90, and have thereon erected and equipped one such orphanage for the reception of female orphans, known as the Eliza White St. Joseph's Orphanage:
    
    And whereas, in order the more effectually to facilitate the administration of the trusts of the said will, it is desirable to incorporate the trustees of the said will as a body corporate and to enlarge their numbers and to include the said Bishop for the time being as a member of such body while as far as reasonably possible preserving the representation on that body of the personal descendants of the testatrix and to strengthen it as an administrative body:
    
    And whereas to facilitate the administration of the orphanage it is desirable that the same and the control thereof shall be vested in the Roman Catholic Bishop of Christchurch:
    
    And whereas the resources of the said estate of the testatrix are such that in the opinion of the trustees it is found impossible to erect and equip a second orphanage for male orphan children, and in the circumstances thereof it is desirable that further powers be conferred on the trustees for the time being or other body administering the trusts of the said will.

For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][15] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][16] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][18] and [17E][19] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
