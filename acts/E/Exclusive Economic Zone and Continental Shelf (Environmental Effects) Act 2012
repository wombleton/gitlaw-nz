#### Decisions

##### 59 Environmental Protection Authority's consideration of application
    
*   (1) This section and [sections 60][81] and [61][82] apply when the Environmental Protection Authority is considering an application for a marine consent and submissions on the application.
    
    (2) The EPA must take into account---
        
    *   (a) any effects on the environment or existing interests of allowing the activity, including---
            
        *   (i) cumulative effects; and

    *   (f) the economic benefit to New Zealand of allowing the application; and
    
    *   (g) the efficient use and development of natural resources; and
    
    *   (h) the nature and effect of other marine management regimes; and
    
    *   (i) best practice in relation to an industry or activity; and
    
    *   (j) the extent to which imposing conditions under section 63 might avoid, remedy, or mitigate the adverse effects of the activity; and
    
    *   (k) relevant regulations; and
    
    *   (l) any other applicable law; and
    
    *   (m) any other matter the EPA considers relevant and reasonably necessary to determine the application.
    
    (3) The EPA must have regard to---
        
    *   (a) any submissions made and evidence given in relation to the application; and
    
    *   (b) any advice, reports, or information it has sought and received in relation to the application; and
    
    *   (c) any advice received from the Māori Advisory Committee.
    
    (4) When considering an application affected by [section 74][97], the EPA must also have regard to the value of the investment in the activity of the existing consent holder.
    
    (5) Despite subsection (3), the EPA must not have regard to---
        
    *   (a) trade competition or the effects of trade competition; or
    
    *   (b) the effects on climate change of discharging greenhouse gases into the air; or
    
    *   (c) any effects on a person's existing interest if the person has given written approval to the proposed activity.

    *   (a) the area that the activity would have in common with the existing interest; and
    
    *   (b) the degree to which both the activity and the existing interest must be carried out to the exclusion of other activities; and
    
    *   (c) whether the existing interest can be exercised only in the area to which the application relates; and
    
    *   (d) any other relevant matter.
    
    

##### 61 Information principles
    
*   (1) When considering an application for a marine consent, the Environmental Protection Authority must---
        
    *   (a) make full use of its powers to request information from the applicant, obtain advice, and commission a review or a report; and
    
    *   (b) base decisions on the best available information; and
    
    *   (c) take into account any uncertainty or inadequacy in the information available.
    
    (2) If, in relation to making a decision under this Act, the information available is uncertain or inadequate, the EPA must favour caution and environmental protection.
    
    (3) If favouring caution and environmental protection means that an activity is likely to be refused, the EPA must first consider whether taking an adaptive management approach would allow the activity to be undertaken.
    
    (4) Subsection (3) does not limit [section 63][84] or [64][85].
    
    (5) In this section, _best available information_ means the best information that, in the particular circumstances, is available without unreasonable cost, effort, or time.

##### 62 Decisions on applications for marine consents
    
*   (1) After complying with [sections 59 to 61][80], the EPA may---
        
    *   (a) grant an application for a marine consent, in whole or in part, and issue a consent; or
    
    *   (b) refuse the application.
    
    (2) To avoid doubt, the EPA may refuse an application for a consent if it considers that it does not have adequate information to determine the application.
    
    (3) If the EPA grants the application, it may issue the consent subject to conditions under [section 63][84].

##### 63 Conditions of marine consents
    
*   (1) The Environmental Protection Authority may grant a marine consent on any condition that it considers appropriate to deal with adverse effects of the activity authorised by the consent on the environment or existing interests.
    
    (2) The conditions that the EPA may impose include, but are not limited to, conditions---
        
    *   (a) requiring the consent holder to---
            
        *   (i) provide a bond for the performance of any 1 or more conditions of the consent:
        
        *   (ii) obtain and maintain public liability insurance of a specified value:
        
        *   (iii) monitor, and report on, the exercise of the consent and the effects of the activity it authorises:
        
        *   (iv) appoint an observer to monitor the activity authorised by the consent and its effects on the environment:
        
        *   (v) make records related to the activity authorised by the consent available for audit:
        
        
    
    *   (b) that together amount or contribute to an adaptive management approach.
    
    (3) However, the EPA must not impose a condition on a consent if the condition would be inconsistent with this Act or any regulations.
    
    (4) To avoid doubt, the EPA may not impose a condition to deal with an effect if the condition would conflict with a measure required in relation to the activity by another marine management regime or the [Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992][283].

##### 64 Adaptive management approach
    
*   (1) The Environmental Protection Authority may incorporate an adaptive management approach into a marine consent granted for an activity.
    
    (2) An _adaptive management approach_ includes---
        
    *   (a) allowing an activity to commence on a small scale or for a short period so that its effects on the environment and existing interests can be monitored:
    
    *   (b) any other approach that allows an activity to be undertaken so that its effects can be assessed and the activity discontinued, or continued with or without amendment, on the basis of those effects.
    
    (3) In order to incorporate an adaptive management approach into a marine consent, the EPA may impose conditions under [section 63][84] that authorise the activity to be undertaken in stages, with a requirement for regular monitoring and reporting before the next stage of the activity may be undertaken or the activity continued for the next period.
    
    (4) A stage may relate to the duration of the consent, the area over which the consent is granted, the scale or intensity of the activity, or the nature of the activity.

##### 65 Bonds
    
*   (1) A bond required under [section 63(2)(a)(i)][84] may be given for the performance of any 1 or more conditions of a marine consent that the Environmental Protection Authority considers appropriate and may continue after the expiry of the consent to secure the ongoing performance of conditions relating to long-term effects, including---
        
    *   (a) a condition relating to the alteration, demolition, or removal of structures:
    
    *   (b) a condition relating to remedial, restoration, or maintenance work:
    
    *   (c) a condition providing for ongoing monitoring of long-term effects.
    
    (2) A condition of a consent that describes the terms of the bond may---
        
    *   (a) require that the bond be given before the consent is exercised or at any other time:
    
    *   (b) provide that the liability of the holder of the consent be not limited to the amount of the bond:
    
    *   (c) require the bond to be given to secure performance of conditions of the consent, including conditions relating to any adverse effects on the environment or existing interests that become apparent during or after the expiry of the consent:
    
    *   (d) require the holder of the consent to provide such security as the EPA thinks fit for the performance of any condition of the bond:
    
    *   (e) require the holder of the consent to provide a guarantor (acceptable to the EPA) to bind itself to pay for the carrying out of a condition in the event of a default by the holder or the occurrence of an adverse environmental effect requiring remedy:
    
    *   (f) provide that the bond may be varied, cancelled, or renewed at any time by agreement between the holder and the EPA.
    
    (3) If the EPA considers that an adverse effect may continue or arise at any time after the expiration of a marine consent, the EPA may require that a bond continue for a specified period that the EPA thinks fit.

##### 66 Monitoring conditions
    
*   (1) A condition imposed under [section 63(2)(a)(iii)][84] may require the consent holder to do 1 or more of the following:
        
    *   (a) make and record measurements:
    
    *   (b) take and supply samples:

    (2) This section does not limit [section 63(2)(a)(iii)][84].

##### 67 Observers
    
*   (1) A condition imposed under [section 63(2)(a)(iv)][84] that requires the holder of a consent to appoint an observer must specify in detail the observer's duties in relation to the activity.
    
    (2) The consent holder may appoint a person to be an observer only if the person is approved by the EPA for that purpose.
    
    (3) The EPA must approve a person to be an observer in relation to a consent if---
        
    *   (a) the person has the appropriate training, skill, and experience to perform the duties; and
    
    *   (b) the EPA is satisfied that the person is able to perform the duties independently of the consent holder.
    
    

##### 68 Time limits for Environmental Protection Authority's decision
    
*   The Environmental Protection Authority must make its decision on an application for a marine consent as soon as is reasonably practicable and,---
        
    *   (a) if a hearing is held, no later than 20 working days after the conclusion of the hearing; or
    
    *   (b) if a hearing is not held, no later than 20 working days after the closing date for making submissions under [section 47][66].

    *   (d) if the information made available to the EPA by the applicant for the consent for the purposes of the application contained inaccuracies that materially influenced the decision made on the application and the effects of the exercise of the consent are such that it is necessary to apply more appropriate conditions:
    
    *   (e) if information becomes available to the EPA that was not available to the EPA when the consent was granted and the information shows that more appropriate conditions are necessary to deal with the effects of the exercise of the consent.
    
    (2) The EPA must, in accordance with [section 78][103], serve notice on a consent holder of its intention to review the conditions of a marine consent if required by an order made under [section 133(5)(b)][174].

##### 77 Contents of notice of review

    (2) The EPA must serve a copy of the public notice on the persons specified in [section 45(1)][63] and that provision applies as if reference to an application for a marine consent were reference to a notice of review.
    
    (3) The public notice must---
        
    *   (a) be in the prescribed form; and
    
    *   (b) give a summary of the notice of review; and

##### 79 Further information, advice, submissions, and hearing
    
*   (1) [Sections 42 to 58][60] apply, with all necessary modifications, to a review of a marine consent as if---
        
    *   (a) the notice of review were an application for a marine consent; and
    
    *   (b) the consent holder were the applicant for the marine consent.
    
    (2) However, [section 44(1)(a)][62] does not apply to a review.

##### 80 Matters to be considered in review
    
*   When reviewing the conditions of a marine consent, the Environmental Protection Authority---

##### 81 Decisions on review of consent conditions
    
*   (1) The Environmental Protection Authority may change a condition of a marine consent on a review under [section 76][101] only if 1 or more of the circumstances specified in that section apply.
    
    (2) [Sections 63 to 71][84] (which relate to conditions, decisions, notification, and commencement) and [sections 105][139] and [113][148] (which relate to appeals) apply, with all necessary modifications, to a review as if---
        
    *   (a) the review were an application for a marine consent; and
    
    *   (b) the consent holder were an applicant for a marine consent.
    
    (3) The EPA may cancel a consent if the review was initiated under [section 76(1)(c)][101], (d), (e), or (2) and the activity authorised by the consent has significant adverse effects on the environment or existing interests.
    
    (4) If the EPA cancels a consent, the EPA may---
        
    *   (a) set a timetable for the consent holder to cease the activity; and
    
    *   (b) direct the consent holder to take any other action in relation to any structures used for the activity; and
    
    *   (c) direct the consent holder to take action to avoid, remedy, or mitigate adverse effects caused by the activity.
    
    (5) The consent holder must comply with the timetable set by the EPA and with any other directions of the EPA.
    
    (6) The consent holder may object, under [section 101][134], to a decision to change a condition of a consent or to cancel a consent.
    
    (7) To avoid doubt, the power to change a condition includes the power to cancel a condition or impose a new condition.

##### 82 Decision on review of duration of consent
    
*   (1) The Environmental Protection Authority may shorten the duration of a marine consent on a review under [section 76][101] only if the effects of the activity authorised by the consent, or the scale or intensity of the effects, were not anticipated when the consent was granted and shortening the duration is the only way to avoid, remedy, or mitigate the effects appropriately.
    
    (2) The EPA may extend the duration of a consent on a review under [section 76][101] only if the monitoring of the effects shows that the effects are minor or may be avoided, remedied, or mitigated by imposing conditions.
    
    (3) A change in the duration of a consent after a review must not result in the duration of the consent exceeding 35 years.
    
    (4) The consent holder may object, under [section 101][134], to a decision to shorten or not to extend the duration of a consent.

##### 83 Process for minor changes to consent conditions
    
*   (1) If the Environmental Protection Authority considers that a review is likely to be limited to minor changes to the conditions of a consent, it may deal with the review without notifying the review under [section 78][103].
    
    (2) If the EPA deals with a review under subsection (1), [section 79][104] does not apply to the review.
    
    (3) However, despite subsection (2), the EPA must allow the consent holder to make a submission and request a hearing.
    
    (4) As a result of a review under this section, the EPA may not---
        
    *   (a) cancel a consent; or
    
    *   (b) make changes to the conditions of a consent that are more than minor.
    
    (5) The consent holder may object, under [section 101][134], to a decision by the EPA to change consent conditions.

##### 84 Minor corrections of marine consents
    
*   The EPA may issue an amended consent to correct minor mistakes or defects in a consent within 15 working days after the granting of the consent.

#### Cancellation of marine consents

##### 85 Lapsing of consent if not exercised
    
*   (1) A marine consent lapses on the date specified in the consent or, if no date is specified, 5 years after the date of commencement of the consent unless, before the consent lapses,---
        
    *   (a) the consent is given effect to; or
    
    *   (b) an application is made to the Environmental Protection Authority to extend the period after which the consent lapses, and the EPA decides to grant an extension after taking into account---
            
        *   (i) whether substantial progress or effort has been, and continues to be, made towards giving effect to the consent; and
        
        *   (ii) whether the applicant has obtained approval from persons who may be adversely affected by the granting of an extension; and
        
        *   (iii) relevant enactments.
        
        
    
    (2) The consent holder may object, under [section 101][134], to a decision of the EPA under subsection (1)(b) not to extend the period after which the consent lapses.

##### 86 Cancellation of consent if not exercised
    
*   (1) The Environmental Protection Authority may cancel a marine consent by written notice served on the consent holder if the consent has been exercised in the past but has not been exercised during the preceding 5 years.
    
    (2) However, despite subsection (1), the consent holder may ask the EPA to revoke the notice no later than 3 months after service of the notice.
    
    (3) In deciding whether to revoke the notice, the EPA must take into account---
        
    *   (a) whether the applicant has obtained approval from persons whose existing interests may be adversely affected by the revocation of the notice; and
    
    *   (b) how any regulations classify and provide for the activity authorised by the consent in relation to the area to which the consent relates.
    
    (4) Subsection (1) does not apply if the consent expressly provides otherwise.
    
    (5) The consent holder may object, under [section 101][134], if the EPA refuses to revoke a notice.

##### 87 Change or cancellation of consent conditions on application by consent holder
    
*   (1) The holder of a marine consent may request the Environmental Protection Authority to change or cancel a condition of the consent.
    
    (2) [Sections 38 to 71][56] apply, with all necessary modifications, as if---
        
    *   (a) the request were an application for a marine consent; and
    
    *   (b) the references to a marine consent and to the activity were references only to the change or cancellation of a condition and the effects of the change or cancellation respectively.
    
    (3) However, if the EPA considers that the requested change or cancellation is likely---
        
    *   (a) to affect the existing interests of only some of the persons described in subsection (4), it may notify those persons and may, but need not, give public notice of the request under [section 45][63]; or
    
    *   (b) to be limited to minor matters, it may deal with the request under [section 83][108].
    
    (4) For the purposes of determining who is adversely affected by the change or cancellation, the EPA must consider, in particular, every person who---
        
    *   (a) made a submission on the original application; and
    
    *   (b) has an existing interest that may be affected by the change or cancellation.
    
    (5) If the EPA decides, under subsection (3)(a), not to give public notice of the request, the EPA may, but need not, give public notice of its decision under [section 70][91].
    
    (6) The consent holder may object, under [section 101][134], if the EPA refuses to change or cancel the condition as requested by the consent holder.

#### EPA may decide whether joint or separate applications for consent required

##### 90 Application for consent for cross-boundary activity
    
*   A person who intends to undertake a cross-boundary activity may--- 
        
    *   (a) prepare a joint application for consent that complies with the requirements of---
            
        *   (i) this Act and any regulations in relation to the part of the activity that relates to the exclusive economic zone or the continental shelf; and
        
        *   (ii) the [Resource Management Act 1991][248], and any regulations, national environmental standards, or regional or district plans made under that Act, in relation to the part of the activity that relates to New Zealand; or
        
        
    
    *   (b) apply for a marine consent and a resource consent for a cross-boundary activity separately, whether concurrently or at different times.
    
    

##### 91 Joint application for consent for cross-boundary activity
    
*   (1) This section applies if a person makes a joint application for consent.
    
    (2) The joint application must be sent to both the relevant consent authority and the Environmental Protection Authority.
    
    (3) The joint application must include an assessment of effects that complies with [section 88(2)(b)][294] of the Resource Management Act 1991 and [section 39][57] of this Act.
    
    (4) The joint application may specify that the application for resource consent is lodged with the EPA under [section 145][296] of the Resource Management Act 1991\.

##### 92 Separate applications for consents for cross-boundary activity
    
*   [Subpart 2][54] applies to an application for a marine consent if a person---
        
    *   (a) applies separately for consents for a cross-boundary activity, as described in [section 90(b)][118]; or
    
    *   (b) applies for a marine consent in relation to a cross-boundary activity and does not apply for a resource consent for the activity.
    
    

##### 93 Environmental Protection Authority may require joint application
    
*   (1) At any time before or during the processing of an application for a marine consent for a cross-boundary activity, the Environmental Protection Authority may decide (whether on a request by the applicant or on its own initiative) that the application ought to be processed and heard (if a hearing is held) with an application for resource consent for the activity.
    
    (2) Subsection (1) applies despite a decision by an applicant to apply separately for resource and marine consents under [section 90(b)][118] and despite [section 92][120].
    
    (3) In the case described in subsection (1), the EPA may decide---
        
    *   (a) not to proceed with the notification or hearing of the application for a marine consent until the application for resource consent is lodged with it and the relevant consent authority; or
    
    *   (b) return the application for a marine consent to the applicant as incomplete under [section 41][59].
    
    (4) The EPA must inform the applicant of its decision under subsection (1) as soon as practicable after making the decision.
    
    (5) If the EPA makes the decision in subsection (3)(a) and the applicant then lodges an application for a resource consent for the cross-boundary activity, the application for resource consent and the application for a marine consent are a new joint application for consent made on the date on which the application for a resource consent was lodged.

##### 94 Decision to separate joint application for consent
    
*   (1) At any time during the processing of a joint application for consent, the Environmental Protection Authority may decide that the application for a resource consent and the application for a marine consent that comprise the joint application must cease to be processed as a joint application and continue to be processed separately.
    
    (2) Subsection (1) applies only if---
        
    *   (a) the EPA and the relevant consent authority agree that the applications are sufficiently unrelated that a joint process is not necessary; or
    
    *   (b) the application for resource consent does not require public notification under the [Resource Management Act 1991][248]; or
    
    *   (c) a hearing is required for one application but not the other; or
    
    *   (d) the joint processing of the applications for resource consent and marine consent that comprise the joint application for consent is not administratively efficient.
    
    (3) In any case described in subsection (1),---
        
    *   (a) the relevant consent authority must resume processing the application for resource consent under the [Resource Management Act 1991][248]; and
    
    *   (b) the EPA must resume processing the application for a marine consent under [subpart 2][54].
    
    (4) The EPA must cease processing a joint application for consent if---
        
    *   (a) the Minister for the Environment or the Minister of Conservation (in relation to a proposal of national significance) directs that the application for a resource consent be referred to the Environment Court for decision under [section 142(2)(b)][297] or [147(1)(b)][298] of the Resource Management Act 1991; or
    
    *   (b) the relevant consent authority agrees to the applicant's request made under [section 87D][299] of the Resource Management Act 1991 to allow the application to be determined by the Environment Court.
    
    (5) In the case described in subsection (4)(a), [section 149T][300] of the Resource Management Act 1991 applies to the application for resource consent.
    
    (6) In the case described in subsection (4)(b), [sections 87F(2) to (5)][301] and [87G to 87I][302] of the Resource Management Act 1991 apply to the application for resource consent.
    
    (7) In both cases described in subsection (4), the EPA must resume processing the application for a marine consent under [subpart 2][54].

#### Processing of joint application

*   [Sections 96][125] and [97][126] apply to the processing of a joint application for consent while the application is a joint application.

##### 96 Environmental Protection Authority to administer process
    
*   (1) The Environmental Protection Authority is responsible for ensuring the efficient and co-ordinated processing of a joint application for consent for a cross-boundary activity.
    
    (2) The EPA must, in relation to the joint application, liaise with the relevant consent authority to---
        
    *   (a) prepare a request for further information under [section 42][60] so that, where practicable, the request covers all the information needed in relation to the whole cross-boundary activity; and
    
    *   (b) ensure that the application is notified jointly by the EPA and the relevant consent authority; and
    
    *   (c) set a closing date for the making of submissions; and
    
    *   (d) receive submissions and provide copies of them to the consent authority; and
    
    *   (e) set the hearing time, date, and venue, and notify submitters of those matters; and
    
    *   (f) set the procedure for the hearing; and
    
    *   (g) provide general administrative services.
    
    (3) The EPA may extend a time period that applies to the processing of the application for a marine consent in order to ensure that---
        
    *   (a) the application for a marine consent is notified jointly with the application for resource consent:
    
    *   (b) submissions on the applications close on the same date:
    
    *   (c) the applications are heard (if there is a hearing) at the same time and place.
    
    (4) [Section 160(1)][208] and (2) do not apply to the exercise by the EPA of the power to extend a time period under subsection (3).

##### 97 Relevant consent authority and EPA to share information
    
*   (1) The Environmental Protection Authority and the relevant consent authority must provide each other with copies of all information and reports relating to the application received by them after the joint application has been made.
    
    (2) The EPA and the relevant consent authority must provide the information as soon as practicable after they receive the information or report.

##### 98 Separate decisions on marine consent and resource consent applications
    
*   (1) The Environmental Protection Authority must decide the application for a marine consent that is part of a joint application for consent.
    
    (2) [Sections 59 to 71][80] apply to the application for a marine consent.
    
    (3) The relevant consent authority must decide the application for a resource consent that is part of a joint application.

#### Nationally significant cross-boundary activities

##### 99 Application for consent for nationally significant cross-boundary activity referred to board of inquiry
    
*   (1) This section applies if the application for a resource consent for the part of the cross-boundary activity that is to be carried out in the coastal marine area is or is part of a proposal of national significance referred to a board of inquiry under [section 142(2)(a)][297] or [147(1)(a)][298] of the Resource Management Act 1991\.
    
    (2) The Environmental Protection Authority may delegate to the board of inquiry the EPA's functions in relation to an application for a marine consent that relates to the part of the activity that is to be carried out in the exclusive economic zone or in or on the continental shelf.
    
    (3) If the EPA delegates its functions under subsection (2), [sections 50 to 58][70] of this Act do not apply to the application for a marine consent and, instead,---
        
    *   (a) the EPA must process and the board of inquiry must decide the application for a marine consent together with the associated application for a resource consent; and
    
    *   (b) the provisions of the [Resource Management Act 1991][248] specified in subsection (5) apply to the processing of the application for marine consent as if the application for a marine consent were a matter lodged with the EPA under [section 145(1)(a)][296] of the Resource Management Act 1991\.
    
    (4) If subsection (3) applies, the EPA must---

Miscellaneous, transitional provisions, and consequential amendments

### Subpart 1---Miscellaneous

    *   (d) an enforcement officer.
    
    

#### Cost recovery

##### 143 Principles of cost recovery
    
*   (1) The Environmental Protection Authority must take all reasonable steps to recover so much of the direct and indirect costs incurred in performing its functions and providing services under this Act as are not provided for by money appropriated by Parliament for the purpose.
    
    (2) The functions and services include those performed in relation to---
        
    *   (a) assisting a person in the preparation of an application for a marine consent, whether or not the application is made:
    
    *   (b) receiving, processing, and deciding applications for marine consents:
    
    *   (c) receiving impact assessments provided under [section 22][30], [161][211], or [166][218]:
    
    *   (d) administering, monitoring, and supervising marine consents:
    
    *   (e) certifying that an activity complies with regulations:
    
    *   (f) advising a person proposing to undertake a permitted activity:
    
    *   (g) processing information that regulations require a person undertaking a permitted activity to provide, and monitoring a permitted activity if the monitoring is required by regulations:
    
    *   (h) reviewing the conditions or duration of a marine consent.
    
    (3) In determining the most appropriate method of cost recovery under [section 144][188], and its level, in any particular case, the Minister must have regard, as far as is reasonably practicable, to the following criteria:
        
    *   (a) equity, in that funding for a particular function or service or a particular class of function or service should generally, and to the extent practicable, be recovered from---
            
        *   (i) the person, or class of persons, who benefits from the performance of the function or service and at a level proportional to the person's or class of persons' benefit from the function or service; or
        
        *   (ii) the person, or class of persons, whose action or inaction gives rise to the exercise of the function at a level proportional to the person's or class of persons' contribution to the cost of performing the function:
        
        
    
    *   (b) efficiency, in that costs should generally be allocated and recovered in order to ensure that maximum benefits are delivered at minimum cost:
    
    *   (c) justification, in that costs should be collected only to meet the actual and reasonable costs (including indirect costs) of the performance of the relevant function or service:
    
    *   (d) transparency, in that costs should be identified and allocated as closely as practicable in relation to a function or service for the recovery period in which the function or service is performed.
    
    (4) Nothing in this section requires a strict apportionment of the costs to be recovered for a particular function or service based on usage, and, without limiting the way in which charges may be set, a charge may be set at a level or in a way that---
        
    *   (a) is determined by calculations that involve an averaging of costs or potential costs:
    
    *   (b) takes into account costs or potential costs of functions or services that do not directly benefit the person who pays the charge, but which are an indirect or potential cost arising from the performance of the function or service in question to a class of persons.
    
    

##### 144 Methods of cost recovery
    
*   Costs may be recovered for the purpose of [section 143(1)][187] by 1 or more of the following methods:
        
    *   (a) fixed charges:
    
    *   (b) charges based on a scale or formula or at a rate determined on an hourly or other unit basis:
    
    *   (c) charges for actual and reasonable costs spent in or associated with the performance of a function or service:
    
    *   (d) estimated charges, or charges based on estimated costs, paid before the performance of the function or service, followed by reconciliation and an appropriate further payment or refund after performance of the function or service:
    
    *   (e) refundable or non-refundable deposits paid before performance of the function or service.
    
    

##### 145 Cost recovery to relate generally to financial year
    
*   (1) Any regulations that prescribe a charge that applies in any financial year---
        
    *   (a) must have been made before the start of the financial year; but 
    
    *   (b) apply in that year and all subsequent years until revoked or replaced, except as the regulations may otherwise provide.
    
    (2) Subsection (1) does not prevent the alteration or setting during any financial year of a charge payable in that year, if either---
        
    *   (a) the charge is reduced, removed, or restated without substantive alteration; or
    
    *   (b) in the case of an increase or a new charge,---
            
        *   (i) appropriate consultation has been carried out with persons or representatives of persons substantially affected by the increase or the new charge; and
        
        *   (ii) the Minister is satisfied that those persons, or their representatives, agree or do not substantially disagree with the increase or the new charge.
        
        
    
    (3) Despite subsection (1), regulations may prescribe a charge during the financial year in which this Act commences, and subsection (2)(b)(ii) does not apply.
    
    (4) Subsection (1) does not prevent the amendment of any regulation prescribing a charge if any substantive alteration effected by the amendment is for the purpose of correcting an error.
    
    (5) In any financial year, recovery may be made of any shortfall in cost recovery for any of the preceding 4 financial years, and allowance may be made for any over-recovery of costs in those years (including any estimated shortfall or over-recovery for the immediately preceding financial year).

##### 146 Charges to be prescribed by regulations
    
*   (1) Regulations may be made under [section 30][44] prescribing charges for the purposes of this Act.
    
    (2) The charges may be prescribed using any 1 or more of the methods specified in [section 144][188].
    
    (3) The charges prescribed may---
        
    *   (a) differ depending on whether a special or urgent function or service is performed:
    
    *   (b) include more than 1 level of charge for the same function or service provided in different ways, or provided in or in respect of different places:
    
    *   (c) differ for otherwise similar functions or services provided in different ways:
    
    *   (d) differ depending on the time taken to perform the function or service required or the components of the function or service required for the particular person or class of persons.
    
    

##### 147 Charges constitute debt due to Environmental Protection Authority
    
*   (1) A charge or part of a charge that is not paid by the due date is a debt due to the EPA.
    
    (2) The EPA may recover the debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.
    
    (3) If a charge is payable to the EPA, the EPA need not perform any action to which the charge relates until the charge has been paid in full.

##### 149 Service on master or owner of ship
    
*   (1) If the master or owner of a ship is a defendant in a prosecution for an offence against [section 132(1)(a)][171], service on the defendant of a summons or other document is achieved for the purposes of the [Summary Proceedings Act 1957][326] if the summons or other document is---
