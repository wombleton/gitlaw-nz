##### 28 Exclusion of unreliable statements
    
*   (1) This section applies to a criminal proceeding in which the prosecution offers or proposes to offer a statement of a defendant if---
        
    *   (a) the defendant or, if applicable, a co-defendant against whom the statement is offered raises, on the basis of an evidential foundation, the issue of the reliability of the statement and informs the Judge and the prosecution of the grounds for raising the issue; or
    
    *   (b) the Judge raises the issue of the reliability of the statement and informs the prosecution of the grounds for raising the issue.
    
    (2) The Judge must exclude the statement unless satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the circumstances in which the statement was made were not likely to have adversely affected its reliability.
    
    (3) However, subsection (2) does not have effect to exclude a statement made by a defendant if the statement is offered only as evidence of the physical, mental, or psychological condition of the defendant at the time the statement was made or as evidence of whether the statement was made.
    
    (4) Without limiting the matters that a Judge may take into account for the purpose of applying subsection (2), the Judge must, in each case, take into account any of the following matters that are relevant to the case:
        
    *   (a) any pertinent physical, mental, or psychological condition of the defendant when the statement was made (whether apparent or not):
    
    *   (b) any pertinent characteristics of the defendant including any mental, intellectual, or physical disability to which the defendant is subject (whether apparent or not):
    
    *   (c) the nature of any questions put to the defendant and the manner and circumstances in which they were put:
    
    *   (d) the nature of any threat, promise, or representation made to the defendant or any other person.

    *   (a) the defendant or, if applicable, a co-defendant against whom the statement is offered raises, on the basis of an evidential foundation, the issue of whether the statement was influenced by oppression and informs the Judge and the prosecution of the grounds for raising the issue; or
    
    *   (b) the Judge raises the issue of whether the statement was influenced by oppression and informs the prosecution of the grounds for raising the issue.
    
    (2) The Judge must exclude the statement unless satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the statement was not influenced by oppression.
    
    (3) For the purpose of applying this section, it is irrelevant whether or not the statement is true.
    
    (4) Without limiting the matters that a Judge may take into account for the purpose of applying subsection (2), the Judge must, in each case, take into account any of the following matters that are relevant to the case:
        
    *   (a) any pertinent physical, mental, or psychological condition of the defendant when the statement was made (whether apparent or not):

    *   (c) the nature of any questions put to the defendant and the manner and circumstances in which they were put:
    
    *   (d) the nature of any threat, promise, or representation made to the defendant or any other person.
    
    (5) In this section, _oppression_ means---

##### 30 Improperly obtained evidence
    
*   (1) This section applies to a criminal proceeding in which the prosecution offers or proposes to offer evidence if---
        
    *   (a) the defendant or, if applicable, a co-defendant against whom the evidence is offered raises, on the basis of an evidential foundation, the issue of whether the evidence was improperly obtained and informs the prosecution of the grounds for raising the issue; or
    
    *   (b) the Judge raises the issue of whether the evidence was improperly obtained and informs the prosecution of the grounds for raising the issue.
    
    (2) The Judge must---
        
    *   (a) find, on the balance of probabilities, whether or not the evidence was improperly obtained; and
    
    *   (b) if the Judge finds that the evidence has been improperly obtained, determine whether or not the exclusion of the evidence is proportionate to the impropriety by means of a balancing process that gives appropriate weight to the impropriety but also takes proper account of the need for an effective and credible system of justice.
    
    (3) For the purposes of subsection (2), the court may, among any other matters, have regard to the following:
        
    *   (a) the importance of any right breached by the impropriety and the seriousness of the intrusion on it:
    
    *   (b) the nature of the impropriety, in particular, whether it was deliberate, reckless, or done in bad faith:
    
    *   (c) the nature and quality of the improperly obtained evidence:
    
    *   (d) the seriousness of the offence with which the defendant is charged:
    
    *   (e) whether there were any other investigatory techniques not involving any breach of the rights that were known to be available but were not used:
    
    *   (f) whether there are alternative remedies to exclusion of the evidence which can adequately provide redress to the defendant:
    
    *   (g) whether the impropriety was necessary to avoid apprehended physical danger to the Police or others:
    
    *   (h) whether there was any urgency in obtaining the improperly obtained evidence.
    
    (4) The Judge must exclude any improperly obtained evidence if, in accordance with subsection (2), the Judge determines that its exclusion is proportionate to the impropriety.
    
    (5) For the purposes of this section, evidence is _improperly obtained_ if it is obtained---
        
    *   (a) in consequence of a breach of any enactment or rule of law by a person to whom [section 3][293] of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 applies; or
    
    *   (b) in consequence of a statement made by a defendant that is or would be inadmissible if it were offered in evidence by the prosecution; or
    
    *   (c) unfairly.
    
    (6) Without limiting subsection (5)(c), in deciding whether a statement obtained by a member of the Police has been obtained unfairly for the purposes of that provision, the Judge must take into account guidelines set out in practice notes on that subject issued by the Chief Justice.

##### 32 Fact-finder not to be invited to infer guilt from defendant's silence before trial
    
*   (1) This section applies to a criminal proceeding in which it appears that the defendant failed---

    *   (b) to disclose a defence before trial.
    
    (2) If subsection (1) applies,---
        
    *   (a) no person may invite the fact-finder to draw an inference that the defendant is guilty from a failure of the kind described in subsection (1); and
    
    *   (b) if the proceeding is with a jury, the Judge must direct the jury that it may not draw that inference from a failure of that kind.
    
    (3) This section does not apply if the fact that the defendant did not answer a question put, or respond to a statement made, before the trial is a fact required to be proved in the proceeding.

*   (1) A party may not offer evidence in a civil or criminal proceeding about a person's veracity unless the evidence is substantially helpful in assessing that person's veracity.
    
    (2) In a criminal proceeding, evidence about a defendant's veracity must also comply with [section 38][50] or, as the case requires, [section 39][51].
    
    (3) In deciding, for the purposes of subsection (1), whether or not evidence proposed to be offered about the veracity of a person is substantially helpful, the Judge may consider, among any other matters, whether the proposed evidence tends to show 1 or more of the following matters:
        
    *   (a) lack of veracity on the part of the person when under a legal obligation to tell the truth (for example, in an earlier proceeding or in a signed declaration):

    *   (b) the Judge permits the prosecution to do so.
    
    (3) In determining whether to give permission under subsection (2)(b), the Judge may take into account any of the following matters:
        
    *   (a) the extent to which the defendant's veracity or the veracity of a prosecution witness has been put in issue in the defendant's evidence:
    
    *   (b) the time that has elapsed since any conviction about which the prosecution seeks to give evidence:

    *   (b) the Judge in the interests of justice.
    
    (3) A notice must---
        
    *   (a) include the contents of the proposed evidence; and
    
    *   (b) be given in sufficient time to provide all the co-defendants with a fair opportunity to respond to that evidence.
    
    

#### Evidence of propensity

##### 40 Propensity rule
    
*   (1) In this section and [sections 41 to 43][54], _propensity evidence_---
        
    *   (a) means evidence that tends to show a person's propensity to act in a particular way or to have a particular state of mind, being evidence of acts, omissions, events, or circumstances with which a person is alleged to have been involved; but
    
    *   (b) does not include evidence of an act or omission that is---
            
        *   (i) 1 of the elements of the offence for which the person is being tried; or
        
        *   (ii) the cause of action in the proceeding in question.
        
        
    
    (2) A party may offer propensity evidence in a civil or criminal proceeding about any person.
    
    (3) However, propensity evidence about---

    *   (b) a complainant in a sexual case in relation to the complainant's sexual experience may be offered only in accordance with [section 44][58].
    
    (4) Evidence that is solely or mainly relevant to veracity is governed by the veracity rules set out in [section 37][49] and, accordingly, this section does not apply to evidence of that kind.

##### 41 Propensity evidence about defendants
    
*   (1) A defendant in a criminal proceeding may offer propensity evidence about himself or herself.
    
    (2) If a defendant offers propensity evidence about himself or herself, the prosecution or another party may, with the permission of the Judge, offer propensity evidence about that defendant.

    *   (b) the Judge permits the defendant to do so.
    
    (2) A defendant in a criminal proceeding who proposes to offer propensity evidence about a co-defendant must give notice in writing to that co-defendant and every other co-defendant of the proposal to offer that evidence unless the requirement to give notice is waived---
        
    *   (a) by all the co-defendants; or
    
    *   (b) by the Judge in the interests of justice.
    
    (3) A notice must---
        
    *   (a) include the contents of the proposed evidence; and
    
    *   (b) be given in sufficient time to provide all the co-defendants with a fair opportunity to respond to that evidence.
    
    

##### 43 Propensity evidence offered by prosecution about defendants
    
*   (1) The prosecution may offer propensity evidence about a defendant in a criminal proceeding only if the evidence has a probative value in relation to an issue in dispute in the proceeding which outweighs the risk that the evidence may have an unfairly prejudicial effect on the defendant.
    
    (2) When assessing the probative value of propensity evidence, the Judge must take into account the nature of the issue in dispute.
    
    (3) When assessing the probative value of propensity evidence, the Judge may consider, among other matters, the following:
        
    *   (a) the frequency with which the acts, omissions, events, or circumstances which are the subject of the evidence have occurred:
    
    *   (b) the connection in time between the acts, omissions, events, or circumstances which are the subject of the evidence and the acts, omissions, events, or circumstances which constitute the offence for which the defendant is being tried:
    
    *   (c) the extent of the similarity between the acts, omissions, events, or circumstances which are the subject of the evidence and the acts, omissions, events, or circumstances which constitute the offence for which the defendant is being tried:
    
    *   (d) the number of persons making allegations against the defendant that are the same as, or are similar to, the subject of the offence for which the defendant is being tried:
    
    *   (e) whether the allegations described in paragraph (d) may be the result of collusion or suggestibility:
    
    *   (f) the extent to which the acts, omissions, events, or circumstances which are the subject of the evidence and the acts, omissions, events, or circumstances which constitute the offence for which the defendant is being tried are unusual.
    
    (4) When assessing the prejudicial effect of evidence on the defendant, the Judge must consider, among any other matters,---
        
    *   (a) whether the evidence is likely to unfairly predispose the fact-finder against the defendant; and
    
    *   (b) whether the fact-finder will tend to give disproportionate weight in reaching a verdict to evidence of other acts or omissions.
    
    

#### Complainants in sexual cases

##### 44 Evidence of sexual experience of complainants in sexual cases
    
*   (1) In a sexual case, no evidence can be given and no question can be put to a witness relating directly or indirectly to the sexual experience of the complainant with any person other than the defendant, except with the permission of the Judge.
    
    (2) In a sexual case, no evidence can be given and no question can be put to a witness that relates directly or indirectly to the reputation of the complainant in sexual matters.
    
    (3) In an application for permission under subsection (1), the Judge must not grant permission unless satisfied that the evidence or question is of such direct relevance to facts in issue in the proceeding, or the issue of the appropriate sentence, that it would be contrary to the interests of justice to exclude it.
    
    (4) The permission of the Judge is not required to rebut or contradict evidence given under subsection (1).
    
    (5) In a sexual case in which the defendant is charged as a party and cannot be convicted unless it is shown that another person committed a sexual offence against the complainant, subsection (1) does not apply to any evidence given, or any question put, that relates directly or indirectly to the sexual experience of the complainant with that other person.
    
    (6) This section does not authorise evidence to be given or any question to be put that could not be given or put apart from this section.

### Subpart 6---Identification evidence

##### 45 Admissibility of visual identification evidence
    
*   (1) If a formal procedure is followed by officers of an enforcement agency in obtaining visual identification evidence of a person alleged to have committed an offence or there was a good reason for not following a formal procedure, that evidence is admissible in a criminal proceeding unless the defendant proves on the balance of probabilities that the evidence is unreliable.
    
    (2) If a formal procedure is not followed by officers of an enforcement agency in obtaining visual identification evidence of a person alleged to have committed an offence and there was no good reason for not following a formal procedure, that evidence is inadmissible in a criminal proceeding unless the prosecution proves beyond reasonable doubt that the circumstances in which the identification was made have produced a reliable identification.
    
    (3) For the purposes of this section, a _formal procedure_ is a procedure for obtaining visual identification evidence---
        
    *   (a) that is observed as soon as practicable after the alleged offence is reported to an officer of an enforcement agency; and
    
    *   (b) in which the person to be identified is compared to no fewer than 7 other persons who are similar in appearance to the person to be identified; and
    
    *   (c) in which no indication is given to the person making the identification as to who among the persons in the procedure is the person to be identified; and
    
    *   (d) in which the person making the identification is informed that the person to be identified may or may not be among the persons in the procedure; and
    
    *   (e) that is the subject of a written record of the procedure actually followed that is sworn to be true and complete by the officer who conducted the procedure and provided to the Judge and the defendant (but not the jury) at the hearing; and
    
    *   (f) that is the subject of a pictorial record of what the witness looked at that is prepared and certified to be true and complete by the officer who conducted the procedure and provided to the Judge and the defendant (but not the jury) at the hearing; and
    
    *   (g) that complies with any further requirements provided for in regulations made under [section 201][259].
    
    (4) The circumstances referred to in the following paragraphs are _good reasons_ for not following a formal procedure:
        
    *   (a) a refusal of the person to be identified to take part in the procedure (that is, by refusing to take part in a parade or other procedure, or to permit a photograph or video record to be taken, where the enforcement agency does not already have a photo or a video record that shows a true likeness of that person):
    
    *   (b) the singular appearance of the person to be identified (being of a nature that cannot be disguised so that the person is similar in appearance to those with whom the person is to be compared):
    
    *   (c) a substantial change in the appearance of the person to be identified after the alleged offence occurred and before it was practical to hold a formal procedure:
    
    *   (d) no officer involved in the investigation or the prosecution of the alleged offence could reasonably anticipate that identification would be an issue at the trial of the defendant:
    
    *   (e) if an identification of a person alleged to have committed an offence has been made to an officer of an enforcement agency soon after the offence was reported and in the course of that officer's initial investigation:
    
    *   (f) if an identification of a person alleged to have committed an offence has been made to an officer of an enforcement agency after a chance meeting between the person who made the identification and the person alleged to have committed the offence.
    
    

##### 46 Admissibility of voice identification evidence
    
*   Voice identification evidence offered by the prosecution in a criminal proceeding is inadmissible unless the prosecution proves on the balance of probabilities that the circumstances in which the identification was made have produced a reliable identification.

##### 46A Caution regarding reliance on identification evidence
    
*   If evidence of identity is given against the defendant and the defendant disputes that evidence, the court must bear in mind the need for caution before convicting the defendant in reliance on the correctness of any such identification and, in particular, the possibility that the witness may be mistaken.

    Section 46A: inserted, on 1 July 2013, by [section 4][296] of the Evidence Amendment Act 2011 (2011 No 89).

### Subpart 7---Evidence of convictions and civil judgments

##### 47 Conviction as evidence in civil proceedings
    
*   (1) When the fact that a person has committed an offence is relevant to an issue in a civil proceeding, proof that the person has been convicted of that offence is conclusive proof that the person committed the offence.
    
    (2) Despite subsection (1), if the conviction of a person is proved under that subsection, the Judge may, in exceptional circumstances,---
        
    *   (a) permit a party to the proceeding to offer evidence tending to prove that the person convicted did not commit the offence for which the person was convicted; and
    
    *   (b) if satisfied that it is appropriate to do so, direct that the issue whether the person committed the offence be determined without reference to that subsection.
    
    (3) This section applies---
        
    *   (a) whether or not the person convicted is a party to the proceeding; and
    
    *   (b) whether or not the person was convicted on a guilty plea.
    
    (4) This section---
        
    *   (a) is subject to [section 48][65]; and
    
    *   (b) does not affect a provision in any other enactment to the effect that a conviction or a finding of fact in a criminal proceeding is to constitute conclusive evidence for the purposes of any other proceeding.
    
    

##### 48 Conviction as evidence in defamation proceedings
    
*   In a proceeding for defamation that is based on a statement to the effect that a person has committed an offence, proof that the person has been convicted of the offence is conclusive proof that the person committed the offence if the conviction---
        
    *   (a) subsisted at the time that the statement was made; or
    
    *   (b) subsists at the time of the proceeding.
    
    

##### 49 Conviction as evidence in criminal proceedings
