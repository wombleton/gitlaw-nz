## Part 1  
Preliminary provisions

##### 3 Purpose
    
*   (1) The purpose of this Act is to facilitate secure interactions (particularly online interactions) between individuals on the one hand and participating agencies on the other.
    
    (2) To that end, this Act---
        
    *   (a) ensures that participating agencies can achieve a high degree of confidence in an individual's identity by providing the individual with the option of verifying his or her identity authoritatively and in real time by electronic means if a degree of confidence is necessary for the interaction between the participating agency and the individual; and
    
    *   (b) provides for a whole of government shared service to enable a centralised approach to be taken in relation to the verification of an individual's identity by electronic means while protecting the individual's privacy.
    
    

##### 4 Principles
    
*   (1) This Act is based on the following principles:
        
    *   (a) an individual has a complete discretion to decide whether to apply for an electronic identity credential to be issued to him or her and whether to use it at all if it has been issued:
    
    *   (b) an individual may continue to access the services of a participating agency by means other than by using an electronic identity credential even though an electronic identity credential has already been issued to him or her:
    
    *   (c) the use of an electronic identity credential does not, of itself, limit or affect the need for an individual, if required,---
            
        *   (i) to show that he or she is qualified or eligible for a particular service offered by a participating agency; and
        
        *   (ii) to authorise the agency to act on a particular matter or transaction:
        
        
    
    *   (d) an individual's consent to the supply of his or her personal information to a participating agency must be obtained before the Service can supply the information to the agency and, even if the consent is obtained, the Service may supply only the minimum amount of personal information that is necessary for the agency to act as part of a given transaction or a series of transactions:
    
    *   (e) an individual may check whether information held about him or her by the Service is correct and up to date:
    
    *   (f) an individual may view the record of usage history for his or her electronic identity credential:
    
    *   (g) the Service may disclose core identity information contained in electronic identity credentials, photographs, or records of usage history only in accordance with this Act.
    
    (2) The chief executive, the Service, every employee or contractor of the department, and every participating agency must, in making decisions, performing functions or duties, or exercising powers under this Act, take into account the principles specified in subsection (1) that are applicable, so far as is practicable in the circumstances.
    
    (3) Subsections (1) and (2) do not---
        
    *   (a) override any other provision in this Act or any other enactment; or
    
    *   (b) confer on any person any legal right that is enforceable, for example, in a court of law.

    *   (a) the reason for the suspension or revocation; and
    
    *   (b) the date on which and the time at which the suspension or revocation commences; and

#### Identity information checks

##### 3 Conditions for carrying out identity information check
    
*   (1) An agency may carry out an identity information check for the chief executive if---
        
    *   (a) the individual who is or will be the subject of the check has consented (in written or electronic form) to the check before it is carried out; and
    
    *   (b) the chief executive has given the agency an assurance (in written or electronic form) that the individual has consented to the check; and

    (2) For the purposes of subclause (1)(a), an individual may consent to an identity information check on---
        
    *   (a) a one-off basis (that is, for each identity information check); or
    
    *   (b) an ongoing basis (that is, for a series of identity information checks, whether repeated or otherwise).
    
    (3) An individual who consents to an identity information check may withdraw the consent before---
        
    *   (a) the check is carried out, in the case of a consent given on a one-off basis; or
    
    *   (b) all of the checks, or any further checks, are carried out, in the case of a consent given on an ongoing basis.
    
    

##### 4 How identity information check is carried out

    (2) On receiving the individual's identity information, the agency must carry out a search of its database for any recorded information about the individual.
    
    (3) If it is impracticable for the agency to comply with subclause (2) for any reason, the agency must advise the chief executive that the identity information check cannot be carried out and may ask the chief executive to resubmit the individual's identity information.
    
    (4) The agency must not, at any stage, supply to the chief executive any recorded information about the individual who is the subject of the search.
    
    (5) However, subclause (4) does not limit or prevent the disclosure of any information about the status of any recorded information in relation to the individual.
    
    (6) After carrying out the search referred to in subclause (2), the agency must supply to the chief executive information about the search result and, in particular, whether any or all of the individual's identity information submitted to the agency is consistent with any recorded information.
    
    (7) Without limiting subclause (6), the information that may be supplied under that subclause generally includes, subject to subclause (4), one of the following search results:

    Identity information is not consistent with recorded information
    
    Exception

    *   (a) in the same class; or
    
    *   (b) in different classes.
    
    (6) A confirmation agreement may be varied by further agreement between the parties.

    (2) If the chief executive is proposing to enter into a confirmation agreement that will contain terms or conditions that are materially different from the standard terms or conditions developed under subclause (1), the chief executive may develop alternative terms or conditions for the proposed agreement, but must consult the Privacy Commissioner about those terms or conditions before entering into the agreement.
    
    (3) If the chief executive is proposing to vary a confirmation agreement by amending any terms or conditions developed under subclause (1) or (2) that are contained in the agreement, the chief executive must consult the Privacy Commissioner about the proposed amendments to those terms or conditions before varying the agreement.
    
    (4) However, the requirement to consult the Privacy Commissioner under subclause (3) does not apply if the variation relates to---

    *   (b) report on the outcome of the review to the Privacy Commissioner.
    
    (2) If, after a review under subclause (1), the Privacy Commissioner and the chief executive agree that amendments to the terms or conditions of a confirmation agreement are required, the chief executive must vary the confirmation agreement to include the amendments to the terms or conditions.
    
    (3) A variation to a confirmation agreement under subclause (2) applies only if the agency that is party to the agreement agrees to it.

#### Information requirements

##### 9 List of agencies
