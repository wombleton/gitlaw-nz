*   #### Preamble
    
    WHEREAS by a memorandum of transfer and declaration of trust bearing date the twenty-first day of December, one thousand eight hundred and ninety-one, the parcel of land described in the Schedule hereto was vested in certain Trustees in trust for the inhabitants of the Eltham Village Settlement for the purposes of a site for a public hall, and generally upon and subject to the trusts, powers, and provisions set out in the said declaration of trust: And whereas by an order of the High Court (New Plymouth Registry) bearing date the fifteenth day of October, one thousand nine hundred, new Trustees were appointed, and the said piece of land was vested in G W Tayler, C A Wilkinson, E Parrott, W W Stanners, L J Gilbert, James Boddie, and D S Syme (hereinafter referred to as **the Trustees**), who have administered the trust up to the date hereof: And whereas a public hall was erected on the said land by means partly of money publicly subscribed and partly by money provided by the Trustees: And whereas for the purposes of such erection, and generally of the administration of the trust, the Trustees have incurred liabilities amounting to three hundred and fifty dollars: And whereas the said land is no longer suitable for the purposes of the said trust: And whereas the Eltham Village Settlement is now absorbed by and incorporated into the Borough of Eltham: And whereas it is expedient and advisable, in the interests of the public of Eltham, that the said piece of land should be transferred to the Eltham Borough Council, and that the Council should be given such powers of disposition over the same as are hereinafter contained: And whereas the Trustees have agreed with the Eltham Borough Council to sell the said land to the Eltham Borough Council, free from all liabilities, for the sum of three hundred and fifty dollars, conditionally upon the necessary legislative authority in that behalf being obtained:
    
    The words ""three hundred and fifty dollars"" were substituted, as from 10 July 1967, for the words ""one hundred and seventy-five pounds"" pursuant to section [7(1)][10] Decimal Currency Act 1964 (1964 No 27).
