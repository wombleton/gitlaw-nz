    (2) In determining whether to impose or approve a moratorium in relation to an area of the Canterbury region, ECan and the Minister must have regard to---
        
    *   (a) the vision and principles of the CWMS; and

    *   (c) any other relevant matter.

##### 35 Notification of moratorium
    
*   ECan must give public notice and notice in the _Gazette_ of a moratorium, specifying---
        
    *   (a) the area of the Canterbury region to which the moratorium applies; and
    
    *   (b) the date on which it commences; and 
    
    *   (c) the date on which it ends (which must not be later than the day before the resumption day), unless ended sooner under [section 36][50].
    
    

##### 36 Power to end moratorium
    
*   (1) ECan may end a moratorium at any time in any area to which the moratorium relates, or the Minister may direct ECan to end the moratorium.
    
    (2) A moratorium may be ended in relation to a part or the whole of the area to which it applies. 
    
    (3) In determining whether to end, or to direct the end of, a moratorium, ECan or the Minister, as the case may be, must have regard to the adequacy of any relevant regional plan for the area to which the moratorium relates. 
    
    (4) ECan must give public notice and notice in the _Gazette_ of the end of a moratorium, specifying---
        
    *   (a) the area of the Canterbury region to which the moratorium applies; and

    *   (c) the date on which the moratorium will end.
    
    

#### Effect of moratorium

##### 37 Effect of moratorium on specified applications made during currency, or after end, of moratorium
    
*   (1) This section applies to a specified application made to ECan in respect of an area where a moratorium---
        
    *   (a) is in force; or
    
    *   (b) has been in force within 6 months prior to that application being made.
    
    (2) If the specified application is made while a moratorium is in force, ECan----
        
    *   (a) must not begin to process the application; and
    
    *   (b) must return the application and any fee accompanying it to the applicant as soon as practicable.
    
    (3) If the specified application is made at any time during the period that ends 6 months after the end of a moratorium, ECan must not begin to process the application until after the end of that period.

##### 38 Specified applications made before moratorium in force
    
*   (1) In the case of specified applications made to ECan before a moratorium comes into force in respect of the area to which the application relates, ECan must not continue to process or determine an application any earlier than the end of the period that ends 6 months after the end of the moratorium.
    
    (2) However, ECan must continue to process and determine a specified application as if there were no moratorium in force if, before a moratorium comes into force, ECan has decided in respect of the application that---
        
    *   (a) a hearing must be held and the hearing has commenced or been completed; or
    
    *   (b) no hearing is required.
    
    

##### 39 Effect of moratorium on applications for which request is made under section 87D of RMA
    
*   (1) This section applies if, before a moratorium is in force in an area to which a specified application relates, the applicant requests ECan under [section 87D][134] of the RMA to allow the application to be determined by the Environment Court instead of by ECan. 
    
    (2) The specified application is to be treated as one to which [section 38(1)][53] applies if, before a moratorium comes into force, ECan---
        
    *   (a) declines the request; or
    
    *   (b) has not made a decision on the request.
    
    (3) However, if ECan decides under [section 87E][135] of the RMA to grant a request before a moratorium comes into force, the moratorium is of no effect in respect of the specified application to which the request relates, unless subsection (4) applies.
    
    (4) If [section 87I][136] of the RMA applies, the specified application must be treated as an application to which [section 38(1)][53] applies.

##### 40 Effect of moratorium on permits granted before moratorium in force
    
*   (1) Subsection (2) applies if a permit---
        
    *   (a) has been granted (whether before or after the commencement day) in relation to an area of the Canterbury region where a moratorium subsequently comes into force; and
    
    *   (b) is due to expire during, or within 6 months after the end of, the moratorium.
    
    (2) The permit is to be treated as expiring on the date that is 6 months after the end of the moratorium.

#### Treatment of specified applications at end of moratorium

##### 41 Specified applications held over during moratorium may be revised
    
*   (1) If the processing of a specified application is interrupted under [section 38(1)][53] during a moratorium, the applicant may, in the period commencing with the end of the moratorium and ending 6 months later,---
        
    *   (a) revise the application to take account of any changes made to the relevant regional plan since the application was first made; and
    
    *   (b) lodge any revised application again with ECan. 
    
    (2) Not later than 5 working days before the end of a moratorium, ECan must give notice to any applicant whose application is affected in the manner referred to in subsection (1), advising the applicant---
        
    *   (a) of the date on which the moratorium will end; and
    
    *   (b) of the applicant's right to revise the application and lodge it again with ECan. 
    
    (3) Subsection (1)(a) permits revision of a specified application only if, and to the extent that, the application---
        
    *   (a) is revised no more than is necessary to take into account changes made to the relevant regional plan since the application was first lodged; and
    
    *   (b) remains within the scope of the application as it was first lodged.
    
    

##### 42 Process to apply to specified applications after end of moratorium
    
*   (1) On the day that is 6 months after the end of a moratorium, ECan must---
        
    *   (a) resume processing any specified applications to which [section 38(1)][53] applies, including any applications revised and lodged again as permitted by [section 41(1) and (3)][57]; and
    
    *   (b) process those applications---
            
        *   (i) as having been received on the date that the original application was first lodged; but
        
        *   (ii) under any relevant regional plan applying at the time when the application is considered. 
        
        
    
    (2) On the day that is 6 months after the end of a moratorium, ECan must commence processing, in accordance with subsection (3), any specified application to which---
        
    *   (a) [section 37(3) ][52] applies; or
    
    *   (b) [section 38(1)][53] applies, if the application has been revised, but not in accordance with [section 41(3)][57].
    
    (3) ECan must process an application to which subsection (2) applies--- 
        
    *   (a) as if it were a new application made---
            
        *   (i) on the day it was first lodged, in the case of an application to which subsection (2)(a) refers:
        
        *   (ii) on the day it was lodged again, in the case of an application to which subsection (2)(b) refers; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) under any relevant regional plan applying at the time when the application is considered.
    
    (4) Subsections (1)(b)(ii) and (3)(b) apply instead of [section 88A][137] of the RMA.

##### 43 Application of certain provisions of RMA
    
*   (1) [Section 124(3)][138] of the RMA applies to a permit that is extended by the operation of [section 40][55], but only if the holder of the permit applies to ECan for a new permit---
        
    *   (a) for the same activity; and
    
    *   (b) on or before the day that the existing permit expires under [section 40(2)][55].
    
    (2) If a specified application is made in the circumstances described in subsection (1),---
        
    *   (a) for the purposes of [sections 124A to 124C][139] of the RMA, the application is one that is affected by [section 124][138] of that Act; and
    
    *   (b) the references in [section 124C(4) and (5)][140] to an application being made more than 3 months before the expiry of the consent must be read as a reference to an application being made on or before the day that the permit is to be treated as expiring under [section 40(2)][55].

## Schedule 1   
Vision and principles of Canterbury Water Management Strategy---Strategic Framework, November 2009

[ss 4][5], [6][7], [34][48], [50][70], [63][85]

## Part 1  
Vision and principles

##### Vision

To enable present and future generations to gain the greatest social, economic, recreational and cultural benefits from our water resources within an environmentally sustainable framework.

#### Fundamental principles 

##### Primary principles

##### 1 Sustainable management

Water is a public resource which must be managed in accordance with sustainability principles and be consistent with the Resource Management and Local Government Acts.

##### 2 Regional approach

*   The planning of natural water use is guided by the following:
        
    *   first order priority considerations: the environment, customary uses, community supplies and stock water
    *   second order priority considerations: irrigation, renewable electricity generation, recreation, tourism and amenity
    
*   A consistent regulatory approach to water is applied throughout the Canterbury region, recognising these principles
*   Both surface and groundwater are given equal importance
*   Further development of scientific knowledge of the region's water resources and the impacts of climate change are given priority
*   The actual or potential cumulative effects the taking and using water can have on waterways are recognised and managed within defined standards
*   A cautious approach is taken when information is uncertain, unreliable, or inadequate
*   The need for efficient use of water in existing and new infrastructure is recognised
*   There is strong emphasis on the integration of water and land management including protection of indigenous biodiversity and enhancement of water quality
*   Current and potential effects of land use intensification is an integral part of decision-making on water takes. This may mean amending regional and district plans.

##### 3 Kaitiakitanga

*   The exercise of kaitiakitanga by Ngai Tahu applies to all water and lakes, rivers, hapua, waterways and wetlands, and shall be carried out in accordance with tikanga Maori.

##### Supporting principles

##### 4 Natural character

The natural character (mauri[1][173]) of Canterbury's rivers, streams, lakes, groundwater and wetlands is preserved and enhanced:
    
*   natural flow regimes of rivers are maintained and, where they have been adversely affected by takes, enhanced where possible
*   the dynamic processes of Canterbury's braided rivers define their character and are protected
*   environmental flow regimes are established for every waterway where abstraction occurs
*   that restoration of natural character and biodiversity, is a priority for degraded waterways, particularly lowland streams and lowland catchments
*   the interdependence of waterways and coastal ecosystems is recognised.

##### 5 Indigenous biodiversity

*   Indigenous flora and fauna and their habitats in rivers, streams, lakes, groundwater and wetlands are protected and valued.
*   The aims of the Canterbury Biodiversity Strategy are recognised and supported.

##### 6 Access

*   Public access to and along rivers, lakes, waterways and wetlands is maintained and, where appropriate, enhanced. Access may need to be limited in situations including where environmental risk, public safety, security of assets, cultural values, biodiversity and farm management require.

##### 7 Quality drinking water

*   All those living in Canterbury have access to high quality drinking water:
*   The region's high quality aquifer-sourced drinking water is protected.
*   Where Canterbury's drinking water is currently untreated and safe for drinking, it is maintained at that high standard.

##### 8 Recreational and amenity opportunities

*   Rivers, lakes, groundwater and wetlands provide opportunities for enjoyment, recreation and tourism:
*   High quality water ensures contact recreation such as swimming, fishing, boating and other water sports are able to be enjoyed throughout Canterbury.
*   Adequate environmental flows should ensure that recreational users and tourists can enjoy Canterbury rivers.
*   Eco-tourism opportunities are recognised and encouraged.

##### 9 Community and commercial use

Water resources are used sustainably to enhance quality of life:
    
*   where water is abstracted, it is used effectively and efficiently:
*   land use, industry, and business practices to not adversely impact on natural water quality:
*   discharges to waterways are minimised and do not compromise quality:
*   land use practices are monitored and best practice approaches are required:
*   agricultural stock is excluded from all waterways in catchments where irrigated farming is practised and all lowland streams:
*   where acclimatised wildlife in lowland streams cause contamination, they are appropriately managed:
*   degraded waahi taonga are enhanced to restore tangata whenua cultural wellbeing.

## Part 2  
Status and preparation of Canterbury Water Management Strategy---Strategic Framework November 2009

*   1 The vision and principles of the CWMS, as set out in Part 1, are reproduced from the Canterbury Water Management Strategy---Strategic Framework, November 2009 (CWMS).

*   2 The preparation of the CWMS was supervised by a multi-stakeholder Steering Group under the overall leadership of the Canterbury Mayoral Forum.

*   3 The membership of the Canterbury Mayoral Forum and of the Steering Group is set out in Annex A of the CWMS.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Environment Canterbury (Temporary Commissioners and Improved Water Management) Act 2010\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 5 March 2013, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][176] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][177] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][178] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][179] and [17E][180] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
