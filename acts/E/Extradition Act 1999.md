*   (1) In this Act, _extradition offence_ means, subject to an extradition treaty,---

    *   (b) in relation to a request by New Zealand, an offence punishable under the law of New Zealand for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for not less than 12 months or any more severe penalty.
    
    (2) The condition referred to in subsection (1)(a) is that if the conduct of the person constituting the offence in relation to the extradition country, or equivalent conduct, had occurred within the jurisdiction of New Zealand at the relevant time it would, if proved, have constituted an offence punishable under the law of New Zealand for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for not less than 12 months or any more severe penalty.
    
    (3) For the purposes of determining whether the condition in subsection (2) is satisfied in relation to a particular application for surrender of a person, the relevant time referred to in subsection (2) is the time at which the conduct is alleged to have occurred.
    
    (4) In determining the maximum penalty for an offence against the law of any foreign country for which no statutory penalty is imposed, regard must be had to the level of penalty that can be imposed by a court for the offence.

##### 5 Interpretation provisions relating to offences
    
*   (1) A reference in this Act to _conduct constituting an offence_ is a reference to the acts or omissions, or both, by virtue of which the offence has, or is alleged to have, been committed.
    
    (2) In making a determination for the purposes of [section 4(2)][7], the totality of the acts or omissions alleged to have been committed by the person must be taken into account and it does not matter whether under the law of the extradition country and New Zealand---
        
    *   (a) the acts or omissions are categorised or named differently; or
    
    *   (b) the constituent elements of the offence differ.
    
    (3) An offence may be an extradition offence although---
        
    *   (a) it is an offence against a law of the extradition country relating to revenue (including taxation and customs and excise duties) or foreign exchange controls; and
    
    *   (b) New Zealand does not impose a tax, duty, or other impost of that kind.
    
    (4) For the purposes of this Act, any vessel or aircraft recognised by the law of any country as belonging to that country is deemed to be within the jurisdiction of and to be part of that country.
    
    (5) If a person has been convicted in his or her absence of an offence against the law of an extradition country, whether or not the conviction is a final conviction, then, for the purposes of this Act, the person is deemed not to have been convicted of that offence but is deemed to have been accused of that offence.

    *   (c) on surrender, the person may be prejudiced at his or her trial or punished, detained, or restricted in his or her personal liberty by reason of his or her race, ethnic origin, religion, nationality, sex, or other status, or political opinions; or
    
    *   (d) the conduct for which the surrender is sought would have constituted an offence under military law only and not an offence under the ordinary criminal law of the extradition country; or
    
    *   (e) the person has been acquitted or pardoned by a competent tribunal or authority in the extradition country or New Zealand, or has undergone the punishment provided by the law of that country or New Zealand, in respect of the extradition offence or another offence constituted by the same conduct as constitutes the extradition offence; or
