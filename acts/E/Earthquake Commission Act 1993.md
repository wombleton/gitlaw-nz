No acts done or caused to be done by the Commission with a view to replacement or reinstatement shall be deemed to be an election by the Commission to replace or reinstate.

##### 10 Relocation of building
    
*   (1) Instead of paying the amount of any natural disaster damage to, or reinstating, a residential building or residential land, the Commission may, at its option, relocate the building concerned on the same site or, where that site is unsuitable because of damage which it has suffered or is likely to suffer, to a different site determined by the Commission, being a site that is reasonably equivalent in all material respects to the existing site immediately before the damage occurred.
    
    (2) If the Commission elects to relocate a residential building, it shall---
        
    *   (a) pay all costs of relocation; and
    
    *   (b) reinstate the building to the same condition as the building was in immediately before the natural disaster damage occurred, except that the Commission shall not be bound to reinstate exactly or completely, but only as circumstances permit and in a reasonably sufficient manner; and
    
    *   (c) where the building is moved to a different site, provide the insured person with a legal right or interest in the different site of the same kind as the right or interest that the insured person had in the previous site; and, upon provision to him or her of this right or interest, the insured person shall transfer to the Commission his or her right or interest in the previous site.
    
    

##### 11 Subrogation of rights
    
*   The insured person shall at the expense of the Commission, and whether before or after the Commission settles any claim under this Act, do and permit to be done all such acts and things as may be necessary or reasonably required by the Commission for the purpose of enforcing any rights and remedies, or of obtaining any relief or indemnity from other persons, to which the Commission is or would upon its settling any such claim be entitled or subrogated.

##### 12 Mitigation
    
*   The insured person shall at all times take reasonable precautions for the safety of the insured property, having regard to its nature; and, in particular, if at any time any part of the insured property or any premises in which any part of the insured property is situated suffer natural disaster damage, the insured person shall take all reasonable steps to preserve the insured property from further natural disaster damage or from natural disaster damage, as the case may be.

##### 13 Amount payable for claims
    
*   (1) Where any claim is made under this Act in respect of natural disaster damage to any property and, because of circumstances relating to the cause of the damage, the claim cannot be settled promptly, the Commission may in its discretion settle the claim on the basis of the value of the property at the time of the settlement of the claim notwithstanding the fact that the value is higher than the value at the time the natural disaster damage occurred.
    
    (2) Subject to subclause (1), the Commission may settle any claim under this Act on the basis of the amount it would have cost to replace or reinstate the property at the time of the occurrence of the natural disaster damage to the property.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Earthquake Commission Act 1993\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 July 2013, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][85] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][86] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][87] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][88] and [17E][89] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
