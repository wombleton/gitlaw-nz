    *   (c) the amount (if any) prescribed under [section 4D][11] for a student receiving tuition at a State school in the subject, course, or programme:
    
    *   (d) all other fees (if any) prescribed by the board.
    
    (2) Nothing in subsection (1) prevents a board's accepting by instalments any amount required by that subsection to be paid; but subject to [section 4(8)][7], no international student shall at any time continue to receive tuition in any subject, course, or programme at a State school unless the sum of the following amounts is less than the sum of the instalments paid up to that time:

    (4) In any year, the amount of any grant for a board in respect of a school it administers may be reduced from what it would otherwise have been by any amount by which (in the Secretary's opinion), by virtue of the fact that the full amount required by subsection (1) in respect of a subject, course, or programme at the school in which an international student was enrolled has not been paid to the board, the student's education has been subsidised by money appropriated by Parliament.
    
    (5) No grant shall be reduced under subsection (4) unless the Secretary has given the board concerned written notice of the circumstances taken into account when the proposed reduction was decided on.

    *   (d) the arbitrator's decision is final.
    
    (7) Where at any time an international student withdraws from a subject, course, or programme at a State school, the board may refund to the person who paid (in respect of the student's enrolment in the subject, course, or programme) the amount of the fees referred to in subsection (1) (or the sum of any instalments paid in respect of those fees) any amount it thinks appropriate not exceeding the extent (if any) by which the amount paid exceeds the sum of the following amounts:
        
    *   (a) the board's best estimate of the cost to the board (including the appropriate proportion of the board's administrative and other general costs and the appropriate proportion of any initial or start-up costs of the subject, course, or programme) of providing tuition in the subject, course, or programme for 1 student up to that time:
    
    *   (b) an amount that is in the board's opinion an appropriate reflection of the use made by 1 student receiving tuition in the subject, course, or programme of the board's capital facilities:
    
    *   (c) the appropriate proportion of the amount (if any) prescribed under [section 4D][11] for a student receiving tuition at a State school in the subject, course, or programme:

##### 14 Principal may stand-down or suspend students

    *   (a) the student's gross misconduct or continual disobedience is a harmful or dangerous example to other students at the school; or
    
    *   (b) because of the student's behaviour, it is likely that the student, or other students at the school, will be seriously harmed if the student is not stood-down or suspended.
    
    (2) A stand-down may be for 1 or more specified periods, and---
        
    *   (a) the period or periods may not exceed 5 school days in any one term:
    
    *   (b) a student may be stood-down more than once in the same year but for not more than 10 school days in total in that year:

        *   (i) the cost to the institution (including the institution's marginal administrative and other general costs, and the appropriate portion of any initial or start-up costs of the programme) of providing tuition in the programme for 1 student, in the case of a programme in which no domestic student is enrolled:

    *   (b) an amount fixed by the council that is not less than an amount that in the council's opinion is an appropriate reflection of the use by 1 student receiving tuition in the programme of the capital facilities (if any) whose provision at the institution is necessary by virtue only of the institution's provision of tuition to international students in addition to domestic students; and
    
    *   (c) all other fees (if any) prescribed by the council.
    
    (2A) Notwithstanding subsection (2), a council may accept from an international student in respect of any programme of study or training at an institution an amount that is less than the sum of the amounts referred to in that subsection by an amount that is no greater than the sum of---

    (4) In any year, the amount of any grant for an institution may be reduced from what it would otherwise have been by any amount by which (in the Secretary's opinion), by virtue of the fact that the full amount required by subsection (2)(a) in respect of a programme of study or training at the institution in which an international student was enrolled has not been paid to the institution, the student's education has been subsidised by public money appropriated by Parliament.
    
    (5) No grant shall be reduced under subsection (4) unless the Secretary has given to the council of the institution written notice of the circumstances taken into account when the proposed reduction was decided on.

    *   (c) if, within 14 days of getting the council's notice, the Secretary has not agreed an arbitrator with the council, an arbitrator appointed jointly by the Secretary and by the arbitrator originally proposed by the council shall settle the dispute:
    
    *   (d) the arbitrator's decision is final.
    
    (7) The council of an institution shall---
        
    *   (a) when an international student enrols, or resumes attendance, at the institution, give to the Secretary written notice (to the best of the council's knowledge) of the student's name, nationality, and programme of study or training:
    
    *   (b) when an international student ceases to be enrolled at, or ceases to attend, the institution, notify the Secretary in writing:
    
    *   (c) comply with all accounting requirements relating to international students enrolled at institutions contained in any notice published by the Minister in the _Gazette_ that is for the time being in force.
    
    (8) The council of an institution shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that when a student enrols at the institution (whether for the first time or for a subsequent time) the student is given written notice of the circumstances (if any) in which the student is or may be entitled to a refund of all or any part of fees under this section paid or to be paid to the council.
    
    (9) The power of a council to refund to a student all or any part of any fees paid to it under this section is not limited or affected by---
        
    *   (a) any failure to comply with subsection (8); or
    
    *   (b) the fact that the circumstances fall outside those notified under that subsection; or
    
    *   (c) the fact that the refund is larger than a notice under that subsection provides for.

    (2) In this clause, **natural person act**---

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Education Act 1989\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 13 June 2013, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][1876] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][1877] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][1878] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][1879] and [17E][1880] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
