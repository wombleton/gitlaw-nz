    *   (c) the amount (if any) prescribed under [section 4D][11] for a student receiving tuition at a State school in the subject, course, or programme:
    
    *   (d) all other fees (if any) prescribed by the board.

    (4) In any year, the amount of any grant for a board in respect of a school it administers may be reduced from what it would otherwise have been by any amount by which (in the Secretary's opinion), by virtue of the fact that the full amount required by subsection (1) in respect of a subject, course, or programme at the school in which an international student was enrolled has not been paid to the board, the student's education has been subsidised by money appropriated by Parliament.
    
    (5) No grant shall be reduced under subsection (4) unless the Secretary has given the board concerned written notice of the circumstances taken into account when the proposed reduction was decided on.

    *   (a) the board's best estimate of the cost to the board (including the appropriate proportion of the board's administrative and other general costs and the appropriate proportion of any initial or start-up costs of the subject, course, or programme) of providing tuition in the subject, course, or programme for 1 student up to that time:
    
    *   (b) an amount that is in the board's opinion an appropriate reflection of the use made by 1 student receiving tuition in the subject, course, or programme of the board's capital facilities:
    
    *   (c) the appropriate proportion of the amount (if any) prescribed under [section 4D][11] for a student receiving tuition at a State school in the subject, course, or programme:

    (6) If the board's decision under subsection (2) is made within 18 months after an election in an election year, the board must decide which of its parent representatives will stand down at the mid-term election; and that decision must be by consensus of the parent representatives or, if consensus cannot be reached, by ballot of all the parent representatives.
    
    (7) Every parent representative who, in accordance with subsection (6), is to stand down at a mid-term election, goes out of office at the close of the day before the day on which the successor takes office following the election.

    *   (a) an amount fixed by the council that is not less than the council's best estimate of---
            
        *   (i) the cost to the institution (including the institution's marginal administrative and other general costs, and the appropriate portion of any initial or start-up costs of the programme) of providing tuition in the programme for 1 student, in the case of a programme in which no domestic student is enrolled:
        
        *   (ii) the marginal cost to the institution (including the institution's marginal administrative and other general costs, and any marginal initial or start-up costs of the programme) of providing tuition in the programme for 1 student in addition to the domestic students receiving tuition in the programme, in every other case; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) an amount fixed by the council that is not less than an amount that in the council's opinion is an appropriate reflection of the use by 1 student receiving tuition in the programme of the capital facilities (if any) whose provision at the institution is necessary by virtue only of the institution's provision of tuition to international students in addition to domestic students; and
    
    *   (c) all other fees (if any) prescribed by the council.
    
    (2A) Notwithstanding subsection (2), a council may accept from an international student in respect of any programme of study or training at an institution an amount that is less than the sum of the amounts referred to in that subsection by an amount that is no greater than the sum of---
        
    *   (a) any amounts by which the council has decided to subsidise the student in respect of the programme; and
    
    *   (b) the appropriate proportion of any amounts by which the council has decided to subsidise the student in respect of programmes of a kind or description that include the programme; and

    (2B) Nothing in subsection (2) prevents a council's accepting by instalments any fee required by that subsection to be paid.

    (4) In any year, the amount of any grant for an institution may be reduced from what it would otherwise have been by any amount by which (in the Secretary's opinion), by virtue of the fact that the full amount required by subsection (2)(a) in respect of a programme of study or training at the institution in which an international student was enrolled has not been paid to the institution, the student's education has been subsidised by public money appropriated by Parliament.
    
    (5) No grant shall be reduced under subsection (4) unless the Secretary has given to the council of the institution written notice of the circumstances taken into account when the proposed reduction was decided on.
    
    (6) Where the council of an institution disputes that a grant should be reduced under subsection (4), or disputes the amount by which it should so be reduced, the following provisions apply:

    *   (c) if, within 14 days of getting the council's notice, the Secretary has not agreed an arbitrator with the council, an arbitrator appointed jointly by the Secretary and by the arbitrator originally proposed by the council shall settle the dispute:
    
    *   (d) the arbitrator's decision is final.
    
    (7) The council of an institution shall---
        
    *   (a) when an international student enrols, or resumes attendance, at the institution, give to the Secretary written notice (to the best of the council's knowledge) of the student's name, nationality, and programme of study or training:
    
    *   (b) when an international student ceases to be enrolled at, or ceases to attend, the institution, notify the Secretary in writing:
    
    *   (c) comply with all accounting requirements relating to international students enrolled at institutions contained in any notice published by the Minister in the _Gazette_ that is for the time being in force.
    
    (8) The council of an institution shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that when a student enrols at the institution (whether for the first time or for a subsequent time) the student is given written notice of the circumstances (if any) in which the student is or may be entitled to a refund of all or any part of fees under this section paid or to be paid to the council.
    
    (9) The power of a council to refund to a student all or any part of any fees paid to it under this section is not limited or affected by---
        
    *   (a) any failure to comply with subsection (8); or
    
    *   (b) the fact that the circumstances fall outside those notified under that subsection; or
    
    *   (c) the fact that the refund is larger than a notice under that subsection provides for.

    (3B) The rates of student allowances set under this section (except the rates of allowances provided in respect of accommodation expenses) must be adjusted, by regulations made under subsection (1), as at 1 April each year so that in each case the new rate (after the deduction of standard tax) is the rate at that date (after the deduction of standard tax and before the adjustment under this section is made) adjusted by an amount equal to the percentage movement upwards in the CPI between the CPI for the quarter ended with 31 December 1 year before the immediately preceding 31 December and the CPI for the quarter ended with the immediately preceding 31 December.

    (3D) An adjustment under subsection (3B) must not reduce the weekly amounts of student allowances payable.
    
    (3E) Every adjustment made under subsection (3B) comes into force, or is considered to have come into force, on 1 April of the calendar year in which it is made, and applies to student allowances payable on and after that date.
    
    (3F) In this section,---
    
    _CPI_ means the consumers price index-all groups published by Statistics New Zealand
    
    _standard tax_ means the amount of tax reckoned on a weekly basis that would be withholdable in accordance with tax code ""M"" stated in [section 24B][1684] of the Tax Administration Act 1994\.
    
    (4) The power to make regulations under subsection (1) includes (and is deemed always to have included) power to make regulations---
        
    *   (a) authorising the Secretary, for the purposes of assessing the eligibility of any person for an allowance, to take into account the income of that person's parents or spouse or partner:
