An Act---
    
*   (a) to provide for the integration of employment services and income support services; and

*   (b) to facilitate the transfer of the administration of the Social Security Act 1964 and of functions under certain other enactments; and

*   (c) to amend related enactments and to provide for related matters

##### 1 Short Title and commencement
    
*   (1) This Act may be cited as the Employment Services and Income Support (Integrated Administration) Act 1998\.
    
    (2) This Act comes into force on 1 October 1998\.

##### 2 Interpretation
    
*   In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,---
    
    _chief executive_ means, subject to any enactment, the chief executive of the department that is, with the authority of the Prime Minister, for the time being responsible for the administration of the [Social Security Act 1964][15]
    
    _responsible department_ means the department that is, with the authority of the Prime Minister, for the time being responsible for the administration of the [Social Security Act 1964][15]
    
    _responsible Minister_, in relation to any provisions of the [Social Security Act 1964][15], means, subject to any enactment, the Minister who is, with the authority of the Prime Minister, for the time being responsible for the administration of those provisions.

##### 3 Application of employment contracts
    
*   (1) This section and [section 4][5] apply to any employee of the Department of Social Welfare or Department of Labour who transfers (in circumstances to which [section 61A][16] of the State Sector Act 1988 applies) to the responsible department (which employee is, in this section and in section 4, a _transferred employee_).
    
    (2) Unless a transferred employee's employment contract otherwise provides and subject to subsection (3), the transferred employee's employment contract continues to apply to that employee, on and from the date the employee transfers to the responsible department, on the same terms and conditions (including the period of the contract)---
        
    *   (a) as if it were a contract that had been made in respect of the responsible department; and
    
    *   (b) as if it were binding on both that employee and on the chief executive of the responsible department, and on any other party to that contract.
    
    (3) If there is a change to an employee's duties or location arising out of his or her transfer to the responsible department, the conditions of employment of that employee may be varied by agreement to reflect that change but the conditions of employment (as so varied) must be no less favourable than those that the employee was entitled to receive under the employment contract applying to the employee at the date of the transfer.
    
    (4) Subsections (2) and (3) continue to apply to the conditions of employment of each transferred employee to whom this section applies until such time as any of the conditions of employment that apply under the employment contract applying to that employee at the date of the transfer are subsequently varied (otherwise than for the purpose referred to in subsection (3)).
    
    (5) The conditions of employment of each such transferred employee are, on and from the date of any subsequent variation referred to in subsection (4), to be determined in accordance with the employment contract applying to that employee in the responsible department.
    
    (6) Nothing in subsection (2) or subsection (3) continues to apply to any transferred employee who receives any subsequent appointment, whether within the responsible department or any other department.

##### 4 Employment to be continuous
    
*   For the purposes of any provisions of a transferred employee's employment contract relating to continuity of service, that employee's transfer from the Department of Social Welfare or Department of Labour to the responsible department is insufficient by itself to break his or her employment.

##### 5 Transfer not sufficient to entitle employee to redundancy or severance payment
    
*   No employee of the Department of Social Welfare or the Department of Labour who is transferred to the responsible department (in circumstances to which [section 61A][16] of the State Sector Act 1988 applies) is entitled to receive any compensation for redundancy or any severance payment because---
        
    *   (a) the position held by that employee in the Department of Social Welfare or the Department of Labour has ceased to exist; or
    
    *   (b) he or she has ceased by virtue of that transfer to be an employee of the Department of Social Welfare or the Department of Labour.
    
    

##### 6 Transfers of contracts and leases not to give rise to claims
    
*   (1) No person has any claim against the Crown for breach of any contract merely because the administration of the contract or the benefit of the contract is transferred (in whole or in part) to the responsible department, whether or not the person has agreed to the transfer.
    
    (2) Subsection (1) applies whether or not the transfer involves the responsible department and its employees gaining access to any information, data, programme, intellectual property right, know-how, chattel, equipment, transmission device, or facility of the claimant or any other person.
    
    (3) No person has any claim against the Crown for breach of any lease of any premises which are to be occupied or administered (in whole or in part) by the responsible department merely because of that occupation or administration of the premises by the responsible department, whether or not the person has agreed to the occupation or administration of the premises.

##### 7 Continuation of existing proceedings
    
*   (1) If, before the commencement of this Act, the Minister of Social Welfare has, in his or her capacity as the Minister responsible for the administration of the [Social Security Act 1964][15], initiated or become a party to any proceedings, the proceedings may be continued, completed, and enforced by or against the responsible Minister.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Employment Services and Income Support (Integrated Administration) Act 1998\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 October 1999, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][68] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][69] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][70] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][71] and [17E][72] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
