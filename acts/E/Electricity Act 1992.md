##### 24A Criteria for setting reasonable conditions
    
*   (1) In setting, varying, or revoking reasonable conditions under [section 24(2)][42], the local authority or other body or person having jurisdiction over the road concerned may consider all or any of the following matters:
        
    *   (a) the safe and efficient flow of traffic (whether pedestrian or vehicular):
    
    *   (b) the health and safety of any person who is, or class of persons who are, likely to be directly affected by the work on the road:
    
    *   (c) the need to lessen the damage that is likely to be caused to property (including structural integrity of the roads) as a result of work on the road:
    
    *   (d) the compensation that may be payable under [section 57][80] for property that is likely to be damaged as a result of work on the road:
    
    *   (e) the need to lessen disruption to the local community (including businesses):
    
    *   (f) the co-ordination of installation of other networks:
    
    *   (g) the co-ordination with road construction work by the local authority or other body or person who has jurisdiction over that road:
    
    *   (h) the need of the electricity operator to establish an electricity network in a timely manner.
    
    (2) Nothing in subsection (1) limits a local authority's or other body's or person's ability to impose reasonable conditions under [section 24(2)][42].
    
    (3) However, a condition requiring a network operator to increase amenity values (rather than to merely maintain them) must not be imposed unless the work to be done is in an area identified in a district plan as an area in relation to which, under the district plan, there are particular considerations, or rules or requirements, relating to amenity values.
    
    (4) If the cost to the network operator of complying with a condition referred to in subsection (3) is higher than it would have been if there were not a requirement to increase amenity values, then the person imposing the condition must pay that increase in cost.

    *   (a) the local authority or other body or person having jurisdiction over the road to which the work relates; and
    
    *   (b) the owner of any pipe, telecommunications line, or works that are constructed in, on, along, over, across, or under that road and that will be affected, or are likely to be affected, by the work.
    
    (2) Every such notice shall be in writing, and shall specify the location of the proposed work, the nature of the work to be undertaken, and the reasons for it.
    
    (3) Within 15 working days after the receipt of the written notice of the intention to undertake work, the persons who are given a notice pursuant to subsection (1) shall notify the electricity operator, in writing, of any conditions imposed pursuant to [section 24(2)][42].
    
    (4) Where a person who is given a notice pursuant to subsection (1) fails to notify the electricity operator of the conditions imposed pursuant to [section 24(2)][42] within the period referred to in subsection (3) of this section, no such conditions may be imposed, and the electricity operator may commence work.
    
    (5) Where any such work is rendered urgent and necessary by any defective equipment, or other emergency, the electricity operator shall be excused from complying with the requirements of subsection (1) before commencing the work, but shall give the information required by subsection (2) as soon as practicable thereafter.

    *   (a) an electricity operator wishes to enter upon any level crossing for the purpose of constructing or maintaining any works in, on, along, over, across, or under that level crossing; and
    
    *   (b) after taking all reasonable steps to do so, the electricity operator has been unable to negotiate an agreement for entry,---
    
    the electricity operator may, upon giving the owner and occupier of the level crossing not less than 10 working days' notice of its intention to do so, apply to a District Court for an order under this section.
