It being desirable to change the purpose of a recreation-reserve at Ormond to a site for a school, another more suitable recreation-ground having been provided in the district, special legislation is required, owing to the provisions of The Public Reserves Act 1881\.9\.

The Native Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives have reported on the case as follows:---

> "That Mr Worker paid his money away under a mistaken impression. The land passed through the Court in 1869, and the certificate of title was issued in 1870\. In 1872 Government began to purchase, and completed the transaction for two-thirds of the block in 1880\. The case is a hard one, as Mr Worker was evidently a _bona fide_ settler. The Committee recommends Government to consider whether, under the Special Powers and Contracts Bill, or by means of putting up the land for sale, with a reserve for cost and improvements, redress could be found for an evident hardship."


15\. May issue a Crown grant to the Rev William Worker for the two pieces of land in question, on payment of the sum of $340 (being the balance of $1 per acre for the estimated area, 600 acres), subject, nevertheless, to a proportionate increase or reduction after the actual area has been ascertained by survey.
