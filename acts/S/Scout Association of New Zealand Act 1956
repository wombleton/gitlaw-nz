*   #### Preamble
    
    Whereas there was incorporated in Great Britain by Royal Charter dated 4 January 1912 a body corporate known as the Boy Scouts Association:
    
    And whereas the Boy Scouts Association was the outcome of the movement initiated in Great Britain by the late Lord Baden Powell of Gilwell, OM, GCMG, GCVO, KCB, for the special training and instruction of boys in accordance with the principles and under the organisation from time to time laid down in the constitution and in the Policy Organisation and Rules of the Boy Scouts Association:
    
    And whereas the aforesaid movement has spread throughout the British Commonwealth of Nations and elsewhere, and there has for many years past existed in New Zealand an organisation for the training of boys on the lines and in harmony with the principles of the aforementioned constitution and the Policy Organisation and Rules of the Boy Scouts Association and working as a branch of and in close co-operation with the Boy Scouts Association:
    
    And whereas the New Zealand Branch was incorporated by the Boy Scouts Association (New Zealand Branch) Incorporation Act 1941:
    
    And whereas the Boy Scouts Association (New Zealand Branch) Incorporated is governed by a Dominion Council and has its affairs conducted and managed by a Dominion Executive Committee in accordance with its constitution and bylaws as approved by the Boy Scouts Association in Great Britain and delivered to the Registrar of Incorporated Societies pursuant to section 8 of the said Act:
    
    And whereas by resolution duly passed at a meeting of the Dominion Council on 21 September 1951 the Boy Scouts Association (New Zealand Branch) Incorporated, with the approval of the Boy Scouts Association in Great Britain given under the common seal thereof, amended its constitution and bylaws:
    
    And whereas by the constitution aforesaid the Boy Scouts Association (New Zealand Branch) Incorporated became independent of the Boy Scouts Association of Great Britain and became a fully autonomous unit of the Boy Scout movement:
    
    And whereas in the course of its existence the Boy Scouts Association (New Zealand Branch) Incorporated has acquired real and personal property in New Zealand, and gifts, grants, and contributions have been received by it or have been vested in trustees for its benefit or for its use generally or for the benefit of some particular Scout troop, Cub pack, or other local unit within the organisation of the Boy Scouts Association (New Zealand Branch) Incorporated:
    
    And whereas it is desirable that the name of the Boy Scouts Association (New Zealand Branch) Incorporated should be changed to ""The Boy Scouts Association of New Zealand"" in accordance with its independent status as aforesaid.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Scout Association of New Zealand Act 1956\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 24 November 1967, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][15] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][16] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][17] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][18] and [17E][19] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
