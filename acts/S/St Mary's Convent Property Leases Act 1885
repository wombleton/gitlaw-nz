    WHEREAS by deed of conveyance dated the fourth day of June one thousand eight hundred and fifty-nine, made between Jean Babtiste Francois Pompallier of the one part, and Ellen Maher, Maria Franklin, and Margaret Dwyer of the other part, certain land in the City of Auckland aforesaid, and comprised in the [Schedule][5] hereto, was vested in the said Ellen Maher, Maria Franklin, and Margaret Dwyer, their heirs and assigns, upon trust for purposes connected with the Convent for the Roman Catholic religious order of the Sisters of Mercy, and power was given to the said Trustees or the Trustees or Trustee for the time being, with the consent of the Roman Catholic Bishop of the Diocese of Auckland for the time being, to grant leases of the said land or any part or parts thereof for any term not exceeding twenty-one years:
    
    And whereas the said Trustees being dead the said land is now vested in Catherine Delany, Margaret Maria Ennis, and Annie Comerford (hereinafter called **the said Trustees**), which term shall be deemed to include the Trustees or Trustee for the time being of the said land:
    
    And whereas the said Trustees are desirous of leasing a portion of the said land, but for divers reasons it has been found that the power conferred by the said recited deed is inadequate for the purposes thereby intended, and it is deemed advisable and advantageous to extend the said power:
