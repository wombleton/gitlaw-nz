    (4) Where, pursuant to this section, an applicant for letters of administration with or without the will annexed in respect of the estate of any deceased person or any part thereof complies with subsection (1), nothing in the [Administration Act 1969][56] or the Code of Civil Procedure or the practice of the High Court relating to a grant of letters of administration shall be construed as requiring him to do anything further in connection with the application for the purposes of this Act.
    
    (5) This section shall have no application in relation to any grant of administration to a trustee corporation within the meaning of [section 2][57] of the Administration Act 1969, either alone or jointly with another person; and nothing in the [Administration Act 1969][56], the Code of Civil Procedure, or the practice of the High Court shall require the trustee corporation or any other joint applicant for the grant to make inquiries, before the grant is made, as to the existence of any such claimant.

    provided that if it appears to the court that an executor, administrator, or trustee is or may be personally liable for having failed to comply with those provisions, in whole or in part, but has acted honestly, and ought fairly to be excused for his failure, the court may relieve him either wholly or partly from personal liability for the same.

    *   (a) the father and the mother of the child were married to each other at the time of its conception or at some subsequent time; or
    
    *   (b) subject to paragraph (c), paternity has been admitted (expressly or by implication) by or established against the father in his lifetime (whether before or after the birth of the child and whether by 1 or more of the types of evidence specified by [section 8][21] or otherwise) and, if that purpose is for the benefit of the father, paternity has been so admitted or established either before the birth of the child or in its lifetime; or
    
    *   (c) paternity has been established by means of a declaration of paternity made under [section 10][23]---

    (2) In any case where by reason of subsection (1), the relationship of father and child is not recognised for certain purposes at the time the child is born, the occurrence of any act, event, or conduct that enables that relationship, and any other relationship traced in any degree through it, to be recognised shall not---
        
    *   (a) affect any estate, right, or interest in any real or personal property, or any part thereof, if the executor, administrator, or trustee has, by a distribution that is properly paid or applied in terms of subsection (3), placed the property or part beyond the possession and control of the executor, administrator, or trustee (in his capacity as such) to or for the benefit of other beneficiaries otherwise entitled thereto before the act, event, or conduct occurred; or
    
    *   (b) disturb a distribution that is properly paid or applied in terms of subsection (3):
        
        provided that, on any further distribution of the real or personal property or any part thereof after the occurrence, event, or conduct enabling the recognition of the relationship, the earlier distributions shall, so far as possible, be brought into account in determining the respective estates, rights, and interests of the persons then entitled to the property that has not been distributed.
    
    (3) For the purposes of subsection (2), a distribution shall be properly paid or applied if---
        
    *   (a) it is made in accordance with any trust, power, or authority which is subsisting when the distribution is made and which, irrespective of subsequent events, justifies the distribution at the time when it is made; and

        *   (i) without notice of the existence of a person who is entitled by reason only of this Act and the provisions of the enactments governing the distribution of intestate estates or the provisions of the will, deed, or other document governing the distribution of the estate or property; or
