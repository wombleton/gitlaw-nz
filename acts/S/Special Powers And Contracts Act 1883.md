9\. May sell by public auction, and execute a conveyance for the following piece of land in the Village of Waiuku, being Lot No 18:---


All that allotment or parcel of land, containing by admeasurement 1 rood, more or less, situate in the Village of Waiuku, Parish of Waiuku and County of Eden, and being Allotment No 18\.

With the buildings thereon and the rights and appurtenances thereto belonging.

12\. Mr John Chambers being desirous of obtaining a lease, to a company to be hereafter formed, of portions of foreshore as described in the second column hereto, for the purpose of working the iron-sand deposits thereon, the Land Board of Auckland has recommended that leases be issued for a period of 66 years, which recommendation cannot be given effect to owing to the provisions of The Harbours Act 1878\.

12\. May issue leases of the lands hereinafter described, to any company that may be registered for the purpose of working the iron-sand deposits, upon such terms as he may think fit, for any period not exceeding 66 years, namely: All that parcel of land being part of the foreshore of the Manukau Harbour, containing by admeasurement 7 acres 1 rood and 25 perches, more or less. Bounded towards the North by the seaward boundary of Lot 6 of Section 30 of the Town of Onehunga, and the seaward boundary of the road to the eastward of said Lot 6; towards the East by a line being the production of the western boundary of Lot 8 of Section 27 of the Town of Onehunga aforesaid, 1620 links; towards the South by a line, 222 links; and towards the West by lines, 330 links, 1240 links, and 519 links: be all the aforesaid linkages, more or less.


Also, the foreshore between high- and low-water mark, extending for a distance of about four miles, commencing at a point by the production to the sea-coast in a westerly direction of the northern boundary of Lot 59 of the Parish of Karangahape, and extending thence in a southerly direction to Paratutai, on the North Head of Manukau Harbour, with liberty to take iron-sand from the adjoining sandhills at such places and in such manner as shall be approved of by the Governor.

Or, in case equality of exchange cannot be effected, may, for the purpose of arriving at such equality, either purchase land from the owners aforesaid within the said limits, at a price not exceeding one dollar and fifty cents for every acre, or may sell to the said owners Crown lands between the said road and boundary at a price not less than one dollar and fifty cents for every acre.

14\. In 1851 certain land abutting on Alten Road, Auckland, was granted to certain trustees for the maintenance of a college and grammar school. In consequence of inaccuracy of the surveys, the line between the land so granted and this street was placed in a wrong position, as now appears from a recent accurate survey. The strip of land described in the second column, therefore, is found to intervene between the grammar school land, as described by the grant of 1851, and the street. Buildings and fences have been erected on the land, and the street made and used outside the fence. The grammar school leases are just falling in and the property is about to be again leased. The object is to remove all question of title before the new leases are issued.

It was enacted by The Public Reserves Sale Act 1882, that the Governor might declare part of Reserve No 178, containing 180 acres, in the County of Selwyn, open for sale under the provisions of The Land Act 1877\. It is now, however, considered desirable to vest the land in the Board of Conservators of the South Waimakariri District.24\.

All that parcel of land in the Provincial District of Canterbury, containing by admeasurement 301 acres, more or less, being the strip of land, 3 chains wide, extending from the southern bank of the River Waipara in a southerly direction to Reserve No 119 (in red): as the same is delineated on the plan deposited in the District Survey Office, Christchurch.

The disputing tribes refused to proceed with any matter before the Ngaterangi were satisfied for the injury done them. After a long discussion it was arranged that 49 ½ acres of land belonging to Rawiri te Wakaite and others of the Thames tribes, should be given in payment to Akapita te Tere and others of the Ngaterangi tribe as compensation; and one of the conditions of settlement was that a Crown grant should be made of the land to be given, and this was promised.32\.
