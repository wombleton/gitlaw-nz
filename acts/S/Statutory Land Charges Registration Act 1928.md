BE IT ENACTED by the General Assembly of New Zealand in Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:---

##### 1 Short Title
    
*   This Act may be cited as the Statutory Land Charges Registration Act 1928\.

##### 2 Interpretation
    
*   In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,---
    
    _Land_ has the same meaning as in the [Land Transfer Act 1952][14] and includes a mining residence site
    
    Land: the ""Land Transfer Act 1952"" has been substituted for the repealed ""Land Transfer Act 1915"", and the words ""and includes a mining residence site"" were added by section 2(1) of the Statutory Land Charges Registration Amendment Act 1959\.
    
    _Mining residence site_ means any residence site in respect of which there exists a licence granted under the Mining Act 1926 or under any former Mining Act; and includes any land in respect of which there exists a lease granted under section 45 or section 47 of the Mining Act 1926 or under the corresponding provisions of any former Mining Act
    
    Mining residence site: this definition was inserted by section 2(2) of the Statutory Land Charges Registration Amendment Act 1959\. The ""Mining Act 1926"" was repealed and replaced by the Mining Act 1971\.
    
    _Purchaser_ means any person (including a mortgagee or lessee) who, for valuable consideration, takes any interest in land or in a charge on land; and _purchase_ has a corresponding meaning
    
    _Registered_, in relation to any mining residence site which is not registered under the [Land Transfer Act 1952][14], means registered in the office of a Mining Registrar, and, in relation to any other land, means registered under the [Land Transfer Act 1952][14] or under the [Deeds Registration Act 1908][15]; and _register_ and _registration_ have meanings corresponding to the meaning of the term _registered_
    
    Registered: this definition was substituted by section 2(3) Statutory Land Charges Registration Amendment Act 1959\.
    
    _Registrar_, in relation to any mining residence site which is not registered under the [Land Transfer Act 1952][14], means the Mining Registrar in whose office the licence or lease is registered; and, in relation to any other land, means the District Land Registrar or the Registrar of Deeds for the district in which the land is situated.
    
    Registrar: this definition was substituted by section 2(3) Statutory Land Charges Registration Amendment Act 1959\.

##### 12 Regulations
    
*   The Governor-General may from time to time by Order in Council make all such regulations as may in his opinion be necessary for the purpose of giving full effect to this Act.
