If either or both of the parties indicate in writing an unwillingness to renew or renegotiate this Agreement, or the parties do not indicate either way, then this Agreement will terminate on the date specified in paragraph (a).

### _Remuneration_

*   19 Remuneration of the sharemilker for work performed by the sharemilker and the sharemilker's employees under this Agreement is as follows:

    *   (a) for herds where the minimum number stipulated in [clause 42][21] is not more than 300 cows,---
            
        *   (i) **Milk price plus any dividend-related payment adjustment (DRPA)**
            
            The sharemilker must receive not less than 21% of income derived from milk supplied to the dairy company during the duration of this Agreement, including deferred payments, from the herd milked by the sharemilker, for the total cost of labour, the rearing of replacement calves under [clauses 21 to 25][22], and all aspects of the operation and management of the farm under this Agreement. The 21% is net of the sharemilker's farm operating expenses and must not be reduced in any way or by any means other than under [clauses 63 to 66][23] or by the result of dispute resolution as provided for under this Agreement.
            
            The farm operating costs outlined in this Agreement to be paid by the sharemilker recorded in Annex 1 will be calculated as a percentage of milk income and added to the 21% to arrive at the agreed share.
            
            An agreed share of the milk price of the dairy company: \[_number_\]% to the farm owner and \[_number_\]% to the sharemilker plus an adjustment to the sharemilker's milk price, to reflect the agreed share of any dividend (distributable profit less retentions) paid to the farm owner.
            
            The farm owner and the sharemilker agree to share the revenue from the dividend in the following proportions: \[_number_\]% to the farm owner and \[_number_\]% to the sharemilker, based on the option chosen below.
            
            If the parties agree that part of the remuneration to the sharemilker is from the net dividend payment from the dairy company to shareholders, the farm owner will indicate the shares to calculate this as follows:
                
            *   ###### Delete 3 options
            
            *   • **Option 1**: All shares. Where this option is selected, the farm owner will advise the sharemilker of any change to the number of fully paid shares as stated in [clause 1][24] during this Agreement.
            
            *   • **Option 2**: Minimum required shares as stated on the dairy company's records (ie, production-backed shares relating to this supply number) at the start of each dairy season to which this Agreement applies.

            *   • **Option 4**: Production. Where this option is selected, the sharemilker is not entitled to the DRPA on production exceeding the fully paid shares as stated in [clause 1][24] unless the farm owner, in the farm owner's sole discretion, chooses to purchase additional shares and also chooses to include those additional shares in the calculation of the sharemilker's DRPA.
            
            **Note:** Where no option is selected (ie, 3 options have not been deleted), the default option will be: ""Production"". 
            
            The farm owner is to pay directly or through the dairy company an adjustment to the milk price to reflect this decision in the same month the farm owner receives the dividend.
            
            During the term of this Agreement, the farm owner warrants that any shares held will not be disposed of without consultation between the parties, and the sharemilker must not be financially disadvantaged by any disposition.
        
        *   (ii) **Milk price only**
            
            If the parties agree not to share the revenue from the dividend under the dividend-related payment adjustment (_DRPA_), the parties will agree to a minimum percentage under [clause 19(a)][16] to be increased by 1%, to 22%.
        
        
    
    *   (b) for all other herds where the minimum number stipulated in [clause 42(c)][21] is more than 300 cows. The agreed share is not limited by [clause 19(a)][16] and the sharemilker must receive \[_number_\]% (the **agreed share**) of the proceeds from all milk products (the **milk price**) from the herd milked by the sharemilker during the period of this Agreement, including deferred payments.
        
        *   (i) **Milk price plus any dividend-related payment adjustment (DRPA)**
            
            An agreed share of the milk price of the dairy company: \[_number_\]% to the farm owner and \[_number_\]% to the sharemilker plus an adjustment to the sharemilker's milk price, to reflect the agreed share of any dividend (distributable profit less retentions) paid to the farm owner.
            
            The farm owner and the sharemilker agree to share the revenue from the dividend in the following proportions: \[_number_\]% to the farm owner and \[_number_\]% to the sharemilker, based on the option selected below.
            
            If the parties agree that part of the remuneration to the sharemilker is from the net dividend payment from the dairy company to shareholders, the farm owner will indicate the shares to calculate this as follows:
                
            *   ###### Delete 3 options
            
            *   • **Option 1**: All shares. Where this option is selected, the farm owner will advise the sharemilker of any change to the number of fully paid shares as stated in [clause 1][24] during this Agreement.
            
            *   • **Option 2**: Minimum required shares as stated on the dairy company's records (ie, production-backed shares relating to this supply number) at the start of each season to which this Agreement applies. The minimum number of required shares for the first season to which this Agreement applies is \[_number_\]. Where this option is selected, the farm owner will advise the sharemilker of any change to the minimum required shares at the start of each subsequent season to which this Agreement applies.

            **Note:** Where no option is selected (ie, 3 options have not been deleted), the default option will be: ""Production"". 
            
            The farm owner is to pay directly or through the dairy company an adjustment to the milk price to reflect this decision in the same month the farm owner receives the dividend.
            
            During the term of this Agreement, the farm owner warrants that any shares held will not be disposed of without consultation between the parties, and the sharemilker is not to be financially disadvantaged by any disposition.

The cost of any consultation is to be shared in the same proportion as specified in clause 19\.

### Harvesting

*   98 Unless otherwise agreed, the costs incurred in employing contractors for any harvesting, collection, carting, and stacking of surplus feed on the land, including the extra labour and machinery required, must be paid by the farm owner. If the parties agree to share the costs, the share to be paid by the sharemilker must not exceed the agreed share and must be recorded in the table in clause 106 and reflected in costs allocated in Annex 1\. For the cost of harvesting maize silage, see clause 101\.

*   99 The sharemilker must provide the sharemilker's labour and the labour of his or her employees at no cost to the farm owner for the harvesting of surplus feed.

### Forage crops and maize silage

*   100 The growing of green feed or other forage crops on the land is to be determined by the farm owner in consultation with the sharemilker and must be recorded in writing. The farm owner must provide seeds, fertiliser, fencing materials, and any other materials required to carry out this work. If outside contractors are used, the farm owner must meet that cost.

*   101 Unless otherwise agreed, in the case of maize grown for silage on the land, the cost of growing and harvesting the crop must be paid by the farm owner. If the parties agree to share the cost, the share to be paid by the sharemilker must not exceed the agreed share recorded in the table in clause 106 and must be reflected in the costs allocated in Annex 1\.

*   102 The sharemilker must provide the sharemilker's labour and the labour of his or her employees at no cost to the farm owner for the growing and harvesting of forage crops and maize silage.

### Nitrogen

*   103 Unless otherwise agreed, the costs, including cartage and spreading where a contractor is used, of applying urea to boost seasonal pasture growth on the land, except as provided for in clause 50, must be paid by the farm owner. If the parties agree to share the cost, the share to be paid by the sharemilker must not exceed the agreed share and must be recorded in the table in clause 106 and reflected in costs allocated in Annex 1\. If the parties agree that the sharemilker will share the cost of the application of compound nitrogenous fertiliser to boost seasonal pasture growth, the cost to the sharemilker will be determined by calculating the nitrogen content based on the equivalent cost of urea.

### Purchased feed

*   104 Unless otherwise agreed, the landed cost of bought-in supplementary feed for the stock that is the subject of this Agreement, except as provided for in clause 50, including meal purchased for calves, must be met by the farm owner. If the parties agree to share the cost, the share to be paid by the sharemilker must not exceed the agreed share and must be recorded in the table in clause 106 and reflected in costs allocated in Annex 1\.

### Grazing off

*   105 Unless otherwise agreed, the cost including cartage of the grazing off of any stock that is the subject of this Agreement, except as provided for in clause 50, must be paid by the farm owner. If the parties agree to share the cost, the share to be paid by the sharemilker must not exceed the agreed share and must be recorded in the table in clause 106 and reflected in costs allocated in Annex 1\. The conditions of grazing off must be recorded in writing before the stock is grazed off.

*   106 Insert the % share relating to clauses 98 to 105:

### Cash cropping

*   107 If the parties agree that a cash crop is to be grown on the dairying area, the terms and conditions of cropping including the sharemilker's return must be agreed in writing before the preparation of any land for that purpose.

### Freight and droving fees

*   108 All costs of cartage incidental to the farming operations (except where otherwise provided for in this Agreement) and all droving fees (except for the droving by the sharemilker or the sharemilker's employees of the stock that is the subject of this Agreement, to outside grazing) must be paid by the farm owner.

### Water

*   109 The farm owner must provide a water supply system of sufficient capacity to provide water of acceptable quality for stock, farm dairy, and household purposes. If satisfactory drinking water for domestic use cannot be obtained from other sources, sufficient tank accommodation for the collection of rainwater must be provided at the sharemilker's house. The cost of purchased water for household purposes must be paid by the farm owner.

*   110 The cost of providing water to stock, the farm dairy, and for household purposes must be paid for by the sharemilker as follows:
        
    *   (a) if the farm owner provides a pressurised water reticulation system or if the farm is supplied through a pressurised system from a storage tank fed by a trickle-feed community water scheme, the sharemilker must pay the cost of the electricity for pumping the water:
    
    *   (b) if the farm is supplied from a pressurised community scheme, the parties must pay the cost of the water supplied from the community scheme in the agreed share.
    
    

*   The sharemilker is responsible for minor repairs to the water system and regular maintenance of the water pump, and the farm owner must provide the materials, where necessary, for this purpose. Any provision for the historical use of the community water supplied to the land must be recorded in Annex 1\.

*   **Note: **It is recommended that the sharemilker ascertain the costs of metered water before signing this Agreement.

*   111 In the event of a serious interruption to the water supply or the need for major repairs to the supply, the sharemilker must immediately advise the farm owner, who must take prompt steps, at the farm owner's expense, to remedy the situation. If a shortfall is due to climatic conditions or a serious malfunction of the water supply system outside the sharemilker's control, the farm owner must meet the cost of imported water.

*   112 If water is being used for a purpose for which the sharemilker does not receive a share of the returns, except for use at the farm owner's house, then all costs associated with the supply of water to such areas must be paid by the farm owner.

### Irrigation

*   113 If irrigation of pastures is practised, the sharemilker is responsible for shifting the irrigation plant and equipment as required by the farm owner. The sharemilker is responsible for minor repairs and the regular maintenance of the irrigation system, and must provide the farm owner with the materials, if necessary, for that purpose.

*   114 The sharing of the total cost of the irrigation operation is to be decided before the signing of this Agreement and must be recorded in Annex 1\.

### Accommodation

*   115 On the commencement of this Agreement, the farm owner (or the farm owner's agent) and the sharemilker must inspect the house and surrounds together and---
        
    *   (a) a written record must be made of any existing damage or wear and tear using the Accommodation Checklist in [Annex 2][36]; and
    
    *   (b) any improvements to be undertaken by the farm owner must be recorded, with a date by which the work will be completed. Both the farm owner and the sharemilker must have a copy of this record, to be signed by both parties.
    
    

*   116 The farm owner must provide and maintain in good order and condition suitable accommodation for the sharemilker and the sharemilker's employees. The sharemilker may make this house available to the farm manager. The accommodation must consist of suitable living room, kitchen, including a stove operating to the manufacturer's specifications, bedrooms, bathroom, laundry, and flush toilet. The accommodation must include---
        
    *   (a) running water, a sewerage system, and fixtures suitable for modern laundry appliances; and
    
    *   (b) a suitable heating system supplied at the cost of the farm owner; and
    
    *   (c) adequate drapes, fixed floor coverings, and light fittings; and
    
    *   (d) a garage or carport provided by the farm owner; and
    
    *   (e) adequate telephone facility; and
    
    *   (f) a secure stock-proof fence enclosing house and surrounds.
    
    

*   117 The cost of septic tank cleaning is to be paid by the farm owner.

*   118 The cost of electricity for lighting, heating, and power (including for pumping water) at the sharemilker's house is to be paid by the sharemilker.

*   119 The sharemilker must keep the house and the surrounds in good and clean condition, and is responsible for any damage sustained to the house and pertinent buildings during the sharemilker's occupation (except fair wear and tear).

*   120 On termination of this Agreement, the sharemilker must leave the house, chattels, and surrounds in a clean and tidy condition. If the sharemilker fails to do so, the farm owner is entitled to have the premises cleaned and to deduct the cost of the cleaning from any money due to the sharemilker.

*   121 Neither the sharemilker nor the sharemilker's employees are a tenant of the land or any building. If the sharemilker or the sharemilker's employees are given notice of early termination of this Agreement, the sharemilker or the sharemilker's employees have 14 working days to vacate any accommodation provided as part of the contract.

*   122 The farm owner (or the farm owner's agent) has the right to inspect the sharemilker's accommodation. The farm owner (or the farm owner's agent) must give the sharemilker 24 hours' notice of the inspection.

### Administration _Accident compensation levies_ 

*   123 The sharemilker is responsible during the term of this Agreement for paying the sharemilker's and sharemilker's employees' accident compensation levies as required under legislation.

### Occupational safety and health

*   124 The farm owner and the sharemilker acknowledge that safety in the workplace is a priority to both parties and that both parties will take all practicable measures to ensure safe working conditions and to comply with the Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992\. To this end, the parties agree to take all practicable steps to provide a safe working environment, and act in accordance with good practice and relevant standards set by the Department of Labour. If either of the parties brings people onto the farm, that party will be responsible for those person's safety.

### Federated Farmers

*   125 The farm owner agrees to provide reasonable access to officials of the Federation or any duly appointed representative of the sharemilker.

### Disease reactors

*   126 If an appropriate authority orders the slaughtering of an in-milk cow, and the slaughtering of the animal does not reduce the herd to below the minimum number specified in clause 42, the farm owner may elect whether or not to replace it with a similar-producing animal.

*   127 If slaughtering referred to in clause 126 reduces the herd below the minimum number specified in this Agreement, the farm owner must, at the farm owner's expense, within 14 working days of the animal leaving the farm, replace it with another similar-producing animal, unless the parties agree in writing that it should not be replaced.

*   128 If there is a production compensation paid on account of the slaughtering of such animals, then the sharemilker is entitled to receive the sharemilker's share of the compensation.

### Termination procedures

*   129 The farm owner must advise the sharemilker in writing 3 months before the end of the contract of the work required to be done to meet the terms and conditions of this Agreement. This does not exempt the sharemilker from carrying out maintenance work until the end of this Agreement.
    
    **Note:** It is strongly recommended that the parties record in writing 3 months before the end of the contract any action that may be required to fulfil the terms and conditions of this Agreement relating to pasture and supplementary feed on hand upon termination (_see _[clauses 53][37] and [54][38]).

*   130 If there is a shortfall of feed on hand on termination of this Agreement, then the cost of meeting the shortfall must be met by the parties according to the terms and conditions of clause 56\.

### Death of party

*   131 If this Agreement is made with a sole sharemilker and the sharemilker dies during the period of this Agreement, the Agreement will terminate as from the date of the sharemilker's death. In this case, the personal representatives of the estate of the sharemilker are entitled under clauses 19 to 29 to all money due to the sharemilker at the time of the sharemilker's death, including deferred or final payments, but subject to adjustment in respect of any other matters of income or outgoings (or both) arising under this Agreement.

*   132 If this Agreement is with a sharemilking partnership and 1 of the partners dies during the period of this Agreement, the remaining partner or partners have the option of terminating this Agreement immediately or at the conclusion of the season, but the farm owner has the prior option of terminating the Agreement within 1 month of the date of death of the sharemilker in the event that the remaining partner or partners cannot continue to the satisfaction of the farm owner.
    
    In either case, the personal representatives of the estate of the deceased sharemilker and the remaining partner or partners are entitled under [clauses 19 to 29][16] to all money due to the partnership at the time of the conclusion of this Agreement, including deferred or final payments up to the date of the conclusion, but subject to adjustment in respect of any other matters of income or outgoings (or both) arising under the terms of this Agreement.

*   133 If the farm owner dies during the period of this Agreement, the Agreement will terminate at the end of the current season.

### Matters not provided for

*   134 If this Agreement is silent on any matter or thing that becomes the subject of dispute between the parties, then that matter or thing must be determined in accordance with the custom prevailing in the district. If there is no custom prevailing in the district, the matter or thing must be determined in accordance with equity and good conscience.

### Breach of Agreement

*   135 If the sharemilker commits a serious breach of this Agreement, the farm owner may give the sharemilker notice in writing to remedy the breach. If the breach is not rectified within 10 working days, or recurs, the farm owner may terminate this Agreement immediately and the sharemilker is entitled only to money actually due to the sharemilker at the time of termination, but without prejudice to---
        
    *   (a) the rights of the farm owner to recover damages for breach of this Agreement:
    
    *   (b) the right of the sharemilker to refer the matter to conciliation under [clauses 142 to 148][39]. 
    
    Any sharemilker who uses, possesses, or cultivates any illegal substance or who commits an offence against the [Misuse of Drugs Act 1975][40] is to be treated as having committed a serious breach of this Agreement and those actions constitute grounds for immediate termination of this Agreement.

*   136 If the farm owner commits a serious breach of this Agreement, the sharemilker may give the farm owner notice in writing to remedy the breach and, if the breach is not rectified within 10 working days or recurs, the sharemilker may terminate the Agreement immediately. If this Agreement is terminated under this clause, the sharemilker is entitled to money actually due to the sharemilker at the time of the termination and subsequent payments on production up to the date of termination. Termination of this Agreement under this clause does not affect the rights of the sharemilker to recover damages for breach of this Agreement, the rights of any other sharemilker, or the farm owner's right to refer the matter to conciliation under clauses 142 to 148\.

*   137 If either party disputes the right of the other party to terminate this Agreement, the dispute must be referred to conciliation under clauses 142 to 148\.
    
    **Note:** A breach capable of rectification is not grounds for termination of this Agreement.

### Notices

*   138 A notice given to the farm owner or the sharemilker is to be treated as having been served if---
        
    *   (a) the notice is handed to that person or that person's nominated representative under [clause 16(a)][41]; or
    
    *   (b) the notice is posted in a letter addressed to the person at that person's place of residence or business in New Zealand. A notice sent by post is to be treated as having been served on the 5th working day after the day it was posted; or

    *   (d) the notice is sent by fax to a fax number recorded on this Agreement, or, if applicable, to a number supplied by the intended recipient to replace his or her fax number as recorded on this Agreement. A notice sent by fax is, in the absence of proof to the contrary, served or given if the sender's fax machine generated a record of the transmission of the notice to the fax machine of the recipient, and the date of the record is to be treated as the date of receipt of the notice; or
    
    *   (e) the notice is sent by email or other means of electronic communication to an email address recorded on this Agreement, or, if applicable, to an email address supplied by the intended recipient to replace his or her email address as recorded on this Agreement. A notice sent by email or other means of electronic communication is, in the absence of proof to the contrary, to be treated as having been served or given,---
            
        *   (i) in the case of an addressee who has designated an email or electronic communication address for the purpose of being served, at the time the email or electronic message is sent; or
        
        *   (ii) in any other case, at the time the email or electronic communication comes to the attention of the addressee; or
        
        
    
    *   (f) the notice is served by any other legally recognised means of service.
    
    

### Claims

*   139 No claim by the farm owner against the sharemilker or the sharemilker against the farm owner in any way arising out of this Agreement in relation to operations during any one milking season (whether the Agreement is renewed or not) will be recognised or sustainable, and no action in respect of any claim is enforceable, unless full details of the claim in writing (the notice of dispute) are served by the claimant on the respondent within 20 working days of the claimant becoming aware of the alleged breach of this Agreement, but in any event no later than 20 working days from the end of the season to which the alleged breach relates, time being strictly of the essence. 

### Counterclaims

*   140 If a claim is made by either party, a period of 10 working days after the claim has been served is permitted within which to make a counterclaim. No counterclaim will be recognised or sustainable, and no action in respect of any counterclaim will be enforceable, unless adequate details, in writing, of the counterclaim have been served by the respondent on the claimant within that 10-working-day period.

*   141 A party to this Agreement must not withhold proceeds or commence court action or arbitration relating to any dispute arising out of this Agreement unless that party has first completed the dispute resolution procedures set out in clauses 142 to 148\.

### Dispute resolution

*   142 If any dispute arises out of and in relation to this Agreement,---
        
    *   (a) the parties to this Agreement will negotiate in good faith and co-operate and use their best endeavours to resolve the dispute expeditiously. The parties may ask an independent third party to assist them to resolve the dispute; and
    
    *   (b) if the dispute is not resolved under paragraph (a) within 10 working days of receipt of the notice of dispute (or any further period that may be agreed in writing), the parties must proceed to conciliation and appoint a conciliator; and 
    
    *   (c) if the parties are unable to agree on a conciliator within 5 working days of proceeding to conciliation under paragraph (b), the conciliator will be appointed from the National Panel of Conciliators and either party may request the Chairperson of the Panel to make an appointment; and
    
    *   (d) the conciliator must convene a conciliation meeting as soon as practicable; and
    
    *   (e) the conciliator must assist the parties in an independent and impartial manner to reconcile their views on the dispute or difference to reach an amicable settlement or a solution; and
    
    *   (f) if the parties are unable to reach an agreement or a solution, the conciliator must produce a written reasoned proposal for the determination of the dispute; and
    
    *   (g) the conciliator's proposal for determination is binding on both parties unless within 5 working days of receiving the proposal at least one party notifies the other in writing that they reject the conciliator's proposal; and
    
    *   (h) if the conciliator is unable to convene a conciliation meeting within 20 working days of the notice of dispute (or any further period as may be agreed in writing) because of lack of response from either party or for any other reason, the conciliator must notify both parties that the conciliation has been unsuccessful.
    
    

*   143 The conciliation procedure terminates---
        
    *   (a) by the signing of a settlement agreement by the parties; or
    
    *   (b) by a written declaration of one party to the other and to the conciliator that the conciliation is terminated; or
    
    *   (c) by a written declaration by the conciliator to the parties that the conciliation has been unsuccessful; or
    
    *   (d) by the parties not objecting to the conciliator's proposal for determination in writing within 5 working days of receipt of the conciliator's proposal; or
    
    *   (e) by the passing of 20 working days or more from the date of service of the notice of dispute without a conciliated outcome and where the parties have not agreed to extend time for the conciliation process to continue.
    
    

*   144 The parties must pay half the costs of the conciliation as well as paying their own costs of the conciliation procedure.

*   145 All discussions in the conciliation process are without prejudice to, and must not be referred to in, any subsequent proceedings of any kind.

*   146 The conciliator must not, unless by consent of the parties, act as arbitrator, witness, counsel, adviser, or representative of any party in any subsequent arbitration or judicial proceedings in respect of any dispute that has been the subject of the conciliation procedure where he or she has been the conciliator.

*   147 If the dispute is not resolved by agreement within 20 working days of the notice of dispute, the parties' dispute must be treated as having been submitted to arbitration as provided for in clauses 149 to 159\.

*   148 If the dispute is not resolved by conciliation, the farm owner is entitled to withhold the sharemilker's proceeds to the value of the claim as follows:
        
    *   (a) the farm owner must notify the sharemilker in writing of the intention to retain the sharemilker's payment:
    
    *   (b) the farm owner is not entitled to retain or deduct from any one payment due or to become due to the sharemilker more than 75% of any such payment:

### Arbitration

*   149 If a dispute, difference, or question arises between the parties or a party's representative in relation to the construction of this Agreement or in relation to any matter or thing connected with or arising out of this Agreement (a dispute) that cannot be resolved by conciliation under clauses 142 to 148, the dispute must, in the absence of any provision to the contrary, be referred to arbitration with a sole arbitrator in accordance with and subject to the Arbitration Act 1996\.

*   150 Arbitration is commenced by one party serving notice in writing on the other party.

*   151 The parties may agree on the arbitrator. If the parties are unable to agree on the arbitrator within 20 working days of the dispute being referred to arbitration, then the arbitrator is to be appointed by the President of the Arbitrators' and Mediators' Institute of New Zealand Incorporated (or the President's nominee) in accordance with the Arbitration Act 1996\. The arbitrator must not be a person who has participated in any conciliation procedure in respect of the dispute unless by consent of the parties.

*   152 The arbitrator must deliver an award within 3 months of the arbitrator's appointment. The parties agree to fully co-operate in the arbitration. Subject to the Arbitration Act 1996, the arbitrator may conduct the arbitration in the manner that the arbitrator considers appropriate.

*   153 If the farm owner withholds more money from the sharemilker than the amount the farm owner is claiming, then, in the absence of extenuating circumstances, the arbitrator must award interest on that money at a rate of 8% per month or part of the month compounding.

*   154 If the farm owner withholds only the amount being claimed and the farm owner's claims are subsequently not awarded in full, then, in the absence of extenuating circumstances, the arbitrator must award interest at a rate of up to 5% per month or part of the month compounding on the excess money withheld.

*   155 The arbitrator has the power to direct by whom, in what amounts, and in what manner any fees and charges must be paid.

*   156 The arbitrator may require the parties to lodge with the arbitrator a sum of money as a deposit against the arbitrator's fees and charges.

*   157 In assessing a claim for interest, the arbitrator may set interest rates in excess of the rate prescribed under section 87(3) of the Judicature Act 1908 if the arbitrator considers it appropriate to do so.

*   158 The arbitrator must give the award in writing within 1 month of the hearing. However, the arbitrator may extend the time for giving the award by a further month by giving notice in writing to the parties.

*   159 The award in the arbitration is final and binding on the parties. The parties agree that clause 5(1)(c) of Schedule 2 of the Arbitration Act 1996 (which allows the High Court to grant leave to appeal on any question of law arising out of an award) does not apply to the arbitration.

### Public liability insurance

*   160 The farm owner and the sharemilker must each take out public liability insurance to a recommended amount of at least $2 million. At the commencement of this Agreement, each party must produce to the other a copy of the certificate of insurance cover.

### Sale of farm

*   161 The farm owner has the right at any time during this Agreement to sell the farm or any part of the farm and, in doing so, to cancel this Agreement. If the farm owner sells the farm or any part of the farm, the sharemilker is entitled to receive from the farm owner the sharemilker's proportion of the actual, deferred, and final payment unpaid on milk or milksolids produced during the season up to the date on which the cancellation takes effect, together with an amount equal to the sharemilker's net proportion of the value of the estimated milk or milksolids for the unexpired period of the season, including deferred and final payment. If the farm owner and the sharemilker fail to agree as to the estimated amount of milk or milksolids, the previous 3 years' average production must be used as the basis for the calculation. The total production in the previous 3 seasons for the month in question must be divided by the number of cows milked during those months in the previous 3 seasons, giving, for the purposes of the calculation, a standard of production per cow.
    
    If the farm owner has not been dairying on the farm during the previous 3 years, the standard of production per cow for the purposes of the calculation is the declared average production per cow supplied during the months that milk was supplied to the farm owner's dairy company from all its suppliers in the previous year. From the sharemilker's proportion of the estimated gross value of the standard production per cow must be deducted the estimated cost of production per cow by way of labour charges, shed expenses, power costs, and all other charges that are the responsibility of the sharemilker. The difference must then be multiplied by the number of cows milked at the date on which the cancellation takes effect, and the result is the sharemilker's net proportion of the value of the estimated milk or milksolids for the unexpired period of the season, including deferred and final payments.
