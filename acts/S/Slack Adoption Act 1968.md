An Act to give to an interim order of adoption made on 4 November 1965 in favour of Terence Richard Slack and Margaret Ann Slack as adopting parents of Michael William Slack force and effect as if it had been a final order of adoption made on the same day
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    Whereas Michael William Slack (hereinafter called the _child_) was born on 8 August 1965 and was the subject of an application for adoption made to the Magistrate's Court at Kaikohe by Terence Richard Slack late of Waiwatenui, farmer, deceased (hereinafter called the _father_) and Margaret Ann Slack, his wife (hereinafter called the _mother_) upon which an interim order was made in favour of the father and the mother on 4 November 1965:
    
    And whereas the father died on 19 March 1966, leaving the residue of his estate to be divided equally between his children living at his death and in circumstances that gave his dependants the right to compensation under the Workers' Compensation Act 1956:
    
    And whereas the father had no natural children but prior to his death he and the mother had duly adopted Philip George Slack born on 28 August 1963 (hereinafter referred to as the _brother_):
    
    And whereas no application for a final order of adoption of the child had (or could have) been made prior to the death of the father but such application was made by the mother on 24 May 1966 and on the same day such final order was made and (after full disclosure of the facts) expressed by the court to be in favour of the father and the mother:
    
    And whereas the mother, the brother, and the child were all totally dependent on the father at the time of his death:
    
    And whereas it is accepted by all interested parties that it would have been the wish of the father that the brother and the child should share equally in his estate and in any benefit arising upon his death:
    
    And whereas notwithstanding the terms in which the final order of adoption is expressed it did not create or cause to exist between the father and child the full legal consequence of such a relationship at the date of the father's death and as a result the child is not entitled to be treated as a dependant or a relative within the meaning of the Workers' Compensation Act 1956 (and therefore not entitled to any moneys payable under the claim arising under that Act) or to be treated as a child of the father (and therefore entitled to a share in his estate):
    
    And whereas it is the desire of all interested parties that the wishes of the father (hereinbefore referred to) be carried out by securing equality of treatment in all respects between the child and the brother:
    
    And whereas it appears that this can be effected only by enacting that the interim order of adoption in respect of the child shall be deemed for all purposes to be and always to have been a final order.

##### 1 Short Title
    
*   This Act may be cited as the Slack Adoption Act 1968\.

##### 2 Conversion of interim order of adoption into final order
    
*   The interim order made by the Magistrate's Court at Kaikohe on 4 November 1965 on the application of Terence Richard Slack and Margaret Ann Slack to adopt the child thereby renamed Michael William Slack shall operate and for all purposes be deemed always to have operated as a final order of adoption; and it is hereby declared that the legal effects and incidents of such order shall be the same as if the Magistrate's Court at Kaikohe had on 4 November 1965 made a final order of adoption in favour of the said Terence Richard Slack and Margaret Ann Slack in respect of the child known as the result of such order as Michael William Slack.

##### 3 Private Act
    
*   This Act is hereby declared to be a private Act.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Slack Adoption Act 1968\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 26 November 1968, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][6] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][7] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][8] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][9] and [17E][10] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
