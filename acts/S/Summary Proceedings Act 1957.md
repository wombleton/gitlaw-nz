##### 20A Summary procedure for minor offences
    
*   (1) Where a charge is brought by any informant of the kind described in subsection (10) against any person for any minor offence (as defined in subsection (12)) a summons to the defendant shall not be issued in the first instance, unless the informant satisfies the Registrar that for special reasons a summons should be issued or a District Court Judge or Community Magistrate so directs.
    
    (2) Unless a summons is to be so issued, all proceedings brought under this Part in respect of a minor offence shall be commenced by the informant filing a notice of prosecution in the prescribed form specifying the date and nature of the alleged offence and a summary of the facts on which the informant bases his allegation that an offence has been committed, and any other matters (not being previous convictions) which the informant considers are relevant to the imposition of a penalty. The summary of the facts shall be sufficient to fully and fairly inform the defendant of the allegations against him.
    
    (3) In addition the notice shall---
        
    *   (a) specify the maximum penalty for the offence:
    
    *   (b) specify the minimum penalty for the offence if such a penalty is expressly provided for:
    
    *   (c) show whether conviction for the offence would or could result---
            
        *   (i) in the defendant being disqualified from holding or obtaining a driver's licence or any other licence or privilege or the forfeiture of any property; or
        
        *   (ii) in demerit points being recorded under the [Land Transport Act 1998][594] in respect of the defendant:
        
        
    
    *   (d) inform the defendant of his or her rights under subsections (5) to (8) and of the right that the court has under [section 106][555] of the Sentencing Act 2002 to discharge a person without conviction:
    
    *   (e) be accompanied by particulars of any previous conviction of the defendant if the informant wishes the court to take that conviction into account in the event of the defendant being found guilty:
    
    *   (f) contain such other information or advice as may be required by or pursuant to this Act:
    
    *   (g) set out the full name of the informant and, for the purposes of subsection (10), the capacity in which he is acting in filing the notice:
    
    *   (h) be signed by the informant who shall certify that he believes that he has just cause for his allegation and that, to the best of his knowledge and belief, his summary of the facts and the other particulars relating to the offence or to the defendant are true and correct.
    
    (4) The Registrar shall cause a copy of the notice to be served on the defendant.
    
    (5) If the defendant wishes to deny the charge or to appear before the court for that or any other purpose he must send written advice to that effect to the Registrar by a date specified in the notice, being a date not earlier than 28 days after the date of the notice. Any such advice shall be sufficient for the purposes of this section if, however expressed, it indicates the defendant's wishes.
    
    (6) The defendant may plead guilty in accordance with [section 41][62] and may, in the notice required by that section,---
        
    *   (a) state matters which he wishes the court to take into consideration:
    
    *   (b) make submissions with regard to the appropriate penalty:
    
    *   (c) put forward reasons why he should be discharged without conviction under [section 106][555] of the Sentencing Act 2002\.
    
    (7) If the defendant pleads guilty in accordance with [section 41][62] or if, in any case, the defendant does not, by the date specified in the notice referred to in subsection (2), give written advice to the Registrar in accordance with subsection (5), a District Court Judge or Community Magistrate may, on the basis of the summary of the facts contained in the notice referred to in subsection (2), deal with the defendant as if he had appeared before a court and pleaded guilty. Where particulars of any previous conviction of the defendant have accompanied that notice, the District Court Judge or Community Magistrate may take that conviction into account in deciding whether or not to impose a penalty and, if one is imposed, its amount.
    
    (8) If the defendant indicates in accordance with subsection (5) that the defendant wishes to deny the charge or to appear before the court for that or any other purpose or if in any case a District Court Judge or Community Magistrate so directs, a summons, in the prescribed form, must be issued to the defendant by a District Court Judge, Justice, Community Magistrate, or Registrar (not being a constable) and subsequent proceedings must be had on that summons as if the notice under subsection (2) were an information.
    
    (9) [Sections 14][25], [16][27], [17][28], [18][30], [34][55], [36][57], [71][108], [75][115], [204][444], [205][445], and [208][448], [Part 4][237], and the [Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967][617] shall apply, with such modifications as are necessary, to every notice of prosecution filed under subsection (2) as if it were an information.
    
    (10) A notice under subsection (2) may be filed only by---
        
    *   (a) a constable:
    
    *   (b) an enforcement officer under the [Land Transport Act 1998][594]:
    
    *   (c) a person acting in the course of his official duties as an officer or employee of any of the State Services, a local authority, a public body, or a statutory Board:
    
    *   (d) any other class of person approved for the time being for the purposes of this section by the Minister of Justice by notice in the _Gazette_. Any such approval may be conditional or may apply only in respect of specified offences or classes of offences.
    
    (11) Every certificate given by an informant under paragraph (h) of subsection (3) shall be deemed to be a statement for the purposes of [section 111][618] of the Crimes Act 1961 (which relates to false statements) notwithstanding that it is not required to be made before any person.
    
    (12) For the purposes of this section, the term _minor offence_ means,---
        
    *   (a) in the case of a summary offence under the [Land Transport Act 1998][594], a summary offence under that Act for which the defendant is not liable on conviction to a sentence of imprisonment or to a fine exceeding $2,000:
    
    *   (b) in any other case, means any summary offence for which the defendant is not liable on conviction to a sentence of imprisonment or to a fine exceeding $500\.
    
    (13) This section shall not apply where the defendant, or, where 2 or more persons are jointly charged, at least 1 of the defendants, is under the age of 17 years, unless the charge is for a traffic offence (as defined in [section 2(1)][619] of the Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Act 1989) which is not punishable by imprisonment.
    
    (14) Subject to the provisions of any other enactment, where a conviction is entered following proceedings under this section the entry in the Criminal Records kept pursuant to [section 71][108] relating to that conviction and the summary of the facts contained in the notice filed under subsection (2) shall be open to inspection by the public.
    
    (15) Any 2 or more Justices may exercise the powers conferred on a District Court Judge by this section in any case where the minor offence with which the defendant is charged is one in respect of which a court presided over by a Justice or by 2 or more Justices would have jurisdiction if a summons to the defendant were issued in the first instance.

    (1A) If a Registrar receives and records an election under [section 66A(1)][100], the substance of the charge need not be stated to the defendant under subsection (1).
    
    (2) Except in any case in which subsection (7) or [section 66A(1)][100] applies, the court shall, before the charge is gone into in respect of an offence to which this section applies, inform the defendant of the right conferred on him by subsection (1) by causing him to be addressed to the following effect:

    (4) Where a defendant who is charged under this Part with an indictable offence elects under this section to be tried by a jury, the proceedings shall continue as if he had been charged on an information in [form 2][676] of Schedule 2\.

        *   (ii) if any defendant who is a co-accused is to be tried by a jury, that the defendant be tried by a jury instead of the court; and

    (5B) Subsection (5A) is subject to subsection (7).
    
    (6) A defendant who has elected under this section to be tried by a jury may, by leave of the court at any time before he is committed for trial or for sentence, withdraw his election, and thereupon the court may, notwithstanding anything in [section 160][319], [161][321], [184I][370], [184J][372], or [184M][376], deal summarily with the case in all respects as if no such election had been made, and the foregoing provisions of this section shall no longer apply:
    
    provided that where the court is presided over by 2 or more Justices or 1 or more Community Magistrates or a Registrar and the defendant has pleaded guilty to an offence which the court does not have jurisdiction to deal with summarily by reason of its constitution, the court shall record the plea and shall adjourn the proceedings for the defendant to be sentenced or otherwise dealt with by a court presided over by a District Court Judge.
    
    (6A) Where a defendant who has elected under this section to be tried by a jury has pleaded guilty under [sections 184I][370] and [184J][372] and he is not represented by a barrister or solicitor, the court, unless it considers that leave should not be granted to the defendant to withdraw his election, shall draw to his attention the provisions of subsection (6).
    
    (7) Any barrister or solicitor who appears for the defendant may (whether or not the defendant is personally present) inform the court on his behalf that the defendant does not elect to be tried by a jury, or may (where the defendant is personally present) inform the court on his behalf that the defendant does elect to be so tried, and thereupon the court may proceed as if the defendant had personally made the election:
    
    provided that, if it thinks fit, the court may, if the defendant is not personally present and his counsel or solicitor informs the court that the defendant does not elect to be tried by a jury, adjourn the hearing to such time and on such conditions as the court thinks fit to enable the defendant to be present or issue a warrant, in the prescribed form, to arrest him and bring him before the court.

    (4A) A Judge or Registrar must deal with an application under subsection (1) on the papers unless the Judge or Registrar considers that a hearing is necessary.
    
    (4B) While an application under subsection (1) is pending,---

    *   (b) the Registrar must take appropriate steps to ensure that the order is not acted on.
    
    (4C) Despite subsection (4B), if, before an application under subsection (1) is made, any property has been seized under a warrant to seize property to enforce the order to which that application relates,---
        
    *   (a) any seized property that has not been sold, assigned, applied, released, or otherwise disposed of must be retained under [section 100B(3)][197] while the application is pending; or
    
    *   (b) if the seized property has been sold but the proceeds of sale have not been applied in accordance with [section 100N][209] or [100R][213], the proceeds must be retained while the application is pending.
    
    (4D) If the order to which the application relates continues in effect after the application is determined or is discontinued, the property must be dealt with, and any fees and costs payable under an enactment in respect of the property are payable, as if the application had not been made.

    *   (a) [section 21(3)(b), (3D)(b), and (10)(a)][37], if applicable to the case, apply as if the reference to the date of service of the reminder notice were a reference to the date of the direction by the Judge or Registrar; and
    
    *   (b) [section 21(3B), (5)(a), (5A)(a), and (8)(d)][37], if applicable to the case, apply as if the reference to the time when the offence is alleged to have been committed were a reference to the date of the direction by the Judge or Registrar.
    
    (4G) If, under subsection (2)(b), a Judge or Registrar authorises the informant to serve on the defendant a new reminder notice, the defendant may not give notice requesting a hearing in respect of the infringement offence to which the notice relates if the Registrar is satisfied that the notice was filed following the defendant's default in paying 1 or more instalments under an arrangement entered into under [section 21(3A) or (3C)(a)][37].
    
    (4H) If, under subsection (2)(d), an order is set aside following an application made by the informant under subsection (1)(b), the setting aside is not a bar to any other proceedings in the same matter.
    
    (5) If a Judge or Registrar exercises a power under subsection (2)(a), (b), or (c), the order made or deemed to have been made against the defendant ceases to have effect and the Registrar must take appropriate steps to ensure that the order is not acted on.
    
    (6) If a defendant granted a hearing or rehearing under this section does not appear, the court may, if it thinks fit, without hearing or rehearing the matter, direct that the original order be restored.

    (3) In the case of a motor vehicle seized in respect of a traffic fine, the Judge may ask any claimant to satisfy the Judge that any agreement, transfer, or change in registration or ownership is genuine if the Judge has reason to question whether the claimant is a nominee for the defendant or any substitute for the defendant.
    
    (4) A person who claims to have acquired property from the defendant after the commission of any offence or after the taking of any enforcement action against the defendant must satisfy the Judge that the transaction on which the acquisition was based was genuine.

    (3) On an application under subsection (2), the Registrar or a District Court Judge may release the property to the lessor.
    
    (4) Property that is a motor vehicle may also be released under subsection (3) if it has been seized while impounded under [section 96][703] or [96A][704] of the Land Transport Act 1998 even though the 28-day period of impoundment for which the motor vehicle would otherwise be required to be impounded under that Act has not yet expired.

        *   (ii) in the case of a lease for a term of more than 1 year, those proceeds must be applied for the payment to the lessor described in paragraph (a) as if they were payments described in [section 100R(1)(c)][213], and section 100R(2) applied.
        
        
    
    (6) On the release of the proceeds of the sale of the property to the lessor, the lease is cancelled.

    *   (b) where the fine status response does not come within paragraph (a), the Registrar is satisfied that, in providing the credit secured under the security agreement, the secured party relied on that fine status response, and that there are exceptional circumstances that justify that reliance.
    
    (3) If---
        
    *   (a) a fine status response accepted under subsection (2) does disclose a default balance consisting of 1 or more fines; and

    *   (a) that the property be sold at public auction or in any other manner that the Judge or Registrar directs; or

    *   (c) if 1 or more security agreements have been recognised under [section 100J][205] before the proceeds of the sale are fully applied, in payment to each secured party of the amount to which the secured party would, but for the extinguishment of the security interest concerned, have been entitled under that agreement less any applicable default balance certified, under [section 100K][206], in respect of that agreement:

    (4) If the proceeds arise out of the sale of a motor vehicle owned by a substitute for the defendant or in which the substitute had an interest, the proceeds must be applied in the manner and order of priority specified in subsection (1), except that the payments described in paragraphs (d) to (f) of that subsection are limited to amounts imposed in respect of traffic offences committed by the defendant in a motor vehicle that, at the time of the commission of the offence, was owned by the substitute or in which the substitute had an interest.

    (2) The Registrar must---
        
    *   (a) remit the impoundment costs and the costs of the sale of the motor vehicle (as those costs are described in [section 100R(1)(a) and (b)][213]); and
    
    *   (b) remit---
            
        *   (i) the entire fine in default for which the motor vehicle was seized, if the amount of that fine is $100 or less; or
        
        *   (ii) $100 less any proceeds of that sale that have been applied towards paying the fine in default, if the amount of that fine is greater than $100\.
        
        ###### Example
        
        A motor vehicle seized in respect of a fine sells for $350\. The impoundment costs and the costs of the sale of that motor vehicle are $300\. This leaves a balance of $50 to be deducted from the fine. However, the Registrar must remit a further $50 of the fine in order to comply with the requirement for $100 to be deducted from the fine.
    
    (3) The reference to _fine_ in subsection (2)(b) excludes---
        
    *   (a) any reparation that the defendant is liable to pay, other than court costs and other costs that have been added to that reparation; and
    
    *   (b) any offender levy.

    *   (b) the amount or percentage to be deducted from the defendant's salary or wages for the earnings period; and
    
    *   (c) an amount or percentage below which the net amount paid to the defendant for the earnings period must not fall; and
    
    *   (d) that the money due and payable under the fine is, by way of the directed deductions, to be a charge on any salary or wages that from time to time while the attachment order remains in force become due and payable by the employer to the defendant.
    
    (2) The charge created by the attachment order---
        
    *   (a) accrues from earnings period to earnings period, and on a day within, or following, each period that is specified in the attachment order; and
    
    *   (b) attaches to all salary or wages that become due by the employer to the defendant at any time while the attachment order is in force, whether or not the contract of employment in respect of which the salary or wages so become due existed at the date of the attachment order; and
    
    *   (c) prevails over and has priority to any assignment or charge created by the defendant (whether before or after the making of the attachment order against the defendant), so that the attachment order has the same effect as if no such assignment or charge had been made or created.

    (5) The items referred to in subsection (4) are---
        
    *   (a) a deduction notice or an attachment order under the [Child Support Act 1991][732], the [Family Proceedings Act 1980][731], the [Social Security Act 1964][730], or the [Tax Administration Act 1994][733]:

    (7) In this section,---
    
    _net earnings_, in relation to an earnings period, means the balance left after deducting from the defendant's salary or wages for the earnings period the amount of tax required to be withheld or deducted in accordance with the PAYE rules of the [Income Tax Act 2007][793] if the salary or wages were the only salary or wages paid to the defendant by the employer for the earnings period
    
    _protected earnings rate_, in relation to an earnings period, means the higher of---
        
    *   (a) 60% of net earnings for the earnings period; and
    
    *   (b) the amount or percentage stated under subsection (1)(c).

    *   (a) deduct from that money such sum as is sufficient to satisfy the charge on the money so far as the same has accrued before the day on which the salary or wages becomes due and payable; and
    
    *   (b) not later than the 20th day of the month next after the month in which the deduction is made pay the amount so deducted to a person, or into a trust account, in accordance with [section 208][448].
    
    (2) All sums so deducted are hereby deemed to have been paid by the employer in satisfaction of the salary or wages payable by the employer to the defendant.
    
    (3) All sums so deducted are hereby deemed to have been paid by the defendant in satisfaction of the defendant's liability to pay the fine.
    
    (4) If the defendant gives notice of resignation, or is given notice of dismissal, from the employment of the employer to whom the attachment order relates, the employer must, within 7 days after receiving or giving the notice, notify the Registrar of the court in which the attachment order was issued of the date of the last day of the defendant's employment.
    
    (4A) If the employer to whom the attachment order relates ceases to pay salary or wages to the defendant for a reason other than the defendant's dismissal or resignation from the employment of the employer, the employer must, within 7 days after ceasing to pay the salary or wages, notify the Registrar of the court in which the attachment order was issued of the day on which the salary or wages ceased to be paid.
    
    (5) Where the employer makes default in the payment of any money in satisfaction of any such charge, that money shall become a debt due by the employer to the Crown, and may be recovered by the Crown by action in any court of competent jurisdiction.

    *   (b) includes a standard committal, a committal hearing, and any proceedings under [section 160][319], [180][352] or [181][353]
    
    _prosecutor_ has the same meaning as it has in [section 6][838] of the Criminal Disclosure Act 2008
    
    _standard committal_ is a committal that takes place if no oral evidence order has been made under [section 180][352] or [181][353] allowing the oral examination of a witness.

*   (1) Where in any proceedings any conviction, sentence, order, or warrant of a District Court is brought before the High Court, whether on a motion to quash or otherwise, the High Court may, on such terms as to costs and otherwise as it thinks fit, amend the conviction, order, or warrant in any way or may, on such terms as to costs and otherwise as it thinks fit, instead of amending the conviction or order or warrant, remit it for amendment to the District Court by which it was entered, made, or issued, and may thereafter, if it is duly amended, adjudicate upon it as amended.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Summary Proceedings Act 1957\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 2 April 2013, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][1205] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][1206] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][1207] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][1208] and [17E][1209] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
