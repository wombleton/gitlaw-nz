        *   (ii) in the case of a lease for a term of more than 1 year, those proceeds must be applied for the payment to the lessor described in paragraph (a) as if they were payments described in [section 100R(1)(c)][213], and section 100R(2) applied.
        
        
    
    (6) On the release of the proceeds of the sale of the property to the lessor, the lease is cancelled.

    (2) On being satisfied of the authenticity of the evidence presented under subsection (1), the Registrar must accept the fine status response if---

        *   (i) 20 working days before the agreement date; or
        
        *   (ii) 20 working days before the date on which the provision of credit secured under the security agreement was approved, where the Registrar is presented with satisfactory evidence of the date of that approval; or
        
        
    
    *   (b) where the fine status response does not come within paragraph (a), the Registrar is satisfied that, in providing the credit secured under the security agreement, the secured party relied on that fine status response, and that there are exceptional circumstances that justify that reliance.
    
    (3) If---
        
    *   (a) a fine status response accepted under subsection (2) does disclose a default balance consisting of 1 or more fines; and

    *   (a) that the property be sold at public auction or in any other manner that the Judge or Registrar directs; or

    (5) If the Registrar considers that a motor vehicle is not roadworthy and that it would be uneconomic to render it roadworthy, the Registrar must, before the motor vehicle is sold or disposed of under this section, apply, under the [Land Transport Act 1998][530], to have the registration of the motor vehicle cancelled as if the Registrar were the person who, under that Act, is entitled to apply for that cancellation.
    
    (6) The sale of a motor vehicle that has been seized while impounded under [section 96][548] or [96A][549] of the Land Transport Act 1998 is not affected by any appeal that is pending after the 28-day period for which the motor vehicle would otherwise be required to be impounded under that Act, or by any appeal that is determined after that period.
    
    (7) In any case where a motor vehicle has been seized while impounded under [section 96][548] or [96A][549] of the Land Transport Act 1998, the vehicle may be sold under this section (even if the fine and all costs incurred in seizing, towing, and storing the vehicle have been paid) if any impoundment costs are not paid within---

    *   (b) a deposit has not been paid, or security has not been provided, under [section 100F][201].
    
    (10) The purchaser or assignee of property sold or disposed of under this section obtains, by virtue of this section, good title to the property free of all ownership interests and other proprietary interests held in the property before that sale or disposition.

    *   (a) if the property is a motor vehicle that has been impounded under [section 96][548] or [96A][549] of the Land Transport Act 1998, in payment of any impoundment costs:
    
    *   (b) in payment of the costs of the sale (including all costs incurred in seizing, transporting, and storing the property and in complying with the provisions of this Part preliminary to sale):
    
    *   (c) if 1 or more security agreements have been recognised under [section 100J][205] before the proceeds of the sale are fully applied, in payment to each secured party of the amount to which the secured party would, but for the extinguishment of the security interest concerned, have been entitled under that agreement less any applicable default balance certified, under [section 100K][206], in respect of that agreement:
    
    *   (d) in payment of any amount of reparation payable by the defendant:
    
    *   (e) in payment of any offender levy:
    
    *   (f) in payment of the fine specified in the warrant:
    
    *   (g) in payment to any secured party or secured parties of the applicable default balance or the applicable default balances certified under [section 100K][206] and deducted under paragraph (c):
    
    *   (h) in payment of any fees and accident insurance levies prescribed under [section 242(2)(b)][639] of the Land Transport Act 1998 that are outstanding in respect of the vehicle:
    
    *   (i) in payment of any road user charges under [Road User Charges Act 2012][561] that are outstanding in respect of the vehicle:
    
    *   (j) to the defendant or, as the case requires, to the substitute for the defendant.
    
    (2) If any proceeds of sale are required to be applied to 2 or more security interests under subsection (1)(c), those proceeds must be applied in the order of the priority determined for those security interests by [Part 7][642] or [8][643] of the Personal Property Securities Act 1999\.
    
    (3) If any proceeds of sale are required to be applied to 2 or more default balances under subsection (1)(g), those proceeds must be applied to those default balances in the order of the priority determined for the applicable security interests by [Part 7][642] or [8][643] of the Personal Property Securities Act 1999\.
    
    (4) If the proceeds arise out of the sale of a motor vehicle owned by a substitute for the defendant or in which the substitute had an interest, the proceeds must be applied in the manner and order of priority specified in subsection (1), except that the payments described in paragraphs (d) to (f) of that subsection are limited to amounts imposed in respect of traffic offences committed by the defendant in a motor vehicle that, at the time of the commission of the offence, was owned by the substitute or in which the substitute had an interest.
    
    (5) The Judge may, on application or on his or her own initiative, give any directions as to the application of the proceeds of sale under this section.
    
    Section 100R: replaced, on 13 February 2012, by [section 32][635] of the Summary Proceedings Amendment Act 2011 (2011 No 32).

##### 100S Remission of fine and costs of sale in certain cases involving motor vehicles
    
*   (1) This section applies if the realisation under [section 100N][209] or [100P][211] of any motor vehicle seized in respect of a fine does not result in a reduction of the defendant's fine by more than $100\.
    
    (2) The Registrar must---
        
    *   (a) remit the impoundment costs and the costs of the sale of the motor vehicle (as those costs are described in [section 100R(1)(a) and (b)][213]); and
    
    *   (b) remit---
            
        *   (i) the entire fine in default for which the motor vehicle was seized, if the amount of that fine is $100 or less; or
        
        *   (ii) $100 less any proceeds of that sale that have been applied towards paying the fine in default, if the amount of that fine is greater than $100\.
        
        ###### Example
        
        A motor vehicle seized in respect of a fine sells for $350\. The impoundment costs and the costs of the sale of that motor vehicle are $300\. This leaves a balance of $50 to be deducted from the fine. However, the Registrar must remit a further $50 of the fine in order to comply with the requirement for $100 to be deducted from the fine.
    
    (3) The reference to _fine_ in subsection (2)(b) excludes---
        
    *   (a) any reparation that the defendant is liable to pay, other than court costs and other costs that have been added to that reparation; and
    
    *   (b) any offender levy.

    *   (b) the defendant or the substitute had not before the sale notified the Registrar of the person's interest in the property.
    
    (2) If this section applies, a Judge may, on the application of that person, order the defendant to pay to the person compensation in respect of the loss.
    
    (3) Subsection (2) does not limit or affect any other remedy that a person may have in respect of loss referred to in that subsection.

    *   (b) the amount or percentage to be deducted from the defendant's salary or wages for the earnings period; and
    
    *   (c) an amount or percentage below which the net amount paid to the defendant for the earnings period must not fall; and
    
    *   (d) that the money due and payable under the fine is, by way of the directed deductions, to be a charge on any salary or wages that from time to time while the attachment order remains in force become due and payable by the employer to the defendant.
    
    (2) The charge created by the attachment order---
        
    *   (a) accrues from earnings period to earnings period, and on a day within, or following, each period that is specified in the attachment order; and
    
    *   (b) attaches to all salary or wages that become due by the employer to the defendant at any time while the attachment order is in force, whether or not the contract of employment in respect of which the salary or wages so become due existed at the date of the attachment order; and
    
    *   (c) prevails over and has priority to any assignment or charge created by the defendant (whether before or after the making of the attachment order against the defendant), so that the attachment order has the same effect as if no such assignment or charge had been made or created.
    
    (3) Every attachment order applies for a fixed period stated in the order, and must not apply for a period of more than 5 years after the date on which the order is made by the Registrar.
    
    (4) Despite subsections (1) and (2), no attachment order is to operate so that, when its effect is considered either alone or with the effect of any item specified in subsection (5), the net amount paid to a defendant for an earnings period is below the protected earnings rate for the earnings period; and, where necessary, the amount to be deducted from the defendant's salary or wages for the earnings period is treated as being reduced or cancelled accordingly.
    
    (5) The items referred to in subsection (4) are---
        
    *   (a) a deduction notice or an attachment order under the [Child Support Act 1991][583], the [Family Proceedings Act 1980][582], the [Social Security Act 1964][581], or the [Tax Administration Act 1994][584]:

    (7) In this section,---
    
    _net earnings_, in relation to an earnings period, means the balance left after deducting from the defendant's salary or wages for the earnings period the amount of tax required to be withheld or deducted in accordance with the PAYE rules of the [Income Tax Act 2007][652] if the salary or wages were the only salary or wages paid to the defendant by the employer for the earnings period
    
    _protected earnings rate_, in relation to an earnings period, means the higher of---
        
    *   (a) 60% of net earnings for the earnings period; and
    
    *   (b) the amount or percentage stated under subsection (1)(c).

    *   (a) deduct from that money such sum as is sufficient to satisfy the charge on the money so far as the same has accrued before the day on which the salary or wages becomes due and payable; and
    
    *   (b) not later than the 20th day of the month next after the month in which the deduction is made pay the amount so deducted to a person, or into a trust account, in accordance with [section 208][451].
    
    (2) All sums so deducted are hereby deemed to have been paid by the employer in satisfaction of the salary or wages payable by the employer to the defendant.
    
    (3) All sums so deducted are hereby deemed to have been paid by the defendant in satisfaction of the defendant's liability to pay the fine.
    
    (4) If the defendant gives notice of resignation, or is given notice of dismissal, from the employment of the employer to whom the attachment order relates, the employer must, within 7 days after receiving or giving the notice, notify the Registrar of the court in which the attachment order was issued of the date of the last day of the defendant's employment.
    
    (4A) If the employer to whom the attachment order relates ceases to pay salary or wages to the defendant for a reason other than the defendant's dismissal or resignation from the employment of the employer, the employer must, within 7 days after ceasing to pay the salary or wages, notify the Registrar of the court in which the attachment order was issued of the day on which the salary or wages ceased to be paid.
    
    (5) Where the employer makes default in the payment of any money in satisfaction of any such charge, that money shall become a debt due by the employer to the Crown, and may be recovered by the Crown by action in any court of competent jurisdiction.
