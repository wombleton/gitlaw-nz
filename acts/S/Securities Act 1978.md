    *   (ab) in the case of a security that is offered in a simplified disclosure prospectus,---
            
        *   (i) the subscriber did not receive, before subscribing for the security, a copy of---
                
            *   (A) that simplified disclosure prospectus; and
            
            *   (B) every instrument that amends that prospectus that is registered under [section 43][113] before the time of allotment; or
            
            
        
        *   (ii) the FMA made a delayed allotment order in relation to that simplified disclosure prospectus and the subscriber subscribed for the security before the delayed allotment order was made; or
        
        
    
    *   (b) at the time of allotment, the investment statement or registered prospectus relating to the security is known by the issuer of the security, or any director of the issuer, to be false or misleading in a material particular by reason of failing to refer, or give proper emphasis, to adverse circumstances (whether or not the investment statement or registered prospectus became so false or misleading as a result of a change of circumstances occurring after the date of the investment statement or registered prospectus); or
    
    *   (c) the date of allotment would be more than,---
            
        *   (i) where the registered prospectus relating to the security contains or refers to a statement of financial position or interim statement of financial position in accordance with regulations and no certificate has been registered in relation to that prospectus under subsection (1A), 9 months after the date of that statement of financial position or interim statement of financial position (whichever is the later); or
        
        *   (ii) where the registered prospectus relating to the security contains or refers to a statement of financial position (but not an interim statement of financial position) in accordance with regulations and a certificate has been registered in relation to that prospectus under subsection (1A), 9 months after the date of that certificate; or

    *   (d) in the case of an equity security, debt security, or participatory security, after the allotment, the total amount of securities allotted under the registered prospectus relating to the security would (after deducting, in the case of an allotment of debt securities, the total amount of debt securities of the issuer redeemed since the date of the registered prospectus) exceed the amount specified in the registered prospectus as the maximum amount that will be so allotted.
    
    (1AA) However, subsection (1)(a) does not apply to securities that are offered in a simplified disclosure prospectus.
    
    (1A) For the purposes of subsection (1)(c), if no interim statement of financial position is contained or referred to in a registered prospectus, an issuer may deliver to the Registrar for registration under this Act, and the Registrar shall register, a certificate that relates to the registered prospectus and that---
        
    *   (a) is signed on behalf of all the directors by at least 2 directors of the issuer (or, where the issuer has only 1 director, by that director); and
    
    *   (b) is dated no later than 9 months after the date of the statement of financial position contained or referred to in the registered prospectus; and

        *   (ii) the registered prospectus is not, at the date of the certificate, false or misleading in a material particular by reason of failing to refer, or give proper emphasis, to adverse circumstances; and
        
        
    
    *   (d) where the registered prospectus relates to equity securities, debt securities, or participatory securities, is accompanied by financial statements---
            
        *   (i) for the 6-month period from the date of the statement of financial position referred to in paragraph (b); and
        
        *   (ii) prepared in accordance with regulations as if they were required to be contained or referred to in a registered prospectus for those securities, except that they need not be audited.
        
        
    
    (2) \[Repealed\]
    
    (3) An allotment made in contravention of this section is (whether or not the issuer is in liquidation) voidable at the instance of the subscriber by notice in writing to the issuer at any time within the prescribed period.
    
    (4) For the purpose of subsection (3), _prescribed period_ means---
        
    *   (a) a period of 1 year after the security or a certificate of the security has been sent to the subscriber; or
    
    *   (b) a period of 6 months after the subscriber knows, or ought reasonably to know, that the allotment was made in contravention of the provisions of this section---
    
    whichever is the lesser.
    
    (5) Without limiting any enactment or rule of law, an allotment made in contravention of this section shall be valid unless notice avoiding the allotment is given by the subscriber in accordance with subsection (3).
    
    (6) Where an allotment made in contravention of this section is avoided by the subscriber under subsection (3), the issuer shall forthwith upon receiving notice under that subsection, repay the subscriptions to the subscriber.
    
    (7) If such subscriptions are not so repaid within 1 month after the date of the receipt by the issuer of notice under subsection (3), the issuer and all the directors thereof shall be jointly and severally liable to repay the subscriptions with interest at a rate prescribed from time to time by regulations made under this Act from the date on which such notice was received:
    
    provided that a director shall not be so liable if he or she proves that the default in the repayment of the subscriptions was not due to any misconduct or negligence on his or her part.

##### 44AD Effect of delayed allotment orders
    
*   (1) No allotment of a security that is offered in a simplified disclosure prospectus to which a delayed allotment order applies may be made---
        
    *   (a) in contravention of the terms or conditions of the delayed allotment order or of its revocation; or
    
    *   (b) if a term or condition of the delayed allotment order remains unfulfilled; or
    
    *   (c) until after the delayed allotment order expires or is revoked.
    
    (2) If a person contravenes subsection (1), [section 37(1A)(b) and (4) to (7)][86] apply (which provide that an allotment of a security that is offered in a simplified disclosure prospectus in contravention of subsection (1) is invalid and of no effect).
    
    (3) If the FMA makes a delayed allotment order and a subscriber has subscribed for a security that is offered in a simplified disclosure prospectus to which that delayed allotment order applies before the FMA made the delayed allotment order, [section 37A(1)(ab)(ii) and (3) to (8)][86] apply (which provide that an allotment of a security in those circumstances is voidable at the instance of the subscriber by notice in writing).
    
    ###### Example
    
    Issuer A makes an offer of securities to the public for subscription in a simplified disclosure prospectus. Tom subscribes for some of those securities. After Tom has subscribed for the securities, the FMA makes a delayed allotment order that applies to the simplified disclosure prospectus. Section 37A(1)(ab)(ii) and (3) to (8) apply.
    
    In these circumstances, Issuer A's options may include the following:
        
    *   (a) Issuer A may ask Tom if he wants to resubscribe for the securities. In this case, Issuer A could obtain Tom's permission to use the money that Tom paid Issuer A when he originally subscribed for the securities (**Tom's subscription money**) to resubscribe for those securities after the date on which the delayed allotment order was made. Issuer A may then allot those securities to Tom (once the delayed allotment order has expired or has been revoked) without contravening section 37A(1)(ab)(ii); or
    
    *   (b) Issuer A could withdraw the offer or take some other similar course of action. If Issuer A withdraws the offer it must pay Tom's subscription money back to him. Tom's subscription money must be held in trust for him until it is repaid (_see_ section 36A); or
    
    *   (c) Issuer A could allot the securities to Tom (once the delayed allotment order has expired or has been revoked) without Tom having resubscribed for the securities. In this case, the allotment would be valid (_see_ section 37A(5)), but it is voidable at the instance of Tom (_see_ section 37A(3)) and Issuer A has committed an offence (_see_ sections 37A(1)(ab)(ii) and 59(1)).
    
    Tom's options include the following:
        
    *   (a) Tom may decide to leave Tom's subscription money with Issuer A and use that money to resubscribe for the securities. If Issuer A agrees to this, Issuer A may allot those securities to Tom (once the delayed allotment order has expired or has been revoked) without contravening section 37A(1)(ab)(ii); or
    
    *   (b) Tom may require Issuer A to pay Tom's subscription money back to him. Tom's subscription money must be held in trust for him until it is repaid (_see_ section 36A); or
    
    *   (c) Tom may decide to take no action at all. In this case, if Issuer A allots the securities to Tom (once the delayed allotment order has expired or has been revoked), the allotment would be valid (_see_ section 37A(5)), but it is voidable at the instance of Tom (_see_ section 37A(3)) and Issuer A has committed an offence (_see_ sections 37A(1)(ab)(ii) and 59(1)). If Issuer A does not allot the securities to Tom, Issuer A must pay Tom's subscription money back to him (_see_ section 36A).
    
    Regardless of which option is taken by Issuer A or Tom, if Issuer A allots securities to Tom in contravention of section 44AD(1) (for example, by allotting the securities to Tom before the delayed allotment order has expired or has been revoked), that allotment is invalid and of no effect (_see_ sections 44AD(1), (2), and (4) and 37(1A)(b) and (4) to (7)) and Issuer A has committed offences (_see_ sections 59(1) and 60(2)).
    
    (4) Subsections (1) and (2) override subsection (3).
    
    (5) This section applies despite anything in the terms of the offer.

    *   (a) to take and to retain possession of all property, whatsoever and wheresoever situated, of the defaulting broker and his or her nominee company relating to the contributory mortgages which were being managed by the defaulting broker (in this section called the _mortgages_) and to hold and administer that property for the benefit of the contributors to the mortgages in their respective rights and interests:
    
    *   (b) to demand and receive all money payable to the defaulting broker on account of the mortgages:
    
    *   (c) to sue for and recover all debts due and other money payable to the defaulting broker on account of the mortgages:
    
    *   (d) to pay over, in the discretion of the appointee, and in such manner and to such extent as he or she thinks fit, any money received by him or her in his or her capacity as appointee, whether arising from real or personal property and whether capital or income, for any purpose for or to which the defaulting broker might lawfully have applied that money:
    
    *   (e) to carry out and perform contracts relating to the mortgages entered into by the defaulting broker before the appointment of the appointee:
    
    *   (f) to take any such action, including, without limitation, actions at law or in equity, to enforce the rights of the mortgagee under the mortgages:

    *   (h) to do all acts and to execute, in the name of the defaulting broker all deeds, receipts, and other documents, and for that purpose to use, when necessary, the seal of the defaulting broker (if any).
    
    (2) The appointee may, at any time, in his or her discretion apply to the court _ex parte_ for directions with respect to the exercise of his or her powers, and the court may, on any such application, make such order as the court thinks fit.
    
    (3) The court may, on application of the appointee, enlarge the powers of the appointee in such manner as it thinks fit.
    
    (4) It shall be the duty of all persons having possession or control of any documents or other property, whatsoever and wheresoever situated, belonging to the defaulting broker and relating to the mortgages, forthwith after the appointment of the appointee to yield up the same to the appointee.
    
    (5) The appointee shall not be liable for any acts or omissions by him or her in good faith in the exercise of his or her powers under this section, and no action or proceeding shall be commenced against the appointee except by leave of the court and subject to such terms and conditions as the court may impose.

    provided that no such order shall deprive any other person of any estate or interest in the property if the estate or interest was acquired in good faith and for valuable consideration.

    *   (b) must make a declaration of civil liability if satisfied of those matters (_see_ [sections 55D][186] and [55E][187]); and
    
    *   (c) may order the person to pay to the Crown a pecuniary penalty that the court considers appropriate (_see_ [section 55F][188]) if satisfied of those matters and that the civil liability event---

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Securities Act 1978\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 July 2013, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][585] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][586] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][587] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][588] and [17E][589] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
