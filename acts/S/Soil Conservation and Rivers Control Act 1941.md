##### 30A Land improvement agreements
    
*   (1) Every land improvement agreement under subsection (3) of [section 30][38] shall be in a form approved by the Minister, either for a specific transaction or generally for a particular class of transactions, specifying the obligations of the parties in respect of work and payment, and including a covenant by the owner or occupier binding himself and his successors in title to perform and observe the terms and conditions upon which the grant or loan was made.
    
    (2) Where in the opinion of the Minister such a course is appropriate, any land improvement agreement may relate portions of a grant to specified works, or to specified periods of maintenance, or to the application of particular farming practices during specified periods; and may provide for any sum repayable upon default to be diminished in proportion to the extent to which the agreement has been performed or observed.
    
    (3) Where the owner or occupier of any land has entered into a land improvement agreement, that agreement may be registered against the title of that owner or occupier to the whole or any part of the land to which the agreement relates. Registration of a land improvement agreement may be effected by depositing with the Registrar a duplicate of the agreement, certified under the hand of the authorised officer specified in subsection (14), together with an application for the registration of the agreement, which application shall be signed by the authorised officer and shall specify the land against which it is desired to register the agreement, and shall certify that the agreement is one that may be registered against the land under this section. On receipt of the duplicate agreement and application as aforesaid, and on payment of a fee of 50c, the Registrar shall enter a memorial of the agreement upon the register against the title to the land of the owner or occupier who is a party to the agreement specified in the application. In any such case it shall not be necessary for the Registrar to record the like memorial on the duplicate certificate of title or lease. The memorial may sufficiently describe the agreement as a land improvement agreement under the Soil Conservation and Rivers Control Act 1941\.
    
    (4) Any land improvement agreement which varies or is in substitution for an earlier land improvement agreement (whether that agreement is registered or not) may be registered under this section.
    
    (5) On the expiration or termination, either in whole or in part, of a registered land improvement agreement the authorised officer shall sign a certificate to that effect and deposit it with the Registrar, who shall thereupon without fee enter a memorial of the expiration or termination on the register against the appropriate title.
    
    (6) While the land improvement agreement is registered against the title of any owner or occupier to any land, and until the expiry of the agreement by effluxion of time or (where the agreement is registered against the title of a lessee) the sooner determination of the lease and every renewal thereof by effluxion of time or otherwise, the agreement shall run at law with the land against the title to which it is registered, so as to confer and impose upon every person who at the date of registration of the agreement, or at any time thereafter, is for the time being the occupier of that land or of any part thereof, a right to enforce and an obligation to observe and perform the agreement during the period of his occupancy of the land or of any part thereof in the same manner as if the occupier had been a party to the agreement. Where there are 2 or more such occupiers, the obligation and liability so imposed on them shall be borne by them in such manner as the Minister and those occupiers may agree or in default of agreement shall be borne by those occupiers jointly.
    
    (7) Where the lessee for the time being under any lease of the land or of any part thereof surrenders his lease and obtains a new lease in exchange therefor, the land improvement agreement and the provisions of this Act shall continue to apply as if the new lease were a renewal of the surrendered lease.
    
    (8) Where the lessee for the time being under any lease of the land or any part thereof obtains a title in fee simple to the land or any part thereof, the land improvement agreement and the provisions of this Act shall continue to apply to the land to which the title in fee simple has been obtained as if the agreement, so far as it affects that land, had been made with the legal owner in fee simple of the land.
    
    (9) No land improvement agreement which runs with the land in accordance with this section shall confer any right or impose any obligation on any party to the agreement or any occupier of the land, except in respect of the period of his occupation of the land.
    
    (10) If at any time there is default in the observance or performance of any of the obligations in respect of the land which are specified in the land improvement agreement, the authorised officer may, on payment of a fee of 50c, deposit with the Registrar a certificate under his hand specifying the amount payable and unpaid under the agreement in respect of the default by any owner or occupier of the land and the registered estate or interest of that owner or occupier in any land against the title to which the agreement is registered, and the Registrar shall thereupon register the certificate in respect of the said estate or interest of that owner or occupier.
    
    (11) Upon registration of the certificate, the amount mentioned therein, and all money which after the signing of the certificate and before the release thereof accrues due by that owner or occupier under the land improvement agreement, shall, until payment thereof, be a charge on the said estate or interest in the land of that owner or occupier. Every charge in respect of which a certificate is registered under subsection (10) shall have priority in relation to all other transactions affecting the land as if it had been registered at the time when the land improvement agreement was registered under subsection (3).
    
    (12) Where any occupier has an interest in the land as lessee under a lease, the charge shall extend to the interest (if any) of the lessee in any improvements to the land and in any money that may be payable by the lessor and by an incoming tenant and otherwise for any such improvements, whether during the term of the lease or thereafter.
    
    (13) For the purpose of enforcing any charge under this section, the High Court or a Judge thereof may make such order as he or it thinks fit, either for the sale of the estate or interest which is subject to a charge, or for the appointment of a receiver or otherwise; and any order for sale shall be carried into effect by the Sheriff in the same manner as in the case of a writ for sale, with any modifications that may be necessary or may be provided by rules of court in that behalf:
    
    provided that, in the case of Maori freehold land within the meaning of the Maori Affairs Act 1953, the charge shall be enforceable only by the appointment of a receiver in accordance with section 33 of that Act and subsections (3) to (5) of that section shall apply to the receiver so appointed.
    
    (14) For the purposes of this section, unless the context otherwise requires,---
        
    *   (a) all land which is not otherwise occupied shall be deemed to be in the occupation of the owner in fee simple thereof:
    
    *   (b) _authorised officer_ means---
            
        *   (i) the Minister; or

    *   (c) _lease_ means a registered lease and any lease or licence, registered or unregistered, from the Crown, including a registered or unregistered licence from the Crown to occupy any land pending the completion of the purchase of that land under a system of deferred payment:
    
    *   (d) _Registrar_, in relation to any land (including the land comprised in a mining privilege that is registered under the [Land Transfer Act 1952][280]), means the District Land Registrar or the Registrar of Deeds, as the case may require, for the land registration district within which the land is situated; and, in relation to any land comprised in a mining privilege that is not registered under the Land Transfer Act 1952, or in relation to a coal mining lease or coal mining right under the Coal Mines Act 1925 that is recorded in the office of a Mining Registrar, means the Mining Registrar in whose office the mining privilege or lease or right is registered or recorded.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Soil Conservation and Rivers Control Act 1941\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 July 2013, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][348] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][349] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][350] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][351] and [17E][352] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
