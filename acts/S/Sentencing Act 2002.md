#### Purposes and principles of sentencing

##### 7 Purposes of sentencing or otherwise dealing with offenders
    
*   (1) The purposes for which a court may sentence or otherwise deal with an offender are---
        
    *   (a) to hold the offender accountable for harm done to the victim and the community by the offending; or
    
    *   (b) to promote in the offender a sense of responsibility for, and an acknowledgment of, that harm; or
    
    *   (c) to provide for the interests of the victim of the offence; or
    
    *   (d) to provide reparation for harm done by the offending; or
    
    *   (e) to denounce the conduct in which the offender was involved; or
    
    *   (f) to deter the offender or other persons from committing the same or a similar offence; or
    
    *   (g) to protect the community from the offender; or
    
    *   (h) to assist in the offender's rehabilitation and reintegration; or
    
    *   (i) a combination of 2 or more of the purposes in paragraphs (a) to (h).
    
    (2) To avoid doubt, nothing about the order in which the purposes appear in this section implies that any purpose referred to must be given greater weight than any other purpose referred to.

##### 8 Principles of sentencing or otherwise dealing with offenders
    
*   In sentencing or otherwise dealing with an offender the court---
        
    *   (a) must take into account the gravity of the offending in the particular case, including the degree of culpability of the offender; and
    
    *   (b) must take into account the seriousness of the type of offence in comparison with other types of offences, as indicated by the maximum penalties prescribed for the offences; and
    
    *   (c) must impose the maximum penalty prescribed for the offence if the offending is within the most serious of cases for which that penalty is prescribed, unless circumstances relating to the offender make that inappropriate; and
    
    *   (d) must impose a penalty near to the maximum prescribed for the offence if the offending is near to the most serious of cases for which that penalty is prescribed, unless circumstances relating to the offender make that inappropriate; and
    
    *   (e) must take into account the general desirability of consistency with appropriate sentencing levels and other means of dealing with offenders in respect of similar offenders committing similar offences in similar circumstances; and
    
    *   (f) must take into account any information provided to the court concerning the effect of the offending on the victim; and
    
    *   (g) must impose the least restrictive outcome that is appropriate in the circumstances, in accordance with the hierarchy of sentences and orders set out in [section 10A][18]; and
    
    *   (h) must take into account any particular circumstances of the offender that mean that a sentence or other means of dealing with the offender that would otherwise be appropriate would, in the particular instance, be disproportionately severe; and
    
    *   (i) must take into account the offender's personal, family, whanau, community, and cultural background in imposing a sentence or other means of dealing with the offender with a partly or wholly rehabilitative purpose; and
    
    *   (j) must take into account any outcomes of restorative justice processes that have occurred, or that the court is satisfied are likely to occur, in relation to the particular case (including, without limitation, anything referred to in [section 10][16]).
    
    Section 8(g): amended, on 1 October 2007, by [section 6(2)][436] of the Sentencing Amendment Act 2007 (2007 No 27).

        *   (i) the hostility is because of the common characteristic; and
        
        *   (ii) the offender believed that the victim has that characteristic:
        
        
    
    *   (ha) that the offence was committed as part of, or involves, a terrorist act (as defined in [section 5(1)][437] of the Terrorism Suppression Act 2002):
    
    *   (hb) the nature and extent of any connection between the offending and the offender's---
            
        *   (i) participation in an organised criminal group (within the meaning of [section 98A][438] of the Crimes Act 1961); or
        
        *   (ii) involvement in any other form of organised criminal association:
        
        
    
    *   (i) premeditation on the part of the offender and, if so, the level of premeditation involved:
    
    *   (j) the number, seriousness, date, relevance, and nature of any previous convictions of the offender and of any convictions for which the offender is being sentenced or otherwise dealt with at the same time:
    
    *   (k) any failure by the offender personally (or failure by the offender's lawyer arising out of the offender's instructions to, or failure or refusal to co-operate with, his or her lawyer) to comply with a procedural requirement that, in the court's opinion, has done either or both of the following:
            
        *   (i) caused a delay in the disposition of the proceedings:
        
        *   (ii) had an adverse effect on a victim or witness.

    *   (h) that the offender spent time on bail with an EM condition as defined in [section 3][439] of the Bail Act 2000\.
    
    (3) Despite subsection (2)(e), the court must not take into account by way of mitigation the fact that the offender was, at the time of committing the offence, affected by the voluntary consumption or use of alcohol or any drug or other substance (other than a drug or other substance used for bona fide medical purposes).
    
    (3A) In taking into account that the offender spent time on bail with an EM condition under subsection (2)(h), the court must consider---
        
    *   (a) the period of time that the offender spent on bail with an EM condition; and
    
    *   (b) the relative restrictiveness of the EM condition, particularly the frequency and duration of the offender's authorised absences from the electronic monitoring address; and
    
    *   (c) the offender's compliance with the bail conditions during the period of bail with an EM condition; and
    
    *   (d) any other relevant matter.

    *   (a) prevents the court from taking into account any other aggravating or mitigating factor that the court thinks fit; or

    *   (a) ambulance services, first aid, or medical or paramedical care:
    
    *   (b) services provided by or on behalf of a fire brigade (as defined in [section 2(1)][440] of the Fire Service Act 1975) to save life or property.
    
    (5) In this section, _procedural requirement_ means a requirement imposed by or under---

    *   (b) the type of information referred to in a reparation report is available through other means (including, without limitation, a declaration made following a direction under [section 41][64]); or

    (2) An offender who is subject to a sentence of reparation or a Registrar may apply in accordance with [section 72][136] for an order under subsection (1) on the ground that the reparation is unaffordable because the offender's financial position has changed significantly since the sentence was imposed.
    
    (3) A Registrar may apply in accordance with [section 72][136] for an order under subsection (1) on the ground that the Registrar reasonably believes that the sentence is unenforceable because the offender provided false or misleading information about the offender's financial position that the court relied on in imposing the sentence or because of any other reason.
    
    (4) The court may make an order under subsection (1) (whether on application or on its own initiative) only if---

    (5) If the court is considering a substitute sentence,---
        
    *   (a) the court must take the following matters into account:

        *   (ii) any other sentences or orders imposed on the offender for the offending for which the original reparation was imposed and the extent to which the reparation was taken into account in imposing those sentences or orders; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) if the offender provided false or misleading information about the offender's financial position, the court may take the following matters into account:
            
        *   (i) the extent to which the information was false or misleading:

    (6) If the court cancels a sentence of reparation, the amount of reparation outstanding is deemed to be remitted from the date the order is made or any other date that the court may specify.

##### 39 Power to impose fine instead of imprisonment, sentence of home detention, or community-based sentence

    (3) It is not necessary for all the periods of work to be of the same duration, but no period may be longer than 10 hours and no offender may be required to do more than 40 hours of community work per week.

    (3) For the purposes of subsection (2), a person who is detained under an interim recall order under the [Parole Act 2002][573] is not detained under the sentence to which the interim recall order applies.
    
    (4) An indeterminate sentence of imprisonment must not be imposed cumulatively on any other sentence.
    
    (5) Any sentence of imprisonment may be imposed concurrently with any other sentence of imprisonment.
    
    (6) For the purpose of this section, a term of imprisonment imposed on an offender (whether by committal, sentence, or order) in respect of the non-payment of a sum of money, contempt of court, or disobedience of a court order is deemed to be a determinate sentence of imprisonment.

    Section 83(2): substituted, on 7 July 2004, by [section 6][575] of the Sentencing Amendment Act 2004 (2004 No 68).

##### 84 Guidance on use of cumulative and concurrent sentences of imprisonment
    
*   (1) Cumulative sentences of imprisonment are generally appropriate if the offences for which an offender is being sentenced are different in kind, whether or not they are a connected series of offences.
    
    (2) Concurrent sentences of imprisonment are generally appropriate if the offences for which an offender is being sentenced are of a similar kind and are a connected series of offences.
    
    (3) In determining for the purpose of this section whether 2 or more offences committed by 1 offender are a connected series of offences, the court may consider---
        
    *   (a) the time at which they occurred; or
    
    *   (b) the overall nature of the offending; or
    
    *   (c) any other relationship between the offences that the court considers relevant.
    
    

##### 85 Court to consider totality of offending
    
*   (1) Subject to this section, if a court is considering imposing sentences of imprisonment for 2 or more offences, the individual sentences must reflect the seriousness of each offence.
    
    (2) If cumulative sentences of imprisonment are imposed, whether individually or in combination with concurrent sentences, they must not result in a total period of imprisonment wholly out of proportion to the gravity of the overall offending.
    
    (3) If, because of the need to ensure that the total term of cumulative sentences is not disproportionately long, the imposition of cumulative sentences would result in a series of short sentences that individually fail to reflect the seriousness of each offence, then longer concurrent sentences, or a combination of concurrent and cumulative sentences, must be preferred.
    
    (4) If only concurrent sentences are to be imposed,---
        
    *   (a) the most serious offence must, subject to any maximum penalty provided for that offence, receive the penalty that is appropriate for the totality of the offending; and
    
    *   (b) each of the lesser offences must receive the penalty appropriate to that offence.
    
    

#### Imposition of minimum period of imprisonment in relation to determinate sentence of imprisonment

##### 86 Imposition of minimum period of imprisonment in relation to determinate sentence of imprisonment
    
*   (1) If a court sentences an offender to a determinate sentence of imprisonment of more than 2 years for a particular offence, it may, at the same time as it sentences the offender, order that the offender serve a minimum period of imprisonment in relation to that particular sentence.
    
    (2) The court may impose a minimum period of imprisonment that is longer than the period otherwise applicable under [section 84(1)][576] of the Parole Act 2002 if it is satisfied that that period is insufficient for all or any of the following purposes:
        
    *   (a) holding the offender accountable for the harm done to the victim and the community by the offending:
    
    *   (b) denouncing the conduct in which the offender was involved:
    
    *   (c) deterring the offender or other persons from committing the same or a similar offence:
    
    *   (d) protecting the community from the offender.
    
    (3) \[Repealed\]
    
    (4) A minimum period of imprisonment imposed under this section must not exceed the lesser of---
        
    *   (a) two-thirds of the full term of the sentence; or
    
    *   (b) 10 years.
    
    (5) For the purposes of [Part 6][566] of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011, an order under this section is a sentence.

    (7) The court must give the offender a written notice that sets out the consequences if the offender is convicted of any serious violent offence committed after the warning given under subsection (1)(a).

*   (1) Despite any other enactment,---
        
    *   (a) a proceeding against a defendant charged with a stage-3 offence must be transferred to the High Court when the proceeding is adjourned for trial or trial callover under [section 57][608] of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011 or, as the case may be, in accordance with [section 36][609] of that Act, and the proceeding from that point, including the trial, must be in the High Court; and
    
    *   (b) no court other than the High Court, or the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court on an appeal, may sentence an offender for a stage-3 offence.

    (3) When the court sentences the offender under subsection (2), the court must order that the offender serve the sentence without parole unless the court is satisfied that, given the circumstances of the offence and the offender, it would be manifestly unjust to make the order.
    
    (4) Despite subsection (3), if the court sentences the offender for manslaughter, the court must order that the offender serve a minimum period of imprisonment of not less than 20 years unless the court considers that, given the circumstances of the offence and the offender, a minimum period of that duration would be manifestly unjust, in which case the court must order that the offender serve a minimum period of imprisonment of not less than 10 years.
    
    (5) If the court does not make an order under subsection (3) or, where subsection (4) applies, does not order a minimum period of not less than 20 years under subsection (4), the court must give written reasons for not doing so.

    (7) Despite subsection (2), this section does not preclude the court from imposing, under [section 87][209], a sentence of preventive detention on the offender, and if the court imposes such a sentence on the offender,---

    *   (b) the minimum period of imprisonment that the court imposes on the offender under [section 89(1)][211] must not be less than the term of imprisonment that the court would have imposed under subsection (2), unless the court is satisfied that, given the circumstances of the offence and the offender, the imposition of that minimum period would be manifestly unjust.
    
    (8) If, in reliance on subsection (7)(b), the court imposes a minimum period of imprisonment that is less than the term of imprisonment that the court would have imposed under subsection (2), the court must give written reasons for doing so.

    *   (b) that murder is a stage-2 offence or a stage-3 offence.
    
    (2) If this section applies, the court must---
        
    *   (a) sentence the offender to imprisonment for life for that murder; and

    (3) If the court does not make an order under subsection (2)(b), the court must give written reasons for not doing so.
    
    (4) If the court does not make an order under subsection (2)(b), the court must,---
        
    *   (a) if that murder is a stage-3 offence, impose a minimum period of imprisonment of not less than 20 years unless the court is satisfied that, given the circumstances of the offence and the offender, it would be manifestly unjust to do so; and
    
    *   (b) if that murder is a stage-2 offence, or if the court is satisfied that a minimum period of imprisonment of not less than 20 years under paragraph (a) would be manifestly unjust, order that the offender serve a minimum period of imprisonment in accordance with [section 103][233].
    
    (5) If, in the case of a stage-3 offence, the court imposes under subsection (4)(a) a minimum period of imprisonment of less than 20 years, the court must give written reasons for doing so.
    
    (6) If, in the case of a stage-2 offence, the court makes an order under subsection (4)(b) and the offender does not, at the time of sentencing, have a record of final warning, the court must---
        
    *   (a) warn the offender of the consequences if the offender is convicted of any serious violent offence committed after that warning; and

##### 86F Continuing effect of warnings
    
*   (1) An offender continues to have a record of first warning or a record of final warning regardless of whether the offender has served or otherwise completed the sentence imposed on the offender for the offence (including, without limitation, any sentence imposed under [section 86D][202] or [86E][203]) to which the record relates.
    
    (2) However, an offender ceases to have a record of first warning or a record of final warning if, on an appeal, an appellate court---
        
    *   (a) quashes all the convictions to which the relevant record relates; and
    
    *   (b) does not replace 1 or more of those quashed convictions with a conviction for another serious violent offence.
    
    (3) If the appellate court quashes a conviction to which a record of first warning or a record of final warning relates, the appellate court must order that the record of the warning be cancelled in respect of that conviction.
    
    (4) If the appellate court replaces a conviction (the _quashed conviction_) to which a record of first warning or a record of final warning relates with a conviction for another serious violent offence (the _substituted conviction_), then any record of first warning or final warning that previously related to the quashed conviction is deemed---
        
    *   (a) to relate to the substituted conviction; and
    
    *   (b) to have taken effect on the date on which the record that related to the quashed conviction took effect.
    
    (5) If, in accordance with subsection (2), an offender has ceased to have a record of first warning but continues to have a record of final warning, then---
        
    *   (a) the appellate court must order that a record of first warning replace that record of final warning; and
    
    *   (b) that replacement record of first warning is deemed to have taken effect on the date on which the record of final warning took effect.
    
    (6) Subsection (3) is subject to subsection (4).

##### 86G Consequences of cancellation of record on later sentences
    
*   (1) This section applies where,---
        
    *   (a) in accordance with [section 86F(2)][204], an offender ceases to have a record of first warning or a record of final warning or both (the _previous record_); and
    
    *   (b) the offender continues to be subject to a sentence (a _later sentence_) that was imposed on the offender under any of [sections 86C][201], [86D][202], or [86E][203] for serious violent offences committed when the offender had the previous record.
    
    (2) The appellate court must take the actions described in this section that are applicable to the case or remit the matter to the court that sentenced the offender with a direction to take those actions.
    
    (3) The appropriate court must take the following actions:
        
    *   (a) if the later sentence would not have been imposed but for the previous record, the court must set aside the later sentence and replace it with a sentence that the court would have imposed had the offender not been subject to the previous record:
    
    *   (b) if any order relating to the later sentence would not have been made but for the previous record, the court must cancel the order and, where appropriate, replace it with an order that the court would have made had the offender not been subject to the previous record:
    
    *   (c) if the court considers it just to make any consequential orders, the court must make those orders.
    
    (4) Without limiting the generality of subsection (3), if an offender who continues to be subject to a later sentence for 1 or more stage-2 offences ceases, in accordance with [section 86F(2)][204], to have a record of first warning, the appropriate court must---
        
    *   (a) cancel any order imposed on the offender in respect of those stage-2 offences under [section 86C(4)][201]; and
    
    *   (b) if the court considers it appropriate to do so, impose a minimum period of imprisonment under [section 86][197] in respect of those stage-2 offences, taking into account any indication given by the sentencing court under [section 86C(6)][201]; and
    
    *   (c) in the case of a stage-2 offence that is murder, cancel any sentence or order imposed on the offender under [section 86E(2)][203] and re-sentence the offender under [subpart 4][610] of this Part.
    
    (5) Without limiting the generality of subsection (3), if an offender who continues to be subject to a later sentence for stage-3 offences ceases, in accordance with [section 86F(2)][204], to have either a record of first warning or a record of final warning, the appropriate court must,---
        
    *   (a) if the offender has been sentenced under [section 86D][202], re-sentence the offender for the offence concerned by applying [section 86C][201]; and
