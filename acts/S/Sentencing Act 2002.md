#### Purposes and principles of sentencing

##### 7 Purposes of sentencing or otherwise dealing with offenders
    
*   (1) The purposes for which a court may sentence or otherwise deal with an offender are---
        
    *   (a) to hold the offender accountable for harm done to the victim and the community by the offending; or
    
    *   (b) to promote in the offender a sense of responsibility for, and an acknowledgment of, that harm; or
    
    *   (c) to provide for the interests of the victim of the offence; or
    
    *   (d) to provide reparation for harm done by the offending; or
    
    *   (e) to denounce the conduct in which the offender was involved; or
    
    *   (f) to deter the offender or other persons from committing the same or a similar offence; or
    
    *   (g) to protect the community from the offender; or
    
    *   (h) to assist in the offender's rehabilitation and reintegration; or
    
    *   (i) a combination of 2 or more of the purposes in paragraphs (a) to (h).
    
    (2) To avoid doubt, nothing about the order in which the purposes appear in this section implies that any purpose referred to must be given greater weight than any other purpose referred to.

##### 8 Principles of sentencing or otherwise dealing with offenders
    
*   In sentencing or otherwise dealing with an offender the court---
        
    *   (a) must take into account the gravity of the offending in the particular case, including the degree of culpability of the offender; and
    
    *   (b) must take into account the seriousness of the type of offence in comparison with other types of offences, as indicated by the maximum penalties prescribed for the offences; and
    
    *   (c) must impose the maximum penalty prescribed for the offence if the offending is within the most serious of cases for which that penalty is prescribed, unless circumstances relating to the offender make that inappropriate; and
    
    *   (d) must impose a penalty near to the maximum prescribed for the offence if the offending is near to the most serious of cases for which that penalty is prescribed, unless circumstances relating to the offender make that inappropriate; and
    
    *   (e) must take into account the general desirability of consistency with appropriate sentencing levels and other means of dealing with offenders in respect of similar offenders committing similar offences in similar circumstances; and
    
    *   (f) must take into account any information provided to the court concerning the effect of the offending on the victim; and
    
    *   (g) must impose the least restrictive outcome that is appropriate in the circumstances, in accordance with the hierarchy of sentences and orders set out in [section 10A][18]; and
    
    *   (h) must take into account any particular circumstances of the offender that mean that a sentence or other means of dealing with the offender that would otherwise be appropriate would, in the particular instance, be disproportionately severe; and
    
    *   (i) must take into account the offender's personal, family, whanau, community, and cultural background in imposing a sentence or other means of dealing with the offender with a partly or wholly rehabilitative purpose; and
    
    *   (j) must take into account any outcomes of restorative justice processes that have occurred, or that the court is satisfied are likely to occur, in relation to the particular case (including, without limitation, anything referred to in [section 10][16]).
    
    Section 8(g): amended, on 1 October 2007, by [section 6(2)][447] of the Sentencing Amendment Act 2007 (2007 No 27).

        *   (i) the hostility is because of the common characteristic; and
        
        *   (ii) the offender believed that the victim has that characteristic:
        
        
    
    *   (ha) that the offence was committed as part of, or involves, a terrorist act (as defined in [section 5(1)][448] of the Terrorism Suppression Act 2002):
    
    *   (hb) the nature and extent of any connection between the offending and the offender's---
            
        *   (i) participation in an organised criminal group (within the meaning of [section 98A][449] of the Crimes Act 1961); or
        
        *   (ii) involvement in any other form of organised criminal association:
        
        
    
    *   (i) premeditation on the part of the offender and, if so, the level of premeditation involved:
    
    *   (j) the number, seriousness, date, relevance, and nature of any previous convictions of the offender and of any convictions for which the offender is being sentenced or otherwise dealt with at the same time:
    
    *   (k) any failure by the offender personally (or failure by the offender's lawyer arising out of the offender's instructions to, or failure or refusal to co-operate with, his or her lawyer) to comply with a procedural requirement that, in the court's opinion, has done either or both of the following:
            
        *   (i) caused a delay in the disposition of the proceedings:
        
        *   (ii) had an adverse effect on a victim or witness.

    *   (h) that the offender spent time on bail with an EM condition as defined in [section 3][450] of the Bail Act 2000\.
    
    (3) Despite subsection (2)(e), the court must not take into account by way of mitigation the fact that the offender was, at the time of committing the offence, affected by the voluntary consumption or use of alcohol or any drug or other substance (other than a drug or other substance used for bona fide medical purposes).
    
    (3A) In taking into account that the offender spent time on bail with an EM condition under subsection (2)(h), the court must consider---
        
    *   (a) the period of time that the offender spent on bail with an EM condition; and
    
    *   (b) the relative restrictiveness of the EM condition, particularly the frequency and duration of the offender's authorised absences from the electronic monitoring address; and
    
    *   (c) the offender's compliance with the bail conditions during the period of bail with an EM condition; and
    
    *   (d) any other relevant matter.

    *   (a) prevents the court from taking into account any other aggravating or mitigating factor that the court thinks fit; or
    
    *   (b) implies that a factor referred to in those subsections must be given greater weight than any other factor that the court might take into account.
    
    (4A) In subsection (1)(fb), _emergency health or fire services provider_ means a person who has a legal duty (under any enactment, employment contract, other binding agreement or arrangement, or other source) to, at the scene of an emergency, provide services that are either or both---
        
    *   (a) ambulance services, first aid, or medical or paramedical care:
    
    *   (b) services provided by or on behalf of a fire brigade (as defined in [section 2(1)][451] of the Fire Service Act 1975) to save life or property.
    
    (5) In this section, _procedural requirement_ means a requirement imposed by or under---

    *   (b) the court is satisfied that the application of any of the principles in [section 8][11] to the particular case make a fine inappropriate; or
    
    *   (c) any provision applicable to the particular offence in this or any other enactment provides a presumption in favour of imposing any other sentence or requires the court to impose any other sentence; or
    
    *   (d) the court is satisfied that a fine, on its own or in addition to a sentence of reparation, would otherwise be clearly inadequate in the circumstances.
    
    

##### 14 Reparation, fines, and financial capacity of offender
    
*   (1) Even if it would be appropriate in accordance with [section 13][24] to impose a fine, a court may nevertheless decide not to impose a fine if it is satisfied that the offender does not or will not have the means to pay it.
    
    (2) If a court considers that it would otherwise be appropriate to impose a sentence of reparation and a sentence of a fine, but it appears to the court that the offender has or will have the means to pay a fine or make reparation, but not both, the court must sentence the offender to make reparation.

##### 15 Community-based sentence

    *   (a) impose a sentence that would be permitted in combination with the first sentence under [section 19][33]; or

    (7) If the second sentence is a sentence of home detention or community detention and the court defers, under subsection (2)(b), the commencement of that sentence for more than 2 months, a probation officer must---
        
    *   (a) review the suitability of the home detention residence or curfew address; and
    
    *   (b) ensure every relevant occupant consents, in accordance with [section 26A(3)][45], to the offender resuming the sentence at the home detention residence or curfew address; and

    (3) A Registrar may apply in accordance with [section 72][141] for an order under subsection (1) on the ground that the Registrar reasonably believes that the sentence is unenforceable because the offender provided false or misleading information about the offender's financial position that the court relied on in imposing the sentence or because of any other reason.
    
    (4) The court may make an order under subsection (1) (whether on application or on its own initiative) only if---

    (5) If the court is considering a substitute sentence,---
        
    *   (a) the court must take the following matters into account:

        *   (ii) any other sentences or orders imposed on the offender for the offending for which the original reparation was imposed and the extent to which the reparation was taken into account in imposing those sentences or orders; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) if the offender provided false or misleading information about the offender's financial position, the court may take the following matters into account:
            
        *   (i) the extent to which the information was false or misleading:
        
        *   (ii) the offender's culpability in providing the information, including whether, in the court's opinion, the offender intended to mislead the court.
        
        
    
    (6) If the court cancels a sentence of reparation, the amount of reparation outstanding is deemed to be remitted from the date the order is made or any other date that the court may specify.

    (4) For the purpose of determining whether or not to excuse an offender under subsection (3), the probation officer may require that the offender obtain a certificate from a registered medical practitioner as to whether the offender is, will be, or was unfit to report on the day or during the period.
    
    (5) A certificate obtained in accordance with subsection (4) is not conclusive as to whether the offender is, will be, or was unfit to report.

### Subpart 3---Imprisonment

##### 81 Length of sentence of imprisonment
    
*   If under any enactment an offender is liable to imprisonment for life or for any specified term, the court may, in accordance with this Act, impose imprisonment for the maximum term provided for the particular offence or any lesser term, unless a minimum term of imprisonment is expressly provided for.
    
    Compare: 1985 No 120 [s 72][614]

##### 81B Procedure if offender convicted in District Court and court believes offender could be sentenced to life imprisonment
    
*   (1) This section applies if a person is convicted by a District Court of an offence with a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, and the court has reason to believe that a sentence of life imprisonment may be appropriate.
    
    (2) The court must transfer the offender to the High Court for sentence and make an entry in the permanent court record to the effect that the court has declined jurisdiction on the ground that it has reason to believe that the offender should be considered for a sentence of life imprisonment.
    
    Section 81B: inserted, on 1 July 2013, by [section 5][615] of the Sentencing Amendment Act (No 2) 2011 (2011 No 93).
    
    Section 81B(2): amended, on 1 July 2013, by [section 4][616] of the Sentencing Amendment Act 2013 (2013 No 32).

##### 82 Pre-sentence detention must not be taken into account in determining length of sentence
    
*   In determining the length of any sentence of imprisonment to be imposed, the court must not take into account any part of the period during which the offender was on pre-sentence detention as defined in [section 91][617] of the Parole Act 2002\.
    
    Compare: 1985 No 120 [s 81(2)][618]

##### 83 Cumulative and concurrent sentences of imprisonment
    
*   (1) A determinate sentence of imprisonment may be imposed cumulatively on any other determinate sentence of imprisonment that the court directs, whether then imposed or to which the offender is already subject, including any sentence in respect of which a direction of that kind is or has been given.
    
    (2) Despite subsection (1), a court may not impose a sentence of imprisonment cumulatively on another sentence of imprisonment if, at the time of sentencing, the offender is subject to a sentence of imprisonment but, having commenced serving the sentence, is no longer detained under it.
    
    (3) For the purposes of subsection (2), a person who is detained under an interim recall order under the [Parole Act 2002][619] is not detained under the sentence to which the interim recall order applies.
    
    (4) An indeterminate sentence of imprisonment must not be imposed cumulatively on any other sentence.
    
    (5) Any sentence of imprisonment may be imposed concurrently with any other sentence of imprisonment.
    
    (6) For the purpose of this section, a term of imprisonment imposed on an offender (whether by committal, sentence, or order) in respect of the non-payment of a sum of money, contempt of court, or disobedience of a court order is deemed to be a determinate sentence of imprisonment.
    
    Compare: 1985 No 120 [s 73][620]
    
    Section 83(2): replaced, on 7 July 2004, by [section 6][621] of the Sentencing Amendment Act 2004 (2004 No 68).

##### 84 Guidance on use of cumulative and concurrent sentences of imprisonment
    
*   (1) Cumulative sentences of imprisonment are generally appropriate if the offences for which an offender is being sentenced are different in kind, whether or not they are a connected series of offences.
    
    (2) Concurrent sentences of imprisonment are generally appropriate if the offences for which an offender is being sentenced are of a similar kind and are a connected series of offences.
    
    (3) In determining for the purpose of this section whether 2 or more offences committed by 1 offender are a connected series of offences, the court may consider---
        
    *   (a) the time at which they occurred; or
    
    *   (b) the overall nature of the offending; or
    
    *   (c) any other relationship between the offences that the court considers relevant.
    
    

##### 85 Court to consider totality of offending
    
*   (1) Subject to this section, if a court is considering imposing sentences of imprisonment for 2 or more offences, the individual sentences must reflect the seriousness of each offence.
    
    (2) If cumulative sentences of imprisonment are imposed, whether individually or in combination with concurrent sentences, they must not result in a total period of imprisonment wholly out of proportion to the gravity of the overall offending.
    
    (3) If, because of the need to ensure that the total term of cumulative sentences is not disproportionately long, the imposition of cumulative sentences would result in a series of short sentences that individually fail to reflect the seriousness of each offence, then longer concurrent sentences, or a combination of concurrent and cumulative sentences, must be preferred.
    
    (4) If only concurrent sentences are to be imposed,---
        
    *   (a) the most serious offence must, subject to any maximum penalty provided for that offence, receive the penalty that is appropriate for the totality of the offending; and
    
    *   (b) each of the lesser offences must receive the penalty appropriate to that offence.
    
    

#### Imposition of minimum period of imprisonment in relation to determinate sentence of imprisonment

##### 86 Imposition of minimum period of imprisonment in relation to determinate sentence of imprisonment
    
*   (1) If a court sentences an offender to a determinate sentence of imprisonment of more than 2 years for a particular offence, it may, at the same time as it sentences the offender, order that the offender serve a minimum period of imprisonment in relation to that particular sentence.
    
    (2) The court may impose a minimum period of imprisonment that is longer than the period otherwise applicable under [section 84(1)][622] of the Parole Act 2002 if it is satisfied that that period is insufficient for all or any of the following purposes:
        
    *   (a) holding the offender accountable for the harm done to the victim and the community by the offending:
    
    *   (b) denouncing the conduct in which the offender was involved:
    
    *   (c) deterring the offender or other persons from committing the same or a similar offence:
    
    *   (d) protecting the community from the offender.
    
    (3) \[Repealed\]
    
    (4) A minimum period of imprisonment imposed under this section must not exceed the lesser of---
        
    *   (a) two-thirds of the full term of the sentence; or
    
    *   (b) 10 years.
    
    (5) For the purposes of [Part 6][603] of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011, an order under this section is a sentence.

    (7) The court must give the offender a written notice that sets out the consequences if the offender is convicted of any serious violent offence committed after the warning given under subsection (1)(a).

    *   (a) a proceeding against a defendant charged with a stage-3 offence must be transferred to the High Court when the proceeding is adjourned for trial or trial callover under [section 57][654] of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011 or, as the case may be, in accordance with [section 36][655] of that Act, and the proceeding from that point, including the trial, must be in the High Court; and
    
    *   (b) no court other than the High Court, or the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court on an appeal, may sentence an offender for a stage-3 offence.
    
    (2) Despite any other enactment, if, on any occasion, an offender is convicted of 1 or more stage-3 offences other than murder, the High Court must sentence the offender to the maximum term of imprisonment prescribed for each offence.
    
    (3) When the court sentences the offender under subsection (2), the court must order that the offender serve the sentence without parole unless the court is satisfied that, given the circumstances of the offence and the offender, it would be manifestly unjust to make the order.
    
    (4) Despite subsection (3), if the court sentences the offender for manslaughter, the court must order that the offender serve a minimum period of imprisonment of not less than 20 years unless the court considers that, given the circumstances of the offence and the offender, a minimum period of that duration would be manifestly unjust, in which case the court must order that the offender serve a minimum period of imprisonment of not less than 10 years.
    
    (5) If the court does not make an order under subsection (3) or, where subsection (4) applies, does not order a minimum period of not less than 20 years under subsection (4), the court must give written reasons for not doing so.
    
    (6) If the court imposes a sentence under subsection (2), any other sentence of imprisonment imposed on the same occasion (whether for a stage-3 offence or for any other kind of offence) must be imposed concurrently.
    
    (7) Despite subsection (2), this section does not preclude the court from imposing, under [section 87][220], a sentence of preventive detention on the offender, and if the court imposes such a sentence on the offender,---

    *   (b) the minimum period of imprisonment that the court imposes on the offender under [section 89(1)][222] must not be less than the term of imprisonment that the court would have imposed under subsection (2), unless the court is satisfied that, given the circumstances of the offence and the offender, the imposition of that minimum period would be manifestly unjust.
    
    (8) If, in reliance on subsection (7)(b), the court imposes a minimum period of imprisonment that is less than the term of imprisonment that the court would have imposed under subsection (2), the court must give written reasons for doing so.

    *   (b) that murder is a stage-2 offence or a stage-3 offence.
    
    (2) If this section applies, the court must---
        
    *   (a) sentence the offender to imprisonment for life for that murder; and
    
    *   (b) order that the offender serve that sentence of imprisonment for life without parole unless the court is satisfied that, given the circumstances of the offence and the offender, it would be manifestly unjust to do so.
    
    (3) If the court does not make an order under subsection (2)(b), the court must give written reasons for not doing so.
    
    (4) If the court does not make an order under subsection (2)(b), the court must,---
        
    *   (a) if that murder is a stage-3 offence, impose a minimum period of imprisonment of not less than 20 years unless the court is satisfied that, given the circumstances of the offence and the offender, it would be manifestly unjust to do so; and
    
    *   (b) if that murder is a stage-2 offence, or if the court is satisfied that a minimum period of imprisonment of not less than 20 years under paragraph (a) would be manifestly unjust, order that the offender serve a minimum period of imprisonment in accordance with [section 103][244].
    
    (5) If, in the case of a stage-3 offence, the court imposes under subsection (4)(a) a minimum period of imprisonment of less than 20 years, the court must give written reasons for doing so.
    
    (6) If, in the case of a stage-2 offence, the court makes an order under subsection (4)(b) and the offender does not, at the time of sentencing, have a record of final warning, the court must---
        
    *   (a) warn the offender of the consequences if the offender is convicted of any serious violent offence committed after that warning; and
    
    *   (b) record that the offender has been warned in accordance with paragraph (a).
    
    (7) It is not necessary for a Judge to use a particular form of words in giving the warning.
    
    (8) On the entry of a record under subsection (6)(b), the offender has a record of final warning.
    
    (9) The court must give the offender a written notice that sets out the consequences if the offender is convicted of any serious violent offence committed after the warning given under subsection (6)(a).

##### 86F Continuing effect of warnings
    
*   (1) An offender continues to have a record of first warning or a record of final warning regardless of whether the offender has served or otherwise completed the sentence imposed on the offender for the offence (including, without limitation, any sentence imposed under [section 86D][213] or [86E][214]) to which the record relates.
    
    (2) However, an offender ceases to have a record of first warning or a record of final warning if, on an appeal, an appellate court---
        
    *   (a) quashes all the convictions to which the relevant record relates; and
    
    *   (b) does not replace 1 or more of those quashed convictions with a conviction for another serious violent offence.
    
    (3) If the appellate court quashes a conviction to which a record of first warning or a record of final warning relates, the appellate court must order that the record of the warning be cancelled in respect of that conviction.
