*   #### Preamble
    
    WHEREAS the Governor-General, purporting to act under the authority of section two of the Cemeteries Amendment Act 1912, did by Warrant under his hand dated the twenty-ninth day of October, nineteen hundred and twenty-three, and published in the _Gazette_ of the first day of November, nineteen hundred and twenty-three, declare certain lands in the City of Wellington described in the Schedule to the said Warrant to be a private burial-ground to be called and known by the name of ""The Private Burial-ground of the Right Honourable Richard John Seddon and of his Wife and Descendants"": And whereas doubts have arisen whether the authority conferred upon the Governor-General by the said section two of the Cemeteries Amendment Act 1912, to establish a private burial-ground can be exercised in respect of lands within the boundaries of a city: And whereas Louisa Jane Seddon, widow of the Right Honourable Richard John Seddon, in whom the fee-simple of the said lands was vested, as to part thereof by the [Reserves and other Lands Disposal and Public Bodies Empowering Act 1907][4], and as to other part thereof by the [Reserves and other Lands Disposal and Public Bodies Empowering Act 1910][5], has requested that the class of persons defined by the said Warrant who may now or hereafter be buried in the said private burial-ground should be further limited as hereinafter provided, and it is desirable that such further limitation should be defined:

BE IT THEREFORE ENACTED by the General Assembly of New Zealand in Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:---
