    *   (b) any amount so recovered may, after the deduction of the costs of collection, be paid to the other country without any further appropriation than this paragraph.
    
    (2) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), a certificate signed by an authorised officer of the competent institution of the other country that the debt is of a kind described in subparagraphs (i) to (iv) of [section 19B(1)(a)][44] is, in the absence of proof to the contrary, sufficient evidence of the existence of the debt.
    
    (3) Where an Order in Council is made under [section 19][42] in respect of an agreement which contains a provision of the kind referred to in [section 19A(2)(b)][43],---

    (4) Nothing in paragraph (c) or paragraph (d) of subsection (3) prevents the chief executive from taking adverse action against an individual if compliance with the requirements of subsection (3)(c) would prejudice any investigation into the commission of an offence or the possible commission of an offence.
    
    (4A) Subsection (4B) applies if---

    *   (a) specifying particulars of the discrepancy and of the action the chief executive proposes to take as a result of that discrepancy; and
    
    *   (b) specifying the unique identifiers assigned to that individual by the competent institutions of both countries; and

    *   (g) stating that the individual has 5 working days from the receipt of the notice to show cause why the chief executive should not take the action referred to in paragraph (a) or actions of the kinds referred to in paragraph (e).
    
    (4C) Despite subsections (3)(c) to (e) and (6), if subsection (4B) applies, after the expiration of the 5 working days referred to in subsection (4B)(g), the chief executive is not obliged to comply with subsection (3)(c) and (d) in respect of any information that is---
        
    *   (a) subsequently received from the other country under the provision; and
    
    *   (b) received for a purpose set out in subsection (4A)(c); and
    
    *   (c) matched against information held by the chief executive using the unique identifiers assigned to the individual concerned by the competent institutions of both countries.
    
    (5) Subsections (3) and (4) of [section 103][119] of the Privacy Act 1993 apply to any notice to be given to any individual under subsection (3)(c) or subsection (4B).
    
    (6) Where the chief executive fails to comply, in relation to any individual, with the provisions of subsection (3)(c), the failure is considered, for the purposes of [Part 8][120] of the Privacy Act 1993, to constitute a failure to comply with the provisions of [Part 10][121] of that Act.
    
    (7) In this section, expressions defined in [section 97][122] of the Privacy Act 1993 have the meanings so defined, with any necessary modifications.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Social Welfare (Transitional Provisions) Act 1990\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 20 September 2007 as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that have yet to come into force or that contain relevant transitional or savings provisions are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order.

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][141] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/legislation/reprints.shtml or Part 8 of the _Tables of Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations, and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][142] and [17E][143] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
