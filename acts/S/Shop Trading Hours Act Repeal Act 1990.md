## Schedule  
Protective provisions

[s 7][9]

*   1 No worker shall be required to work on a protected day or at night. No undue influence shall be applied to any worker in an attempt to induce that worker to agree to work on a protected day or at night. No action shall be taken to discriminate against or disadvantage any worker not wishing to work on a protected day or at night. This clause overrides clause 3\.

*   2 A worker who agrees to work on Sundays or at night shall give the employer at least 2 weeks notice of wanting to cease working on Sundays or at night. If a worker stops working on Sundays or at night, the employer does not have to offer the worker other working hours in substitution. This clause overrides clause 3\.

*   3 Workers shall continue to be employed on the basis of the conditions (in relation to working hours) that applied to them immediately before the commencement of this Act except where by mutual agreement between the employer and a worker the hours are altered.

*   4 Where an employer intends to open a shop on Sundays, at night, or on a protected day that is not a Sunday, the employer shall offer the work to protected workers who are suitably qualified and capable of carrying out the work before offering it to any other person.

*   5 Where no workers, or not enough workers, accept work on Sundays, at night, or on a protected day that is not a Sunday, the employer retains the right to recruit extra workers.

*   6 Where an employer decides to close a shop on a day that is not a protected day, or on part of such a day, the employer shall consult all workers affected, and the union, to minimise disruptions to work patterns.

*   7 The employer shall give all workers and the union at least 4 weeks written notice (including a description of the rights of workers under these provisions) of the employer's intention to employ workers on any protected day that is not a Sunday, or to begin or resume employing workers on Sundays or at night:
    
    provided that a shorter period of notice may be given by agreement with the union to meet the exigencies of a changed trading environment. The union shall not withhold its agreement unreasonably.

*   8 During the period referred to in clause 7, the employer shall give the union a reasonable opportunity to discuss with workers arrangements for work on Sundays or on any protected day that is not a Sunday or at night.

*   9 The employer shall consult with the union about alterations to patterns of working hours, or to job responsibilities, arising from a decision to open a shop on Sundays or at night.

*   10 The employer shall either provide or pay for transport between a worker's home and place of employment if the worker---
        
    *   (a) works during a protected day or at night; and
    
    *   (b) in order to do so, must leave home or work (as the case may be) when suitable public transport (by train, bus, ferry, boat, cable car, or a combination of 2 or more of those means of transport) is not available.
    
    

*   11 The employer shall ensure that the personal security of every worker who works alone at night is reasonably protected (for example by ensuring reasonable access to the presence and support of another worker or some other person).

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Shop Trading Hours Act Repeal Act 1990\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 11 April 2001, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][24] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][25] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][26] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][27] and [17E][28] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
