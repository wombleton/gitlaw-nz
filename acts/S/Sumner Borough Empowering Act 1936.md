    WHEREAS under section [thirty-four][9] of the [Reserves and other Lands Sale, Disposal, and Enabling and Public Bodies Empowering Act 1901][10], the Corporation of the Borough of Sumner (hereinafter referred to as the Corporation) is seised of an estate in fee-simple in all that parcel of land described in Schedule [1][7] hereto as a reserve for recreation purposes without power of sale or lease and subject to the condition that should the Lyttelton Harbour Board or any other Harbour Board at any time require the land for harbour or harbour-works purposes they shall have the right to enter upon, occupy, and use the same without having to pay compensation for so doing: And whereas the land will not be required by the Lyttelton Harbour Board or any other Harbour Board for harbour or harbour-works purposes: And whereas it is desirable to grant to the Sumner Borough Council (hereinafter referred to as the Council) power to lease the said land: And whereas all that parcel of land described in Schedule [2][8] hereto is vested in the Corporation and is part of an unformed street along the margin of the sea and is not required for use as a street: And whereas it is desirable to vest the said land described in Schedule [2][8] hereto in the Corporation as a reserve for recreation purposes without power of sale but with power to lease the said land:

BE IT THEREFORE ENACTED by the General Assembly of New Zealand in Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:---

*   The Governor-General may by Order in Council cancel the existing reservation over the land described in Schedule [1][7] hereto, and also cancel the hereinbefore recited condition in favour of the Lyttelton Harbour Board or any other Harbour Board, and declare the said land to be vested in the Corporation as a reserve for recreation purposes.

##### 3 Power to stop unformed street along seashore for recreation reserve
    
*   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Municipal Corporations Act 1933, the Council may, in the manner and upon the conditions set out in Schedule 5 to that Act, stop the portion of a street described in Schedule [2][8] hereto.
