    *   (d) the businesses of A and B have been so carried on that the separate business of each body corporate, or a substantial part of that business, is not readily identifiable; or
    
    *   (e) there is another body corporate to which A and B are both related.

    *   (f) A is a director of a body corporate and the body corporate has a relevant interest in the security; or
    
    *   (g) A is a member of a body corporate and the body corporate's constitution gives the member pre-emptive rights on the transfer of the security, if all members have preemptive rights on the same terms.

##### 42T When court may make pecuniary penalty orders and declarations of contravention
    
*   (1) If the FMA applies for a pecuniary penalty order against a person under this Act, the court---
        
    *   (a) must determine whether the person has contravened a civil remedy provision; and
    
    *   (b) must make a declaration of contravention (_see_ [sections 42U][317] and [42V][318]) if satisfied that the person has contravened a civil remedy provision; and
    
    *   (c) may order the person to pay a pecuniary penalty that the court considers appropriate to the Crown (_see_ [sections 42W to 42Y][319]) if satisfied that the person has contravened a civil remedy provision and that the contravention---
            
        *   (i) materially prejudices the interests of acquirers or disposers of the securities or relevant interests involved; or
        
        *   (ii) materially prejudices the public issuer or, if the public issuer is a body corporate, its members; or

    *   (b) a person avoids a loss if the person disposes of a security for more than its value.
    
    (2) In this case, the gain made or loss avoided is the difference between the consideration paid or received (as the case may be) and the value the security would have had at the time of the sale if, ---
        
    *   (a) in the case of a contravention of an insider conduct prohibition, the material information had been generally available to the market; or
    
    *   (b) in the case of a contravention of a market manipulation prohibition, the conduct, statement, or information had not been misleading, deceptive, or false.
    
    (3) In the case of a contravention of an unsolicited offer prohibition, subsection (2) does not apply.

*   This is a reprint of the Securities Markets Act 1988\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 October 2011, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][545] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][546] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][1] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][547] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][1] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][548] and [17E][549] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][1] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][1] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
