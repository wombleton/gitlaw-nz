    *   (a) [section 3][3]; and

    (4) In subsection (3), _reasonable use_, in relation to any land, includes the use or potential use of the land for any activity if the actual or potential effects of that activity in terms of [section 3][3] would not be significant.
    
    (5) If a person is entitled to claim compensation in respect of any matter or thing under this Act and also under any other enactment, that person is not entitled to receive---
        
    *   (a) compensation under this Act if compensation has been awarded under that other enactment; or

    (4) If notice has been given under subsection (1), no award of compensation under this Act is enforceable until after---
        
    *   (a) the expiration of 3 months from the giving of the notice; or
    
    *   (b) the time for objection or appeal has expired and all objections and appeals have been determined (in any case where the Authority has publicly notified a proposal to make a declaration excluding from protected land any part of the land in respect of which compensation has been awarded).
    
    

##### 23 Registration of compensation certificate
    
*   (1) If, under this Act or any other enactment, the Authority has entered into an agreement for the payment of compensation for damaging or detrimentally affecting any interest in land, or for the temporary occupation of any land, or for any condition or restriction to be applied in respect of the land, the Authority may lodge with the Registrar-General a certificate to that effect.

    (3) The amount to be paid at any time by a contributory local body in accordance with the apportionment is recoverable as a debt due to the Authority.
    
    (4) A contributory local body is not required, in any one year, to contribute to the expenditure of the Authority relating to the operation of this Act, a sum exceeding the amount of 1/4000 of a cent for every dollar of capital value of all rateable property within that part of its district specified in [Schedule 4][40].
    
    (5) Despite subsection (4), a contributory local body may be required to contribute to the expenditure of the Authority a sum exceeding the maximum amount due under subsection (4), if the contributory local body gives prior consent to the Authority in that year to the provision of a greater contribution.

##### 26 Estimates and reports

    *   (a) apply to the Environment Court for an enforcement order under [section 314][59] of the Resource Management Act 1991, as if the notice under subsection (1) were an abatement notice within the meaning of [section 322][60] of the Resource Management Act 1991; and

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Summit Road (Canterbury) Protection Act 2001\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 30 September 2008, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that have yet to come into force or that contain relevant transitional or savings provisions are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order.

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][68] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][69] and [17E][70] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
