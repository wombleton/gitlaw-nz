    And whereas the above-mentioned organizations were incorporated to perform in the Diocese of Christchurch in the Church of the Province of New Zealand, commonly called the Church of England, various types of social work as set out in their respective constitutions or rules:
    
    And whereas the Synod of the said Diocese in 1950 appointed a commission to inquire into the advisability of co-ordinating and extending the social work of the Diocese:
    
    And whereas the commission duly reported to the said Synod in 1951 and recommended, inter alia, that ""the amalgamation of all existing organizations doing social work into a new organization be the urgent objective of the Diocese"":
    
    And whereas the said Synod in 1951 approved the said recommendation and instructed the Standing Committee to submit to Parliament a private Bill to carry out the following:
        
    *   (a) the dissolution of not less than 2 of the following organizations---St. Saviour's Guild Society or Trust Board, St. Anne's Guild Society, and the Anglican Society of the Friends of the Aged Trust Board:
    
    *   (b) the establishment of a society to be known as the Anglican Society of Social Work or such other name as the Standing Committee should approve:
    
    *   (c) the transfer of all assets belonging to the organizations dissolved by the Bill to the society so to be established:
    
    And whereas the said Synod recommended the insertion in the Bill of certain provisions concerning trusts and the initial working of the Society established by the Bill, which recommendations are incorporated in this Act:
    
    And whereas the said Standing Committee has approved the name the Social Service Council of the Diocese of Christchurch:
    
    And whereas the said Synod resolved that no such Bill be submitted to Parliament until 2 or more of the above-mentioned organizations had given their unconditional assent to dissolution and the Standing Committee had approved the draft:
    
    And whereas all of the above-mentioned organizations have given their unconditional assent to dissolution by resolutions passed at meetings duly called in accordance with their respective constitutions or rules, and the Standing Committee has approved the draft of this Act.

For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][15] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][16] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][17] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][18] and [17E][19] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
