    *   (b) the perimeter of the area.
    
    (3) The area may be so described that it is divided into 2 or 3 sub-areas; and in that case,---
        
    *   (a) the perimeter of each sub-area must be separately described; and
    
    *   (b) the licensing authority or licensing committee concerned must designate one sub-area as the core area and one sub-area as the secondary area, and (if the area is divided into 3 sub-areas) must designate one sub-area as the overflow area.
    
    (4) The perimeter of the area or any sub-area may pass through the proposed locations (or, in the case of the renewal of a licence, any existing or proposed new locations) of any display units.
    
    (5) The authority or committee must describe an alcohol area within the premises only if, in its opinion,---
        
    *   (a) it is a single area; and

    *   (b) that---
            
        *   (i) is imposed on the renewal of an off-licence that is subject to a single-area condition; but

    (4) When stating a period under subsection (2), the licensing authority or licensing committee concerned may state any other conditions (being conditions the authority or committee thinks reasonable) to apply while the new single-area condition does not apply.
    
    (5) Until the new single-area condition applies, the other conditions take effect as conditions imposed under [section 117][136] or [132][154].
    
    (6) If the licensing authority or licensing committee concerned does not state a period under subsection (2) on renewing an off-licence subject to a new single-area condition, the new condition applies as soon as the renewal takes effect.
