##### 72 Application of this subpart
    
*   This subpart applies to the following New Zealand-based borrowers, other than new borrowers: 
        
    *   (a) borrowers who derive $1,500 or more of adjusted net income for a tax year and who have income from adjusted net income and salary or wages (if any) for that tax year of $1,500 or more above the annual repayment threshold:
    
    *   (b) borrowers to whom paragraph (a) does not apply in relation to a tax year and who---
            
        *   (i) have been required to pay interim payments for that tax year; or
        
        *   (ii) have been issued a default assessment for an end-of-year repayment obligation under [section 106][403] of the Tax Administration Act 1994 for that tax year.

##### 73 Meaning of adjusted net income
    
*   (1) In this Act, _adjusted net income_ means a borrower's income calculated in accordance with the formula---
    
    a = b − c
    
    where---
    
    **a**
    > 
    > is the borrower's adjusted net income
    
    **b**
    > 
    > is the borrower's annual gross income other than from salary or wages
    
    **c**
    > 
    > is the borrower's annual total deductions.
    
    (2) However, the income and deductions for any investment activity, or for any business, for a tax year are ignored when calculating a borrower's adjusted net income for that tax year if, treating the borrower as having only the income and deductions of that investment activity or of that business, the borrower would have a net loss for that year.
    
    (3) For the purposes of applying subsection (2), 2 or more business or investment activities may be treated as a single activity if the Commissioner considers that those business or investment activities are of a kind that are normally carried on in association with each other.
    
    (4) For the purposes of applying subsection (2), as modified by subsection (3), deductions that relate to an asset used in carrying on 2 or more business or investment activities must be appropriately apportioned between those activities on the basis of the use of that asset in those activities.
    
    (5) Subsections (2) to (4) do not apply to a borrower whose only income for the tax year is from pre-taxed income, or pre-taxed income and salary and wages.
    
    (6) In this section,---
    
    _business_ has the same meaning as in [section YA 1][318] of the Income Tax Act 2007
    
    _investment activity_ has the same meaning as in [section MB 3(5)][404] of the Income Tax Act 2007\.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 April 2013, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][707] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][708] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][709] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][710] and [17E][711] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
