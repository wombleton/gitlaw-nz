    (2) In order to co-ordinate as effectively as possible, and to render most useful the official statistics produced, and also to avoid unnecessary duplication of requests for information, all official statistics shall be subject to this Part, except where an exemption is specifically made by regulations made under this Act or by the Minister in writing.

##### 4 Classes of official statistics

##### 5 Necessity to inform Statistician of details of official statistics
    
*   (1) As soon as practicable after the commencement of this Act, the chief executive of each government department shall inform the Statistician of the official statistics for which that department is responsible. This information may, if the Statistician requires, include details of the concepts, classifications, and schedules used, the statistical methods and procedures employed, the resources employed, the means of publishing the official statistics and all other such matters as the Statistician may require so that he can exercise his duties under this Act; and thereafter an appropriate officer shall advise the Statistician of these matters when any new official statistics or substantial alteration to existing official statistics is being proposed in relation to his department, or when any document which is being used or proposed to be used as the source of official statistics is being amended or drafted.
    
    (2) The Statistician, after discussion with an appropriate officer of the government department concerned, may in any specific or general case, waive or relax, in whole or in part, the duty under subsection (1) in respect of that government department.
    
    (3) In the case of a disagreement between the parties in any discussion pursuant to subsection (2), the Minister shall decide the matter.
    
    Section 5(1): amended, on 1 July 2003, by [section 262][72] of the Local Government Act 2002 (2002 No 84).

##### 6 Minister to approve all statistical surveys

##### 8 Sampling
    
*   (1) Official statistics may be collected by means of the statistical procedure known as sampling, in place of a full enumeration, where the use of that method is considered appropriate.
    
    (2) The fact that, because of any sampling procedure, only a portion of a particular group of persons is required to fill in a schedule or to answer any inquiry shall not be a defence to the failure of any person to fill in that schedule or to answer that inquiry if so required by any Act.
