    (3) Before making such special order the Council shall cause a plan of the proposed drainage district to be deposited at the office of the Council and at the office of each Town Board (if any) within such proposed district.
    
    (4) Every such plan shall be open for inspection by the public without fee for at least one month before the passing of the resolution making the special order, and public notice of the time when and the place or places where such inspection can be made shall be given by the Council.
