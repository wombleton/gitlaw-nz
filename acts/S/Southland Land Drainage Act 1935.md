    (8) From the proceeds of any rate made under this section there may be deducted such sum as, in the opinion of the Council, is necessary to defray the cost of making and levying the rate and of the supervision and clerical work necessary in connection with the carrying out of the work, and the amount so deducted shall form part of the ordinary revenue of the county.

##### 14 Offences
    
*   Every person who at any time obstructs the Council or the Drainage Committee or any person appointed by either to carry out or do, or carrying out or doing, or about to carry out or do any work or thing authorised by or under this Act in the performance of anything that the Council or the Drainage Committee is empowered or required by this Act to do, is liable to a fine not exceeding 50 pounds.

##### 15 Parts of Land Drainage Act 1908 not to apply
    
*   [Part 4][23] of the Land Drainage Act 1908 shall not apply with respect to the Counties of Southland and Wallace.

    *   (b) in any case where the farm drain is situated between 2 adjoining farms, be payable in equal shares by the occupiers or (as aforesaid) the owners of the farms between which such farm drain runs, so that one-half of such cost and expenses shall as to each of such farms constitute a debt forthwith due and payable by the occupier, or if there is no occupier, then by the owner thereof, and be a charge on the land and may be recovered as rates which have been validly demanded are recoverable under the Rating Act 1925\.

*   For the purposes of any inspection, investigation, or inquiry directed by the Council in relation to any power conferred on the Council by this Act or the principal Act, and for the purpose of carrying out any work authorised by this Act or by the principal Act, the Council, or its surveyors, agents, officers, and workmen, may, upon giving the occupier or owner 24 hours' notice, enter upon any lands in the district and may do all things necessary or advisable in the opinion of the Council for the purpose of the exercise of such powers.

##### 7 Right to recover preliminary expenses where work not done
    
*   Expenses incurred by the Council under this Act or the principal Act in relation to any drain shall, notwithstanding that no work has been carried out on such drain by the Council, be recoverable by the Council as moneys are recoverable under subsection (3) of section 3 in the following cases, namely:
        
    *   (a) where in the case of any drain a written request has been received from the owner or occupier of any land for the exercise by the Council of any of its powers with respect to such drain, in which case such expenses shall constitute a debt forthwith due and payable to the Council by such owner or occupier and be recoverable as hereinbefore provided:
    
    *   (b) where such expenses have been incurred owing to the failure of any owner or occupier to cleanse or remove obstructions from a drain in accordance with any notice given under this Act or the principal Act, in which case such expenses shall constitute a debt forthwith due and payable to the Council by such owner or occupier and be recoverable as hereinbefore provided.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Southland Land Drainage Act 1935\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 26 October 1935 as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][24] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][25] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][26] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][27] and [17E][28] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
