    _homicide_ means the killing of a person or a child who has not become a person, by another person, intentionally or recklessly by any means that would be an offence under New Zealand law, whether done in New Zealand or elsewhere, but does not include---

    *   (d) an assisted suicide
    
    _killer_ means a person who kills a person or a child who has not become a person in any manner and in any circumstances that the person is guilty, either alone or with another person or persons, of the homicide of the person or child who has not become a person or would be so guilty if the killing had been done in New Zealand

    (2) This Act applies to interests in and claims against property resulting from the death of a victim after the commencement of this Act, but does not affect---

## Part 2  
Effect of homicide on rights of succession

#### Disentitlements of killers to property

##### 7 Disentitlement of killers under will or intestacy
    
*   (1) A killer is not entitled to any interest in property arising under a will of the killer's victim.
    
    (2) A killer is not entitled to any interest in property arising on the intestacy, or partial intestacy, of the killer's victim.
    
    (3) Subject to any express testamentary direction to the contrary, any interest in property that a killer is not entitled to under subsection (1) or subsection (2) is to pass or be distributed as if the killer had died before the killer's victim.
    
    (4) Subsections (1) and (3) are subject to [section 10(3) to (5)][13].

##### 8 Disentitlement of killer to victim's non-probate assets
    
*   (1) A killer is not entitled to any property interest in any non-probate assets of the killer's victim which, but for this subsection, would have passed to the killer on the death of the victim.
    
    (2) Any property interest that a killer is not entitled to under subsection (1) is to pass or be distributed as if the killer had died before the victim.
    
    (3) Despite subsection (2), property that is owned in joint tenancy by the victim, the victim's killer, and any other person (if any) devolves at the death of the victim as if the property were owned by each of them as tenants in common in equal shares.

##### 9 Disentitlement to apply under Family Protection Act 1955
    
*   A killer is not entitled to apply under the [Family Protection Act 1955][27] for provision out of the estate of the killer's victim.

##### 10 Restriction of killer's claims as to matrimonial property, testamentary promises, and restitution
    
*   (1) A killer who has a valid claim against the estate of a victim of the killer under the Matrimonial Property Act 1963 or the [Property (Relationships) Act 1976][28] or a valid claim for restitution for economic benefits conferred on the killer's victim is entitled in respect of that claim only to a benefit calculated in accordance with subsection (2).
    
    (2) The benefit referred to in subsection (1) must be calculated to ensure that---
        
    *   (a) the killer is not deprived of the benefit to which the killer is entitled for the services or other economic benefits he or she provided to the killer's victim; but
    
    *   (b) the killer's benefit is not made more certain or more valuable as a result of the death of the killer's victim.
    
    (3) A killer who is not entitled under [section 7][10] to any interest in property arising under a will of the killer's victim---
        
    *   (a) may make an application under the [Law Reform (Testamentary Promises) Act 1949][29] in respect of the victim's estate; and
    
    *   (b) must be treated for the purposes of that application as if the victim had failed to make testamentary provision for the killer.
    
    (4) A killer who has a valid claim against the estate of a victim of the killer under the [Law Reform (Testamentary Promises) Act 1949][29] is entitled in respect of that claim only to a benefit calculated in accordance with subsection (5).
    
    (5) The benefit referred to in subsection (4) must be calculated to ensure that the killer's benefit is no more certain or more valuable than the killer would have been entitled to if the victim of the killer had continued to live for the period reasonably expected before the victim was killed.

##### 11 Disentitlement of killer to enhanced benefits generally
    
*   (1) This section applies only in respect of property of a victim that is not---
        
    *   (a) within the victim's estate; or
    
    *   (b) a non-probate asset of the victim.
    
    (2) A killer whose interest in or claim against property to which this section applies is affected by the death of the killer's victim is not entitled to any more certain or more valuable interest in the property as a result of the death of the victim than the killer would otherwise have been entitled to.
    
    (3) Without limiting subsection (2), a killer is not entitled to benefit in respect of any property to which this section applies as a result of the death of the killer's victim if---
        
    *   (a) the killing prevented the birth of the victim; or
    
    *   (b) the killing altered the order in which it could reasonably have been expected that the killer and the victim would have died; or
    
    *   (c) the killing prevented the victim from reaching any particular age or satisfying any other condition; or
    
    *   (d) the killing reduced or closed the membership of a class of beneficiaries that included the victim; or
    
    *   (e) the killing shortened the period during which the victim could reasonably have been expected to possess an interest in property in which the killer has an interest in remainder.
    
    

##### 12 Applications by victim's estate under section 88(2) of Property (Relationships) Act 1976
    
*   When applying [section 88(2)][30] of the Property (Relationships) Act 1976, the court must treat the refusal of leave under that provision as causing a serious injustice if the refusal of leave would allow the killer to retain a more certain or more valuable interest in the property.

##### 13 Caveat against dealing with land
    
*   (1) If an interested person claims that an owner of an undivided estate or interest in land as a joint tenant with a victim is the killer of that victim, the interested person may lodge a caveat in accordance with [section 137][31] of the Land Transfer Act 1952 in respect of that estate or interest.
    
    (2) For as long as a caveat under this section remains in force, the Registrar-General of Land must not register a transmission on survivorship to the alleged killer, or the alleged killer and any other joint tenant, of any estate or interest affected by the caveat.
    
    (3) The provisions of the [Land Transfer Act 1952][32], other than [section 141(1)][33], apply to a caveat lodged under this section.
    
    (4) [Section 141(2) and (3)][33] of the Land Transfer Act 1952 apply, with any necessary modifications, in respect of a caveat lodged under this section.

##### 14 Evidential effect of conviction in New Zealand
    
*   (1) The conviction in New Zealand of a person for the homicide of another person or a child that has not become a person is conclusive evidence for the purposes of this Act that the person is guilty of that homicide, unless that conviction has been quashed.
    
    (2) A certificate issued under [section 146A][34] of the Sentencing Act 2002 is conclusive evidence that a person convicted of an offence of unlawfully killing another person or a child that has not become a person is for the purposes of this Act guilty of the homicide of that other person or child that has not become a person.
    
    (3) Subsection (2) is subject to subsection (1).

##### 15 Evidential effect of acquittal in New Zealand
    
*   The acquittal in New Zealand of a person on the grounds of that person's insanity in respect of the homicide of another person or a child that has not become a person is conclusive evidence for the purposes of this Act that the person is not guilty of that homicide.

##### 16 Evidence if no criminal prosecution or unsuccessful prosecution in New Zealand
    
*   (1) This section applies if,---
        
    *   (a) in any proceedings in which the application of this Act is in issue, any party alleges that another person is guilty of the homicide of a person or a child that has not become a person; and
    
    *   (b) the person who is alleged to be guilty of the homicide of another person or child that has not become a person has---
            
        *   (i) not been prosecuted in New Zealand in respect of that homicide, whether or not the person has been prosecuted, convicted, or acquitted elsewhere; or
        
        *   (ii) been prosecuted in New Zealand in respect of that homicide but has been acquitted other than on the grounds of insanity or the prosecution has been stayed or withdrawn, whether or not the person has been prosecuted, convicted, or acquitted elsewhere.
        
        
    
    (2) If this section applies,---
        
    *   (a) the court hearing the proceedings may decide for the purposes of this Act whether the killing of a person or a child that has not become a person has taken place and, if so, whether, if the alleged killer had been prosecuted in New Zealand, he or she---
            
        *   (i) would be guilty of the homicide of that person or child that has not become a person; or
        
        *   (ii) would by reason of insanity not be guilty of the homicide of that person or child that has not become a person:
        
        
    
    *   (b) a person who alleges that another person is guilty of homicide for the purposes of this Act must satisfy the court of that fact on the balance of probabilities:
    
    *   (c) a person who alleges that he or she is not guilty of the homicide for the purposes of this Act by reason of insanity must satisfy the court of that fact on the balance of probabilities:
    
    *   (d) the conviction elsewhere than in New Zealand of a person in respect of homicide is, for the purposes of this Act, admissible evidence as to whether the person is guilty or not guilty of the homicide and is to be given any weight that the court determines.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Succession (Homicide) Act 2007\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Succession (Homicide) Act 2007 as at 18 October 2007, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that have yet to come into force or that contain relevant transitional or savings provisions are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order.

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][40] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/legislation/reprints.shtml or Part 8 of the _Tables of Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations, and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][41] and [17E][42] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
