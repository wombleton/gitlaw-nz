An Act to reconstitute the trusts upon which the assets of the St Peter's School Trust Board Incorporated are to be held, to redefine the powers of the board, and to prescribe the board's constitution
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    Whereas on 7 March 1935 a private company, St Peter's Limited, was incorporated under the Companies Act 1933, the original shareholders being Arthur Francis Brooks Broadhurst and James Morris Beaufort who, by the articles of association, were appointed the governing directors of the company for their respective lives or until retirement: 
    
    And whereas the principal object of the company was to establish, maintain, and carry on at Cambridge in the Provincial District of Auckland in the Dominion of New Zealand or at such other place or places within the Dominion of New Zealand as may be selected a school or schools where scholars may obtain a sound intellectual, classical, mathematical, technical, manual, physical, and general education in the junior or senior departments of education, and also where provision shall be made for non-sectarian religious instruction for all scholars and special provision for religious instruction in a form in accordance with the teaching of the Church of England for all Church of England scholars and for others with their parents' consent, and where full facilities shall be granted for the scholars of other denominations to attend their respective places of worship: 
    
    And whereas the company established, acquired and carried on a school, known as St Peter's School, on land owned by the company: 
    
    And whereas the said 2 shareholders were joint headmasters of St Peter's School: 
    
    And whereas the said James Morris Beaufort retired and transferred his shares in the company to the said Arthur Francis Brooks Broadhurst:
    
    And whereas by a deed dated 1 February 1939 made between the said Arthur Francis Brooks Broadhurst (therein called the **donor**) of the one part and the donor himself and 3 other persons (therein called the **trustees**) of the other part the donor transferred all except 4 of the shares to the trustees jointly and retained 1 share himself and transferred 1 share to each of the other 3 trustees, and also transferred to the trustees jointly a debenture securing a loan from the donor to the company and a further unsecured loan from the donor to the company:
    
    And whereas the land upon which the school buildings and the playing fields are situated is still owned by the company: 
    
    And whereas the trustees were incorporated as a trust board under the provisions of the Religious, Charitable, and Educational Trusts Act 1908:
    
    And whereas the said trust board has acquired farm lands and carries on the business of farming for the benefit of the school: 
    
    And whereas it is intended to wind up voluntarily the company and transfer its assets in specie to the trust board: 
    
    And whereas the number of members of the trust was limited to 4 and by virtue of new articles of association of the company passed in 1962 the number of directors that had previously been so limited thereinafter was changed to such number as from time to time the company in general meeting should determine: 
    
    And whereas it was recently discovered that by reason of the increase in the number of directors of the company the number of trustees had been inadvertently increased above the limited number, all except 1 of whom had been invalidly appointed:
    
    And whereas by an order of the High Court of New Zealand at Hamilton made on 24 June 1983 3 persons were validly appointed as members of the trust board in addition to the previously validly appointed person: 
    
    And whereas because the trust board and the 4 members thereof are all the shareholders in the company they can lawfully carry out any of the objects contained in its memorandum of association, which objects are wider than the trusts conferred upon them by the said deed dated 1 February 1939: 
    
    And whereas it is expedient that the trust board should be empowered to carry out any of the objects that could lawfully be carried out by the company after it has been wound up:
    
    And whereas to comply with modern needs it is expedient to increase the range of subjects that may be taught at the school:
    
    And whereas it is necessary to enlarge the number of persons who may be members of the trust board:
    
    And whereas it is in the best interest of the pupils of the school that the reconstructed trusts should be made lawful as soon as possible:
    
    And whereas legislation is the only means whereby this can be effected efficiently and economically and without interference with the continued running of the school for the beneficial education of the pupils.

Except as otherwise provided in this constitution not less than one-half of the duly appointed trustees personally present shall constitute a quorum.
    
    (7) If within half an hour from the time appointed for a meeting a quorum is not present, a special meeting convened upon the requisition of 3 trustees pursuant to subclause (2) shall be dissolved.

    (8) Subject to [clause 18][16] of this constitution, a meeting of the board at which a quorum is present shall be competent to exercise all or any of the authorities, powers, and discretions by or under this constitution for the time being vested in or exercisable by the board or the trustees generally.

    (11) The chairman may, with the consent of any meeting at which a quorum is present (and shall if so directed by the meeting), adjourn the meeting from time to time and from place to place, but no business shall be transacted at any adjourned meeting other than business on the agenda of the meeting at which the adjournment took place. When the meeting is adjourned for 10 days or more, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given as in the case of an original meeting.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the St Peter's School Trust Board Act 1985\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 22 May 1997, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][30] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][31] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][32] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][33] and [17E][34] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
