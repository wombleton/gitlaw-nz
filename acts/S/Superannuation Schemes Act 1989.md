##### 9BAA When FMA may approve transfers without consent of members and beneficiaries
    
*   (1) The requirement in [section 9B][15] to obtain the written consent of all or any of the members and beneficiaries of a scheme does not apply if the FMA approves the transfer under this section.
    
    (1B) This section applies despite anything to the contrary in a scheme's trust deed.
    
    (2) The FMA may approve the transfer if, and only if, the FMA is satisfied that---
        
    *   (a) the terms and conditions of the scheme to which the members or beneficiaries are to be transferred (_new scheme_) are no less favourable to members or beneficiaries than the terms and conditions of the scheme from which they are being transferred (_old scheme_); and
    
    *   (b) the transfer is otherwise reasonable in all the circumstances (including having regard to the value of the assets transferred from the old scheme to the new scheme); and
    
    *   (c) the procedure in [section 9BAB][17] has been followed.
    
    (3) The FMA may decline to approve a transfer if the FMA considers that the transfer would adversely affect the interests of all or any of the members and beneficiaries of the old scheme in any material way.
    
    (4) In determining whether subsection (2) or (3) applies, the FMA may---
        
    *   (a) have regard to the likely effect of the new scheme on benefits to members and beneficiaries as a whole; and
    
    *   (b) have regard to any other matter that the FMA considers relevant.
    
    (4B) For a transfer that the FMA has approved,---
        
    *   (a) each relevant member of the old scheme is treated as offering to be a member of the new scheme on the terms and conditions for that new scheme; and
    
    *   (b) the trustee of the new scheme is treated as accepting the member's offer.
    
    (5) The FMA may publish, in any form that the FMA considers fit, guidance as to matters that the FMA considers relevant under this section (including principles that the FMA may use to decide whether to approve the transfer).

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 July 2012, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][182] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][183] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][184] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][185] and [17E][186] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
