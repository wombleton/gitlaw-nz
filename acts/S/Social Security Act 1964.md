    *   (b) are or have been issued with entitlement cards pursuant to regulations in force under this Act; or

    (4) Where the chief executive obtains information pursuant to a notice issued under subsection (1), and that information, when used in an information-matching programme, produces a discrepancy, the chief executive shall not take adverse action against any individual in relation to that discrepancy---
        
    *   (a) unless the chief executive has given that individual written notice---
            
        *   (i) specifying particulars of the discrepancy and of the adverse action the chief executive proposes to take; and
        
        *   (ii) stating that the individual has 5 working days from the receipt of the notice in which to show cause why the action should not be taken; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) until the expiration of those 5 working days.
    
    (5) Nothing in subsection (4) prevents the chief executive from taking adverse action against an individual if compliance with the requirements of that subsection would prejudice any investigation into the commission of an offence or the possible commission of an offence.

    *   (a) the chief executive shall not be required to prepare more than 1 technical standards report in respect of information received from any employer or employers pursuant to subsection (1) where the standards in that report are to apply to information so obtained from any employers generally; and
    
    *   (b) the chief executive shall not be required to make that report available to any employer given notice pursuant to subsection (1), and nor shall any such employer be required to hold a copy of that report.
    
    (7) Where the chief executive fails to comply, in relation to any individual, with subsection (4) or with any of the provisions of the sections or rules applied by subsection (6), the failure shall, for the purposes of [Part 8][671] of the Privacy Act 1993, be deemed to constitute a failure to comply with the provisions of [Part 10][672] of that Act.
    
    (8) In this section, _information matching programme_ means the comparison of information obtained pursuant to subsection (1) with other personal information held by the department for the purpose of producing or verifying information about an identifiable individual; and expressions otherwise defined in [section 97][673] of the Privacy Act 1993 shall have the meanings so defined, with any necessary modifications.
    
    (9) Nothing in this section shall limit or affect the provisions of [section 103(1A)][674] of the Privacy Act 1993\.

##### 11B Code of conduct applying to obtaining information under section 11
    
*   (1) The chief executive, in consultation with the Privacy Commissioner appointed under the [Privacy Act 1993][675], must, within 3 months after the commencement of this section, issue a code of conduct that applies in respect of requirements to supply information or documents under [section 11(1)][18], and the chief executive, and every officer of the department acting under the delegation of the chief executive must comply with that code of conduct in relation to making any such requirement.
    
    (2) The code of conduct---
        
    *   (a) must include the matters specified in [section 11C][21]; and
    
    *   (b) may include restrictions on obtaining---
            
        *   (i) specified classes of information or documents; and
        
        *   (ii) information or documents from specified classes of persons or from persons in specified relationships---
        
        pursuant to a requirement under [section 11(1)][18]; and
    
    *   (c) must specify procedures applying to the obtaining of information or documents under [section 11][18].
    
    (3) The chief executive may from time to time, in consultation with the Privacy Commissioner, amend the code of conduct, or revoke the code of conduct and issue a new code of conduct.
    
    (4) Nothing in the code of conduct may derogate from any code of practice issued by the Privacy Commissioner under [Part 6][676] of the Privacy Act 1993 that applies to the information required under [section 11][18], and the chief executive, in consultation with the Privacy Commissioner, must amend the code of conduct to conform with any such code of practice. This subsection is affected by subsection (5).
    
    (5) Without limiting the general power to make regulations conferred by [section 132][437], the Governor-General may, on the advice of the Minister given after consultation with the Privacy Commissioner, by Order in Council, make regulations under that section authorising the chief executive to obtain---
        
    *   (a) any specified class of information or document; or
    
    *   (b) information or documents from any specified class of persons; or
    
    *   (c) information or documents in any specified manner---
    
    pursuant to a requirement under [section 11(1)][18], despite the fact that the making of that requirement would otherwise be in breach of any code of practice issued by the Privacy Commissioner under [Part 6][676] of the Privacy Act 1993\.
    
    (6) Any person who is---

    *   (a) provisions---
            
        *   (i) requiring any information or document to be first sought from a beneficiary; and

    *   (b) a provision prohibiting a requirement under [section 11(1)][18] being made in respect of a beneficiary to any person (not being the beneficiary, an employer or former employer of the beneficiary, a financial institution, or a law practitioner) unless there is reasonable cause to make a requirement under that section:

##### 11D Application process for benefits
    
*   (1) A benefit must not be granted to an applicant unless the requirement stated in subsection (2) has been complied with.
    
    (2) The requirement referred to in subsection (1) is that the department has received---
        
    *   (a) an application form (provided by the chief executive for the purpose) completed by or on behalf of the applicant and his or her spouse or partner (if any) to the chief executive's satisfaction; and
    
    *   (b) any supporting evidence (for example, a medical certificate) reasonably required by the chief executive.
    
    (3) The form referred to in subsection (2)(a) does not have to refer to a benefit of any particular kind.
    
    (3A) If the chief executive considers that the appropriate benefit for an applicant is a youth support payment, he or she may require as supporting evidence under subsection (2)(b) evidence of the applicant's accommodation costs and service costs (within the meaning of [section 157][486]), debts, and other liabilities.
    
    (3B) Subsection (3A) does not limit the generality of subsection (2)(b).
    
    (4) The receipt by the department of a completed application form relating to a benefit of one kind is sufficient compliance with subsection (2)(a) to enable the granting of a benefit of another kind.
    
    (5) The chief executive---
        
    *   (a) may waive all or part of a requirement to provide information under this section if satisfied that the department---
            
        *   (i) already holds the information concerned; or
        
        *   (ii) already holds enough other information to determine the matter for which the information concerned is needed; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) may waive the requirement to complete an application form if satisfied that the department already holds a form relating to an application that has lapsed under subsection (8).
    
    (6) Subsection (1) is subject to subsection (5) and to [section 81(3)][307].
    
    (7) If the requirement stated in subsection (2) has been complied with, an application for a benefit must for the purposes of [sections 80][297] and [80BA][301] be treated as having been received on the date of first contact.
    
    (8) An application for a benefit lapses at the close of the period of 20 working days after the date of first contact (as from time to time extended under subsection (10)) unless, within the period, the requirement stated in subsection (2) has been complied with.
    
    (9) Subsection (8) does not apply to an application for a benefit made by a person resident in an overseas country to the competent authority of that country pursuant to an agreement or convention given effect in relation to New Zealand by an Order in Council made pursuant to [section 19][678] of the Social Welfare (Transitional Provisions) Act 1990\.
    
    (10) Before or after the expiration of the period referred to in subsection (8), the chief executive may extend that period, if in any particular case he or she thinks that there is a good and sufficient reason for non-compliance with the requirement stated in subsection (2) within that period.
    
    (11) The combined effect of subsections (1) and (8) is that an applicant whose application for a benefit has lapsed cannot become entitled to the benefit without applying for it again and establishing his or her eligibility to receive it.
    
    (12) This section is subject to [section 96A][349].

##### 12 Investigation of claims and grant of benefits
    
*   (1) Every claim for a benefit shall be investigated by the chief executive or by an officer of the department acting with the authority of the chief executive, and all benefits shall (subject to any delegation of the chief executive's powers under this Act) be granted by the chief executive.
    
    (1AA) If he or she thinks an investigation into an application for a benefit of kind A is unlikely to be completed quickly (for example, because of the need to obtain further medical evidence), the chief executive may grant the applicant a benefit of kind B to which the applicant is entitled, on the basis that a benefit of kind A will be granted retroactively if it becomes apparent that the applicant is entitled to a benefit of kind A; and in that case, if (when the investigation has been completed) it becomes apparent that the applicant is in fact entitled to a benefit of kind A, the chief executive may---
        
    *   (a) grant the applicant a benefit of kind A commencing on the date on which it would have commenced if the investigation had been completed before the benefit of kind B was granted; and
    
    *   (b) terminate the benefit of kind B on that date.
    
    (1A) The chief executive or any officer of the department acting with the authority of the chief executive may investigate the circumstances of any person who has been in receipt of a benefit as those circumstances existed immediately before the benefit was granted or during the period that the benefit was paid.
    
    (2) It shall be the duty of every person (including the applicant) to answer all questions put to him by the chief executive or by any officer of the department concerning any applicant for a benefit or any person who is or has been in receipt of a benefit or concerning any statements contained in any application for a benefit, or concerning the means, earning capacity, and economic circumstances of any person, for the purposes of [section 46][681] or [section 91][682] of the Family Proceedings Act 1980, or of any person who is or may be liable to maintain any applicant for a benefit or any beneficiary, or any dependant of such an applicant or of a beneficiary.
    
    (3) Every person commits an offence who demands or accepts from any applicant or from any other person any fee or other consideration for procuring or endeavouring to procure the grant of a benefit.

    provided also that, where the chief executive is of the opinion that a person applying for or in receipt of an invalid's benefit, a domestic purposes benefit, a widow's benefit, or an unemployment benefit or a sickness benefit should undergo a course of training in any occupation, or should submit himself for examination at any medical or psychological clinic, or should receive any medical or other treatment, or should undergo any course of training for the improvement of his physical or mental capacities, or should do any work required of him, or should take more adequate steps to secure suitable employment, the chief executive may, in the chief executive's discretion, grant an emergency benefit instead of or in substitution for an invalid's benefit, a domestic purposes benefit, a widow's benefit, an independent youth benefit, or an unemployment benefit or a sickness benefit; and in any such case the grant or continuance of the emergency benefit may be made subject to the condition that he shall comply with the requirements of the chief executive in respect of any such matters.
    
    (1A) Where the chief executive is considering granting an emergency benefit on the grounds of hardship under subsection (1), the chief executive must first consider whether to grant a sickness benefit under [section 54A][146] or an unemployment benefit under [section 90][340] or a youth payment under [section 161][491] or a young parent payment under [section 167][498].

    *   (c) an invalid's benefit; or
    
    *   (d) temporary additional support.
    
    (1C) The chief executive may cancel the benefit being received by a person to whom subsection (1B) applies and grant the person instead an emergency benefit payable at the same rate of benefit as the benefit the person was receiving.
    
    (1D) In exercising the power given by subsection (1C), the chief executive is not required to---
        
    *   (a) exercise discretion; or
    
    *   (b) determine whether the person would meet the requirements in subsection (1) for an emergency benefit.
    
    (2) The rate of the emergency benefit shall, in each case, be in the discretion of the chief executive, but, except in any case where the beneficiary is receiving medical or other treatment, shall not exceed the rate to which the beneficiary would be entitled if he were qualified to receive such other benefit as in the opinion of the chief executive is analogous to the emergency benefit.
    
    (3) Every emergency benefit shall commence on such date and shall be continued for such period and subject to such conditions as the chief executive in each case determines.

    (5) Notwithstanding anything in this section but subject to [section 68A][268], if---
        
    *   (a) a person who is married or in a civil union or in a de facto relationship (the _recipient_) is in receipt of New Zealand superannuation or a veteran's pension, or of an invalid's benefit, or an unemployment benefit or a sickness benefit, or a related emergency benefit; and
    
    *   (b) the recipient's spouse or partner is either---
            
        *   (i) a patient in a hospital (as defined in [section 75(1)][291]) who is in receipt of a reduced benefit under section 75(3) or (4); or
        
        *   (ii) a resident assessed as requiring care (as defined in [section 136][459]), and in respect of whom a funder (as defined in that section) is paying some or all of the cost of contracted care services (as defined in that section) under [section 141][466] or [142][467],---
        
        
    
    *   (c) \[Repealed\]
    
    the chief executive shall grant a special disability allowance at the rate specified in [Schedule 19][534] to the recipient for the purpose of defraying expenses arising from the hospitalisation of the spouse or partner.
    
    (6) Despite subsection (2)(a), the chief executive may grant a disability allowance under this section to any person who would otherwise qualify for it and---
        
    *   (a) whose life expectancy is less than 6 months; or
    
    *   (b) it is not possible to determine whether the disability is likely to continue for not less than 6 months but that is a reasonably possible prognosis.
    
    (7) Where any person, whose application for a disability allowance has been declined only on the grounds that the disability is likely to last less than 6 months, subsequently shows to the satisfaction of the chief executive that the disability in respect of which that application was made---
        
    *   (a) is likely to last for 6 months or more; or
    
    *   (b) has continued for 6 months or more,---
    
    and that the person would otherwise have been entitled to receive a disability allowance since the date of the original application, the chief executive must grant a disability allowance to that person commencing on the date of the original application.
    
    (7A) This subsection applies to a person if---
        
    *   (a) any additional expenses arising from a disability relate to the supply of any goods or services to the person or a member of the person's family; and
    
    *   (b) all or a specified part of a disability allowance is granted in respect of the supply of the goods or services; and
    
    *   (c) those goods or services are of a class, description, or kind supplied by a preferred supplier (being a preferred supplier to, or in respect of, the area in which the person resides) under a contract entered into with the chief executive under [section 125AA][410].
    
    (7B) If subsection (7A) applies to a person,---
        
    *   (a) the person must, for every supply of the goods or services after a nomination given to the person by the chief executive has come into force and while it remains in force, purchase the goods or services from a preferred supplier specified in that nomination and at the price determined by the contract under [section 125AA][410] with that supplier; and
    
    *   (b) the chief executive must, despite subsections (1) to (7), pay all, or the specified part, of the disability allowance that is granted in respect of the supply of the goods or services to that supplier in consideration of the supply of the goods or services to the person or the person's family member.
    
    (7BA) A nomination under subsection (7B)(a)---
        
    *   (a) may be given orally or in writing (but, if given orally, must as soon as practicable be confirmed in writing); and
    
    *   (b) may from time to time be amended, revoked, or revoked and replaced by the chief executive, to recognise changes in preferred suppliers or preferred supply contracts ending without also being replaced.
    
    (7BB) However, if the person's net total benefit payments due to be paid on a pay day (after deducting any redirection under [section 82(3)][308] or reduction or deduction required to be made from the person's benefit payments for another purpose (for example, under an attachment order or a deduction notice)) are less than the amount required to pay the preferred supplier on that pay day, the chief executive---
        
    *   (a) is not required by subsection (7B)(b) to pay to the preferred supplier on that pay day all, or the specified part, of the person's disability allowance due on that pay day; but
    
    *   (b) may pay the amount due to the preferred supplier on 1 or more later pay days from amounts of disability allowance or other benefit payments due to the person on those 1 or more later pay days.
    
    (7BC) Non-payment, or deferred payment, under subsection (7BB) does not reduce any amounts due to the preferred supplier from the person under, or make the chief executive or the Crown liable for breaching, the person's contract of purchase.
    
    (7C) However, if the disability allowance granted to the person to whom subsection (7A) applies is granted at the maximum appropriate rate specified in [Schedule 19][534], the chief executive may, in the chief executive's discretion, determine in writing that, despite subsection (7B),---
        
    *   (a) all, or the specified part, of the disability allowance that is granted in respect of the supply of the goods or services must be paid to the person for use only to purchase any 1 or more of the goods or services that the person chooses and that are goods or services in respect of the supply of which the disability allowance is granted; and
    
    *   (b) if the goods or services that the person chooses and purchases under paragraph (a) are goods or services supplied by the nominated preferred supplier under the contract entered into with the chief executive under [section 125AA][410], then the person must purchase them from that supplier at the price determined by that contract.
    
    (7D) No appeal under this Act lies against any chief executive's decision under subsections (7B) to (7C).
    
    (7E) Subsections (7A) to (7D) are subject to (preferred supplier transitional provisions) directions under [section 125AA(5)][410].
    
    (8) In this section,---
    
    _disability_ has the meaning ascribed to it by [section 21(1)(h)][883] of the Human Rights Act 1993
    
    _health practitioner_---
        
    *   (a) has the same meaning as in [section 5(1)][884] of the Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003; and
    
    *   (b) includes---
            
        *   (i) a former health practitioner within the meaning of that section; and
        
        *   (ii) a person who is receiving training or gaining experience under the supervision of a health practitioner.

    *   (a) is not a child; and
    
    *   (b) is not entitled to be the holder of a community services card issued pursuant to the [Health Entitlement Cards Regulations 1993][896] (SR 1993/169).
    
    (3) The chief executive may, from time to time, on application by or on behalf of any person to whom this section applies, assess in accordance with [Schedule 30][545] the weekly amount that person is required to pay toward the cost of the home-based disability support services supplied to that person, and that person is required to pay the amount so assessed in accordance with the assessment.
    
    (4) For the purposes of [Schedule 30][545],---
        
    *   (a) the following is to be treated as $1 per week of income:
            
        *   (i) every $100 of cash assets over $5,400 held by a person who is married or in a civil union or in a de facto relationship:
        
        *   (ii) every $100 of cash assets over $5,400 held by a single person who has a dependent child or children:

    *   (b) the income of a person who is married or in a civil union or in a de facto relationship includes the income of his or her spouse or partner.
    
    (5) In any case where the chief executive is satisfied that a person to whom this section applies, or that person's spouse or partner, has not realised any assets available for that person's personal use, the chief executive may treat any such assets as being cash assets for the purposes of subsection (4).
    
    (6) Every assessment made by the chief executive under subsection (3) must state---
        
    *   (a) the date of the assessment; and
    
    *   (b) the amount that the person has been assessed as being required to pay toward the cost of the home-based disability support services supplied to that person---
    
    and the chief executive must supply a copy of that assessment to that person, and may supply the details specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) to the applicable district health board.
    
    (7) The chief executive must from time to time review any assessment under this section, and may revise that assessment if---
        
    *   (a) the chief executive is satisfied the assessment is in error; or
    
    *   (b) the person to whom the assessment relates or his or her spouse or partner fails to provide any relevant information requested or to answer any relevant question; or
    
    *   (c) after reviewing the assessment, the chief executive is satisfied that, owing to a change in circumstances of that person or his or her spouse or partner, the assessment is no longer an accurate reflection of that person's ability to pay for his or her home-based disability support services, to take effect from such date as the chief executive determines, being a date on or after the date on which the change may reasonably be held to have occurred.
    
    (8) In any case where the chief executive is satisfied that any person---
        
    *   (a) who has applied for an assessment under this section; or
    
    *   (b) whose ability to pay for home-based disability support services has been assessed under this section---

    (4) If the chief executive is unable to ascertain which of the parents has the greater responsibility for the child or which of them was the principal caregiver before the parents began living apart, the parents shall agree between themselves as to which of them shall be entitled to have that child taken into account by the chief executive in assessing entitlement to a benefit and the rate of benefit payable; and until the parents reach agreement the child shall not be taken into account in assessing the entitlement to a benefit of, or the rate of benefit payable to, either parent.

    *   (a) may be given orally or in writing (but, if given orally, must as soon as practicable be confirmed in writing); and
    
    *   (b) may from time to time be amended, revoked, or revoked and replaced by the chief executive, to recognise changes in preferred suppliers or preferred supply contracts ending without also being replaced.

    *   (b) the beneficiary cannot withdraw from the redirection arrangement arising from that request unless the chief executive, in his or her discretion, considers a withdrawal during the identified period is justified by special circumstances established to the chief executive's satisfaction.

    (3) The amount for income tax payable on a source deduction payment is the amount of the tax deduction that would be made, at the rate determined under the appropriate specified provision, if the payment were increased by an amount that, after the tax deduction were made, would result in an amount equal to the source deduction payment.
    
    (4) An amount for income tax paid to the Commissioner under subsection (2) must,---
        
    *   (a) for the purposes of this Act, be considered to be a payment of a benefit, within the meaning of that term in [section 3(1)][7], made on account of, and received by, the person; and
    
    *   (b) for the purposes of---

        *   (iv) the [Income Tax Act 2007][579], be considered to be income of the person.
        
        
    
    (5) If, as a result of the review, suspension, cancellation, or termination of an income-tested benefit, the chief executive determines that an amount for tax on the benefit has been paid in accordance with this section to the Commissioner in excess of the amount that is properly payable under this section, the chief executive may not recover the excess amount as a debt due to the Crown within the meaning of [section 85A][315], but may recover that amount by---
        
    *   (a) making an adjustment to any amount subsequently payable to the Commissioner under subsection (2) in respect of the source deduction payments for that or any other benefit payable to that beneficiary; or

    (5) If on the death of the spouse or partner of any beneficiary it is found that for any reason, including the receipt of any income or the possession of any property by the deceased during her or his lifetime, the beneficiary has been granted a benefit to which he or she was not by law entitled or has been granted a benefit of an amount to which he or she was not by law entitled, an amount, to be assessed by the chief executive, equal to the total amount paid to the beneficiary in excess of the amount (if any) to which he or she was by law entitled shall constitute a debt owing to the Crown by the estate of the spouse or partner, and may be recovered accordingly at the suit of the chief executive.

    *   (d) in determining the application, the court shall accept any date determined by the chief executive for the purposes of subsection (6) as the date on which any property was in the possession of the deceased, unless the court is satisfied from the evidence produced that some other date should be fixed.
    
    (9) In determining any such application, the court may either confirm or cancel the assessment or increase or reduce the amount thereof or make such order as it considers just and equitable in the circumstances.
    
    (9A) The chief executive may not recover any sum comprising that part of a debt that was caused wholly or partly by an error to which the debtor did not intentionally contribute if---
        
    *   (a) the debtor---

    (1A) For the avoidance of doubt, it is declared that a deduction notice may be issued under subsection (1), despite the fact that the debt to the Crown under this Act may not be recovered by civil action in a court of law because of the [Limitation Act 2010][1018].
    
    (1B) A deduction notice may be issued under subsection (1) to the Accident Compensation Corporation requiring the Corporation to deduct the amount due from any weekly compensation in respect of loss of earnings or loss of potential earning capacity that is payable, or becomes payable, to the debtor by the Corporation under the [Accident Compensation Act 2001][882].

    (3) The chief executive shall specify in the deduction notice---
        
    *   (a) whether the deduction is to be made as a lump sum or by instalments; and
    
    *   (b) the time or times by which the person to whom the deduction notice is issued must pay the amounts deducted to the department; and
    
    *   (c) the date on which the deduction notice shall take effect, being a date not earlier than the date on which it was issued.
    
    (4) The chief executive may revoke a deduction notice at any time by giving notice in writing to the person to whom the deduction notice was issued, or by issuing a new deduction notice, and, at the request of the debtor, the chief executive shall revoke the deduction notice if he or she is satisfied that the amount due has been paid.
    
    (5) The chief executive shall issue a copy of the deduction notice to the debtor at his or her last known place of residence or business.
    
    (6) Every person to whom a deduction notice is issued shall, on request, issue to the debtor a statement in writing of any amount deducted, and of the purpose for which it was made.
    
    (7) Every deduction notice shall be subject to [sections 86G to 86I][323].

    *   (d) for each additional month or part of a month the amount in default or any part thereof that has not been deducted or, as the case may be, has not been paid to the department, a further penalty of the greater of 2% of that amount or part thereof or $1\.
    
    (2) Where any penalty is payable by any person under subsection (1), the chief executive, in his or her discretion, may remit the whole or part of that penalty where he or she is satisfied that the failure to make the deduction or make the payment was due to circumstances reasonably beyond the person's control, or that in all circumstances, the imposition of that penalty would be inequitable; and, where the debtor has already paid any penalty under this section, the chief executive may refund any excess.
    
    (3) An amount payable to the department under subsection (1) may be recovered under [section 86][316] as if it were money payable under a benefit to which the person was not entitled.

    > 
    > is the personal allowance.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Social Security Act 1964\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 17 April 2013, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][1254] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][1255] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][1256] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][1257] and [17E][1258] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
