    (8) In this section, _information matching programme_ means the comparison of information obtained pursuant to subsection (1) with other personal information held by the department for the purpose of producing or verifying information about an identifiable individual; and expressions otherwise defined in [section 97][748] of the Privacy Act 1993 shall have the meanings so defined, with any necessary modifications.

*   (1) The chief executive, in consultation with the Privacy Commissioner appointed under the [Privacy Act 1993][750], must, within 3 months after the commencement of this section, issue a code of conduct that applies in respect of requirements to supply information or documents under [section 11(1)][25], and the chief executive, and every officer of the department acting under the delegation of the chief executive must comply with that code of conduct in relation to making any such requirement.
    
    (2) The code of conduct---
        
    *   (a) must include the matters specified in [section 11C][28]; and

    (4) Nothing in the code of conduct may derogate from any code of practice issued by the Privacy Commissioner under [Part 6][751] of the Privacy Act 1993 that applies to the information required under [section 11][25], and the chief executive, in consultation with the Privacy Commissioner, must amend the code of conduct to conform with any such code of practice. This subsection is affected by subsection (5).
    
    (5) Without limiting the general power to make regulations conferred by [section 132][481], the Governor-General may, on the advice of the Minister given after consultation with the Privacy Commissioner, by Order in Council, make regulations under that section authorising the chief executive to obtain---

    *   (b) a provision prohibiting a requirement under [section 11(1)][25] being made in respect of a beneficiary to any person (not being the beneficiary, an employer or former employer of the beneficiary, a financial institution, or a law practitioner) unless there is reasonable cause to make a requirement under that section:

##### 11D Application process for benefits
    
*   (1) A benefit must not be granted to an applicant unless the requirement stated in subsection (2) has been complied with.
    
    (2) The requirement referred to in subsection (1) is that the department has received---
        
    *   (a) an application form (provided by the chief executive for the purpose) completed by or on behalf of the applicant and his or her spouse or partner (if any) to the chief executive's satisfaction; and
    
    *   (b) any supporting evidence (for example, a medical certificate) reasonably required by the chief executive.
    
    (3) The form referred to in subsection (2)(a) does not have to refer to a benefit of any particular kind.
    
    (3A) If the chief executive considers that the appropriate benefit for an applicant is a youth support payment, he or she may require as supporting evidence under subsection (2)(b) evidence of the applicant's accommodation costs and service costs (within the meaning of [section 157][532]), debts, and other liabilities.
    
    (3B) Subsection (3A) does not limit the generality of subsection (2)(b).
    
    (4) The receipt by the department of a completed application form relating to a benefit of one kind is sufficient compliance with subsection (2)(a) to enable the granting of a benefit of another kind.
    
    (5) The chief executive---
        
    *   (a) may waive all or part of a requirement to provide information under this section if satisfied that the department---
            
        *   (i) already holds the information concerned; or
        
        *   (ii) already holds enough other information to determine the matter for which the information concerned is needed; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) may waive the requirement to complete an application form if satisfied that the department already holds a form relating to an application that has lapsed under subsection (8).
    
    (6) Subsection (1) is subject to subsection (5) and to [section 81(3) and (4)][324].
    
    (7) If the requirement stated in subsection (2) has been complied with, an application for a benefit must for the purposes of [sections 80][311] and [80BA][315] be treated as having been received on the date of first contact.
    
    (8) An application for a benefit lapses at the close of the period of 20 working days after the date of first contact (as from time to time extended under subsection (10)) unless, within the period, the requirement stated in subsection (2) has been complied with.
    
    (9) Subsection (8) does not apply to an application for a benefit made by a person ordinarily resident in an overseas country to the competent authority of that country pursuant to an agreement or convention given effect in relation to New Zealand by an Order in Council made pursuant to [section 19][602] of the Social Welfare (Reciprocity Agreements, and New Zealand Artificial Limb Service) Act 1990\.
    
    (10) Before or after the expiration of the period referred to in subsection (8), the chief executive may extend that period, if in any particular case he or she thinks that there is a good and sufficient reason for non-compliance with the requirement stated in subsection (2) within that period.
    
    (11) The combined effect of subsections (1) and (8) is that an applicant whose application for a benefit has lapsed cannot become entitled to the benefit without applying for it again and establishing his or her eligibility to receive it.
    
    (12) This section is subject to [sections 11E][31], [11G][33], and [11H][34].

    *   (a) is receiving sole parent support, a supported living payment, jobseeker support, or an emergency benefit (whether in his or her own right, or as the spouse or partner of the person granted the benefit); and
    
    *   (b) is already a caregiver, or the principal caregiver, of a dependent child or children.
    
    (1A) Subsection (1) does not apply to a person at a time when---
        
    *   (a) there is in force under [section 19(1)][602] of the Social Welfare (Reciprocity Agreements, and New Zealand Artificial Limb Service) Act 1990 an order declaring that the provisions contained in an agreement or convention with the government of another country set out in a schedule to the order have force and effect so far as they relate to New Zealand; and
    
    *   (b) he or she is ordinarily resident in that country.
    
    (2) An additional dependent child aged 1 or over must not be included in the determination for the purposes of the definitions of _part-time work-tested beneficiary_, _work-tested sole parent support beneficiary_, and _work-tested spouse or partner_ in [section 3(1)][7] and [section 60Q(1)][207] or for the purposes of [section 20D(1)(c)][71] (which relates to eligibility for sole parent support) of---

    (3) Subsection (2) may apply to 2 or more additional dependent children of the same beneficiary parent.
    
    (3A) In applying subsection (2) to a beneficiary of a kind specified in one of the following paragraphs for the purposes only of [section 20D(1)(c)][71] (which relates to eligibility for sole parent support), ""An additional dependent child aged 1 or over"" must be read as ""An additional dependent child at all times after that child is born"":

    *   (a) the person's situation is analogous to that of a person to whom subsection (1) applies; or
    
    *   (b) to do so would best achieve the purpose stated in [section 60GAD][184].

    (2C) For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in paragraph (b) of subsection (2B) prevents the payment of a disability allowance to a person to whom that paragraph applies for expenses that are not costs of residential care services supplied to that person.
    
    (3) Before a disability allowance is granted under this section, the chief executive may require the applicant, or the spouse or partner or child of the applicant, as the case may require, to be examined by a medical practitioner nominated by the chief executive for the purpose.
    
    (4) Despite anything to the contrary in this section, the chief executive may, in the chief executive's discretion, refuse to grant a disability allowance or may terminate a disability allowance already granted or may grant a disability allowance at a reduced rate, if the applicant is in receipt of a war disablement pension under the [War Pensions Act 1954][618], or an entitlement under the [Accident Compensation Act 2001][949], or an overseas pension or periodical allowance which the chief executive deems to be analogous to such war disablement pension or entitlement, in respect of a disability which gives rise to an application for a disability allowance under this section.
    
    (5) Notwithstanding anything in this section but subject to [section 68A][277], if---
        
    *   (a) a person who is married or in a civil union or in a de facto relationship (the _recipient_) is in receipt of New Zealand superannuation or a veteran's pension, or of a supported living payment on the ground of sickness, injury, disability, or total blindness, or jobseeker support, or a related emergency benefit; and
    
    *   (b) the recipient's spouse or partner is either---
            
        *   (i) a patient in a hospital (as defined in [section 75(1)][303]) who is in receipt of a reduced benefit under section 75(3) or (4); or
        
        *   (ii) a resident assessed as requiring care (as defined in [section 136][505]), and in respect of whom a funder (as defined in that section) is paying some or all of the cost of contracted care services (as defined in that section) under [section 141][512] or [142][513],---
        
        
    
    *   (c) \[Repealed\]
    
    the chief executive shall grant a special disability allowance at the rate specified in [Schedule 19][581] to the recipient for the purpose of defraying expenses arising from the hospitalisation of the spouse or partner.
    
    (6) Despite subsection (2)(a), the chief executive may grant a disability allowance under this section to any person who would otherwise qualify for it and---
        
    *   (a) whose life expectancy is less than 6 months; or
    
    *   (b) it is not possible to determine whether the disability is likely to continue for not less than 6 months but that is a reasonably possible prognosis.
    
    (7) Where any person, whose application for a disability allowance has been declined only on the grounds that the disability is likely to last less than 6 months, subsequently shows to the satisfaction of the chief executive that the disability in respect of which that application was made---
        
    *   (a) is likely to last for 6 months or more; or
    
    *   (b) has continued for 6 months or more,---
    
    and that the person would otherwise have been entitled to receive a disability allowance since the date of the original application, the chief executive must grant a disability allowance to that person commencing on the date of the original application.
    
    (7A) This subsection applies to a person if---
        
    *   (a) any additional expenses arising from a disability relate to the supply of any goods or services to the person or a member of the person's family; and
    
    *   (b) all or a specified part of a disability allowance is granted in respect of the supply of the goods or services; and
    
    *   (c) those goods or services are of a class, description, or kind supplied by a preferred supplier (being a preferred supplier to, or in respect of, the area in which the person resides) under a contract entered into with the chief executive under [section 125AA][447].
    
    (7B) If subsection (7A) applies to a person,---
        
    *   (a) the person must, for every supply of the goods or services after a nomination given to the person by the chief executive has come into force and while it remains in force, purchase the goods or services from a preferred supplier specified in that nomination and at the price determined by the contract under [section 125AA][447] with that supplier; and
    
    *   (b) the chief executive must, despite subsections (1) to (7), pay all, or the specified part, of the disability allowance that is granted in respect of the supply of the goods or services to that supplier in consideration of the supply of the goods or services to the person or the person's family member.
    
    (7BA) A nomination under subsection (7B)(a)---
        
    *   (a) may be given orally or in writing (but, if given orally, must as soon as practicable be confirmed in writing); and
    
    *   (b) may from time to time be amended, revoked, or revoked and replaced by the chief executive, to recognise changes in preferred suppliers or preferred supply contracts ending without also being replaced.
    
    (7BB) However, if the person's net total benefit payments due to be paid on a pay day (after deducting any redirection under [section 82(3)][325] or reduction or deduction required to be made from the person's benefit payments for another purpose (for example, under an attachment order or a deduction notice)) are less than the amount required to pay the preferred supplier on that pay day, the chief executive---
        
    *   (a) is not required by subsection (7B)(b) to pay to the preferred supplier on that pay day all, or the specified part, of the person's disability allowance due on that pay day; but
    
    *   (b) may pay the amount due to the preferred supplier on 1 or more later pay days from amounts of disability allowance or other benefit payments due to the person on those 1 or more later pay days.
    
    (7BC) Non-payment, or deferred payment, under subsection (7BB) does not reduce any amounts due to the preferred supplier from the person under, or make the chief executive or the Crown liable for breaching, the person's contract of purchase.
    
    (7C) However, if the disability allowance granted to the person to whom subsection (7A) applies is granted at the maximum appropriate rate specified in [Schedule 19][581], the chief executive may, in the chief executive's discretion, determine in writing that, despite subsection (7B),---
        
    *   (a) all, or the specified part, of the disability allowance that is granted in respect of the supply of the goods or services must be paid to the person for use only to purchase any 1 or more of the goods or services that the person chooses and that are goods or services in respect of the supply of which the disability allowance is granted; and
    
    *   (b) if the goods or services that the person chooses and purchases under paragraph (a) are goods or services supplied by the nominated preferred supplier under the contract entered into with the chief executive under [section 125AA][447], then the person must purchase them from that supplier at the price determined by that contract.
    
    (7D) No appeal under this Act lies against any chief executive's decision under subsections (7B) to (7C).
    
    (7E) Subsections (7A) to (7D) are subject to (preferred supplier transitional provisions) directions under [section 125AA(5)][447].
    
    (8) In this section,---
    
    _disability_ has the meaning ascribed to it by [section 21(1)(h)][950] of the Human Rights Act 1993
    
    _health practitioner_---
        
    *   (a) has the same meaning as in [section 5(1)][951] of the Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003; and
    
    *   (b) includes---
            
        *   (i) a former health practitioner within the meaning of that section; and
        
        *   (ii) a person who is receiving training or gaining experience under the supervision of a health practitioner.

    (5) In any case where the chief executive is satisfied that a person to whom this section applies, or that person's spouse or partner, has not realised any assets available for that person's personal use, the chief executive may treat any such assets as being cash assets for the purposes of subsection (4).
    
    (6) Every assessment made by the chief executive under subsection (3) must state---

    (8) In any case where the chief executive is satisfied that any person---
        
    *   (a) who has applied for an assessment under this section; or
    
    *   (b) whose ability to pay for home-based disability support services has been assessed under this section---

    (9) Every person whose ability to pay for home-based disability support services has been assessed under this section must forthwith advise the department of any change in the circumstances of that person or his or her spouse or partner that affects that person's ability to pay for his or her home-based disability support services.

##### 75B Effect on benefit of warrant to arrest beneficiary
    
*   (1) This section applies to a beneficiary who is not an excluded beneficiary (as defined in subsection (2)) if the chief executive is satisfied (based on information available to the chief executive) that---
        
    *   (a) criminal proceedings have been commenced against the beneficiary in a New Zealand court for an offence (other than an offence of a class, description, or kind excluded from the operation of this paragraph by regulations made under [section 132L][497]); and

    (2) _Excluded beneficiary_, in subsection (1), means,---

        *   (iii) a beneficiary (for example, one who is receiving a main benefit under this Act, New Zealand superannuation, or a veteran's pension, but) who falls within a class, description, or kind of beneficiary excluded from the operation of all of the provisions of this section by regulations made under [section 132L][497]; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) for the purposes of subsections (7) and (8), a beneficiary who is---

    (3) The chief executive must as soon as practicable give the beneficiary a notice (to be delivered in accordance with [section 86J][343]) that---
        
    *   (a) allows a period of 10 working days within which the beneficiary may dispute that he or she is the person to whom the warrant to arrest applies or take steps to resolve the warrant; and
    
    *   (b) specifies the steps that the beneficiary may take to dispute that he or she is the person to whom the warrant to arrest applies or to resolve the warrant; and
    
    *   (c) specifies the consequences of the beneficiary's not resolving the warrant within that 10-working-day period.
    
    (4) A notice under subsection (3) involving information supplied by the Ministry of Justice under [section 126AC][464] may be combined with a notice of adverse action given under [section 103(1)][749] of the Privacy Act 1993\.
    
    (5) This subsection applies to the beneficiary unless, at the end of the 10-working-day period specified in the notice, the chief executive is satisfied (based on evidence provided by the beneficiary, or other information available to the chief executive, or both) of 1 of the following:
        
    *   (a) that the beneficiary is not the person to whom the warrant applies; or
    
    *   (b) that the beneficiary has taken all reasonable steps to resolve the warrant, but the warrant has for reasons beyond the beneficiary's control not been resolved; or
    
    *   (c) that the warrant has been resolved.
    
    (6) The benefit of a beneficiary to whom subsection (5) applies is not payable until the chief executive is satisfied (based on information provided by the beneficiary, otherwise available to the chief executive, or both) of 1 of the following:
        
    *   (a) that the beneficiary is not the person to whom the warrant applies; or
    
    *   (b) that the warrant has been resolved.
    
    (7) Despite subsections (1)(c) and (3) to (6), the chief executive may suspend immediately the benefit of a beneficiary to whom subsection (1)(a) and (b) apply if satisfied that---
        
    *   (a) the department has received from the New Zealand Police a written request to suspend the beneficiary's benefit on the ground that the Commissioner of Police on reasonable grounds considers the beneficiary to be a risk to public safety; and
    
    *   (b) that request is signed by the Commissioner of Police or a constable who is of or above the level of position of inspector.
    
    (8) As soon as is reasonably practicable after a suspension under subsection (7) of the benefit of a beneficiary, the chief executive must give the beneficiary a notice (to be delivered in accordance with [section 86J][343]) that---
        
    *   (a) communicates the fact of, and reason for, the suspension; and
    
    *   (b) specifies the steps that the beneficiary may take to dispute that he or she is the person to whom the warrant applies or to resolve the warrant.
    
    (9) The following apply to a benefit that is not payable under subsection (6), or that is suspended under subsection (7), as if the benefit had been suspended under [section 117][424]:
        
    *   (a) [section 80C][321] (effect of work test on entitlement to supplementary benefits and on spouses or partners):
    
    *   (b) [section 120][427] (modified effect in some cases of sanctions on rate of benefit for people married or in civil union or de facto relationship):
    
    *   (c) [section 121][429] (effect of sanctions on benefit of sole parent).
    
    (10) However, [section 120(1)][427] (which protects a spouse or partner), but no other provision of section 120, ceases to apply under subsection (9)(b) to the benefit at the close of the 28th day after the date on which it becomes not payable under subsection (6) or, as the case requires, is suspended under subsection (7).

    (2) If a person in receipt of New Zealand superannuation or a veteran's pension is so imprisoned or detained, the chief executive may, in the chief executive's discretion, continue payment of New Zealand superannuation or a veteran's pension for 2 pay days after the date of imprisonment or detention.
    
    (3) The chief executive may, in the chief executive's discretion, pay all or any part of the benefit to the spouse or partner of a beneficiary who has been so imprisoned or detained, or who has escaped from such imprisonment or detention, or to any responsible person for the benefit of the spouse or partner or of any dependent child or children of such a beneficiary.
    
    (4) If a beneficiary is remanded in custody by a court pending a further appearance before a court, his benefit shall not be payable in respect of any period during which he is so in custody, but the chief executive may in the chief executive's discretion pay all or any part of the benefit in respect of that period after having regard to the beneficiary's financial circumstances and commitments.
    
    (5) For the purposes of this section, the chief executive may in the chief executive's discretion regard as a period of imprisonment or detention in a prison, or a period of remand in custody, any period during which a person is a patient in a hospital within the meaning of [section 75(1)][303] while serving a sentence of imprisonment, preventive detention, or corrective training, or while remanded in custody.
    
    (6) For the purposes of this section, a person shall still be considered to be imprisoned or detained if he or she has been released from a prison, for any purpose authorised by the [Corrections Act 2004][1015], for a period not exceeding 24 hours.

    (2) A benefit is payable to a beneficiary in respect of any 1 or more absences of the beneficiary from New Zealand equal to or shorter than 4 weeks in total in any 52-week period if---
        
    *   (a) the benefit is not a benefit of a kind specified in subsection (2A); and
    
    *   (b) the benefit would, but for those 1 or more absences, be payable to the beneficiary; and
    
    *   (c) the chief executive is satisfied that the 1 or more absences do not affect the beneficiary's eligibility for the benefit.
    
    (2A) The kinds of benefits referred to in subsections (2)(a) and (3)(a) are---
        
    *   (a) sole parent support for a work-tested beneficiary:

    *   (e) a youth payment or young parent payment.
    
    (3) The chief executive may, in the chief executive's discretion, pay a benefit to a beneficiary in respect of any 1 or more absences of the beneficiary from New Zealand equal to or shorter than 4 weeks in total in any 52-week period if---
        
    *   (a) the benefit is a benefit of a kind specified in subsection (2A); and
    
    *   (b) the benefit would, but for those 1 or more absences, be payable to the beneficiary; and
    
    *   (c) the chief executive is satisfied that the payment of the benefit complies with any applicable criteria prescribed for the purposes of this subsection by regulations made under [section 132][481].
    
    (3AA) If satisfied that relevant qualifying circumstances (as defined for the purposes of this subsection by regulations made under [section 132][481]) apply to or in respect of a beneficiary, the chief executive may, in the chief executive's discretion, determine that a benefit may be paid under subsection (2) or (3) in respect of any 1 or more absences of the beneficiary from New Zealand longer than 4 weeks in total in any 52-week period.
    
    (3A) The chief executive may, in the chief executive's discretion, pay a supported living payment on the ground of sickness, injury, disability, or total blindness for a period (not exceeding 6 weeks) in which a beneficiary (not being a work-tested spouse or partner of a supported living payment beneficiary) is absent from New Zealand for the sole or predominant purpose of competing in any overseas multinational or international Special Olympic or Paralympic Games competition, if the chief executive is satisfied that the beneficiary would, but for his or her absence from New Zealand, continue to be eligible for the supported living payment.
    
    (4) The chief executive may, in the chief executive's discretion, pay a benefit to any person who would otherwise be entitled to receive it, but who is absent from New Zealand for any period or periods not exceeding 2 years in total because---
        
    *   (a) that person or his or her spouse or partner, dependent child, or sibling is receiving medical treatment overseas for which the Ministry of Health is granting assistance; or
    
    *   (b) the person is in receipt of a supported living payment granted on the grounds of his or her sickness, injury, disability, or total blindness, and is absent from New Zealand in order to receive vocational training or disability assistance-dog training; and the chief executive is satisfied that---

        *   (ii) the person could not obtain the training in New Zealand during the period or periods of absence.
        
        
    
    (5) For the purposes of this section, if a person who is absent from New Zealand would have become entitled to a benefit during his or her absence but for subsection (1), the person's absence shall be regarded as having commenced on the day he or she would have become so entitled.
    
    (6) A beneficiary who proposes to be absent from New Zealand has a duty imposed by this subsection to notify an officer of the department, before that absence, of the beneficiary's forthcoming absence from New Zealand. No beneficiary has any entitlement under subsection (2), (3), (3AA), (3A), or (4) to be paid a benefit while overseas unless that beneficiary has performed that duty, and therefore notified an officer of the department, before that absence, of the beneficiary's forthcoming absence.
    
    (7) In particular, if the beneficiary fails to perform his or her duty to notify under subsection (6), and after departing from New Zealand notifies an officer of the department of the beneficiary's current absence from New Zealand, the beneficiary's entitlement under subsection (2), (3), (3AA), (3A), or (4) to be paid a benefit while overseas (if the beneficiary is otherwise qualified to be paid that benefit) commences no earlier than the date of the notification.
    
    (8) Despite subsections (6) and (7), the chief executive may, in his or her discretion, authorise the beneficiary's entitlement under subsection (2), (3), (3AA), (3A), or (4) to commence on or after the beneficiary's departure if the chief executive is satisfied that---
        
    *   (a) both the beneficiary's absence from New Zealand, and the beneficiary's failure to notify an officer of the department, before that absence, of the beneficiary's forthcoming absence from New Zealand, are justified for 1 or more good and sufficient humanitarian reasons (as the term humanitarian reasons is defined for the purposes of this paragraph by regulations made under [section 132][481]); and
    
    *   (b) the beneficiary after departing from New Zealand notified an officer of the department of the beneficiary's current absence from New Zealand as soon as was reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
    
    (9) Nothing in subsections (2) to (8) applies to the following:
        
    *   (a) New Zealand superannuation payable under the [New Zealand Superannuation and Retirement Income Act 2001][603]:
    
    *   (b) veterans' pensions payable under [Part 6][604] of the War Pensions Act 1954:

    (3) The amount for income tax payable on a source deduction payment is the amount of the tax deduction that would be made, at the rate determined under the appropriate specified provision, if the payment were increased by an amount that, after the tax deduction were made, would result in an amount equal to the source deduction payment.

    (5) If, as a result of the review, suspension, cancellation, or termination of an income-tested benefit, the chief executive determines that an amount for tax on the benefit has been paid in accordance with this section to the Commissioner in excess of the amount that is properly payable under this section, the chief executive may not recover the excess amount as a debt due to the Crown within the meaning of [section 85A][332], but may recover that amount by---
        
    *   (a) making an adjustment to any amount subsequently payable to the Commissioner under subsection (2) in respect of the source deduction payments for that or any other benefit payable to that beneficiary; or

    (2) Subject to subsections (2A) and (2B), if any person has obtained any payment or received any credit or advance referred to in [section 85A][332] in excess of the amount to which he or she was entitled and, in the opinion of the chief executive, that payment or credit or advance in excess was obtained by fraud, the chief executive may, in his or her discretion, which discretion may be exercised in respect of any particular case or class or classes of case, recover from that person, by way of penalty, an amount not exceeding 3 times the amount in excess. Nothing in this subsection shall relieve that person from any other liability in respect of any fraud committed by him or her. Any penalty under this subsection may be recovered by way of deduction from any instalments of the same or any other benefit or student allowance or payment thereafter becoming payable to that person under this Act or under [section 124(1)(d)][445] or under [Part 6][604] of the War Pensions Act 1954 or under the [New Zealand Superannuation and Retirement Income Act 2001][603]; and may be recovered as a debt due to the Crown at the suit of the chief executive.
    
    (2A) The chief executive shall not impose any penalty on any person under subsection (2)---
        
    *   (a) unless the chief executive has given to the person written notice---
            
        *   (i) specifying the intention to impose a penalty under that subsection and the amount proposed to be imposed by way of penalty; and
        
        *   (ii) specifying the particulars of fact on which the intention is based; and
        
        *   (iii) stating the person has 5 working days from the receipt of the notice to show cause why the action should not be taken; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) if that person has been prosecuted and dealt with for any offence arising out of the same circumstances that gave rise to liability under that subsection; and
    
    *   (c) until the expiration of those 5 working days.
    
    (2B) Where the chief executive imposes any penalty under subsection (2), no action to recover that penalty shall be taken until any review of that decision under [section 10A][21] or any appeal under [section 12J][47] has been completed.
    
    (2C) In subsection (2), a person shall be considered to have obtained a payment or credit or advance by fraud if that person has made any statement knowing it to be false in any material particular, or has knowingly said or done anything or omitted to do or say anything for the purpose of misleading any officer concerned in the administration of this Act, for the purpose of obtaining a payment or credit or advance under this Act, as a result of which that person received that payment or credit or advance.
    
    (3) If, in the opinion of the chief executive, the spouse or partner of any beneficiary makes any false statement to or otherwise misleads any officer engaged in the administration of this Act, in relation to his or her income or other personal circumstances, as a result of which the benefit or an instalment of benefit is paid in excess of the amount to which the beneficiary is by law entitled, the amount so paid in excess may be recovered from that spouse or partner as a debt due to the Crown at the suit of the chief executive, or the excess payment may be recovered by way of deduction from any instalments of any benefit or student allowance thereafter becoming payable to that spouse or partner.
    
    (4) If on the death of any beneficiary he is found to have been disqualified for any reason, including the receipt of any income or the possession of any property, from obtaining the benefit granted to him or from obtaining a benefit of the amount granted to him, an amount, to be assessed by the chief executive, equal to the total amount paid to the beneficiary in excess of the amount (if any) to which he was by law entitled shall constitute a debt owing to the Crown by the estate of the beneficiary, and may be recovered accordingly at the suit of the chief executive.
    
    (5) If on the death of the spouse or partner of any beneficiary it is found that for any reason, including the receipt of any income or the possession of any property by the deceased during her or his lifetime, the beneficiary has been granted a benefit to which he or she was not by law entitled or has been granted a benefit of an amount to which he or she was not by law entitled, an amount, to be assessed by the chief executive, equal to the total amount paid to the beneficiary in excess of the amount (if any) to which he or she was by law entitled shall constitute a debt owing to the Crown by the estate of the spouse or partner, and may be recovered accordingly at the suit of the chief executive.
    
    (6) For the purpose of determining for the purposes of subsection (4) or subsection (5) the total amount paid to a beneficiary by way of benefit in excess of the amount (if any) to which he or she was by law entitled, any property that was in the possession of the beneficiary or of the spouse or partner of the beneficiary at his or her death shall, unless in proceedings for the recovery of that excess (but subject to any decision by a District Court in any application under subsection (7)) the contrary is proved, be deemed to have been in his or her possession on such date as the chief executive determines, being not earlier than the date on which the benefit was first granted.
    
    (7) Notice in writing of every assessment by the chief executive under subsection (4) or subsection (5) shall be served on the executor or administrator of the estate of the deceased beneficiary or, as the case may be, of the deceased spouse or partner of the beneficiary, and the executor or administrator may, within 1 month after the service of the notice, apply to a District Court to review the assessment and any decision of the chief executive under subsection (6) in relation to that assessment.
    
    (8) The following provisions shall apply with respect to every such application:
        
    *   (a) the court shall have jurisdiction with respect to the application irrespective of the amount of the assessment:
    
    *   (b) the application shall not be heard in open court:
    
    *   (c) the court may receive as evidence any statement, document, information, or matter that may in its opinion assist the court to deal effectively with the application, whether or not the same would be otherwise admissible in a court of law:
    
    *   (d) in determining the application, the court shall accept any date determined by the chief executive for the purposes of subsection (6) as the date on which any property was in the possession of the deceased, unless the court is satisfied from the evidence produced that some other date should be fixed.
    
    (9) In determining any such application, the court may either confirm or cancel the assessment or increase or reduce the amount thereof or make such order as it considers just and equitable in the circumstances.
    
    (9A) The chief executive may not recover any sum comprising that part of a debt that was caused wholly or partly by an error to which the debtor did not intentionally contribute if---
        
    *   (a) the debtor---
            
        *   (i) received that sum in good faith; and
        
        *   (ii) changed his or her position in the belief that he or she was entitled to that sum and would not have to pay or repay that sum to the chief executive; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) it would be inequitable in all the circumstances, including the debtor's financial circumstances, to permit recovery.
    
    (9B) In subsection (9A), _error_---
        
    *   (a) means---
            
        *   (i) the provision of incorrect information by an officer of the department:
        
        *   (ii) any erroneous act or omission of an officer of the department that occurs during an investigation under [section 12][35]:
        
        *   (iii) any other erroneous act or omission of an officer of the department; but
        
        
    
    *   (b) does not include the simple act of making a payment to which the recipient is not entitled if that act is not caused, wholly or partly, by any erroneous act or omission of an officer of the department.

    *   (a) on his or her or its own account; or
    
    *   (b) as an agent; or
    
    *   (c) as a trustee; or

    (1A) For the avoidance of doubt, it is declared that a deduction notice may be issued under subsection (1), despite the fact that the debt to the Crown under this Act may not be recovered by civil action in a court of law because of the [Limitation Act 2010][1097].
    
    (1B) A deduction notice may be issued under subsection (1) to the Accident Compensation Corporation requiring the Corporation to deduct the amount due from any weekly compensation in respect of loss of earnings or loss of potential earning capacity that is payable, or becomes payable, to the debtor by the Corporation under the [Accident Compensation Act 2001][949].
    
    (1C) A deduction notice under subsection (1) may be issued to recover---

    *   (b) any amount of maintenance debt (within the meaning of [section 61CA][230]).
    
    (2) The chief executive shall not issue a deduction notice under subsection (1) unless the chief executive has taken all reasonable steps to recover the debt, but nothing in this subsection shall require the chief executive to take proceedings in any court to recover the debt before issuing a deduction notice.
    
    (3) The chief executive shall specify in the deduction notice---
        
    *   (a) whether the deduction is to be made as a lump sum or by instalments; and
    
    *   (b) the time or times by which the person to whom the deduction notice is issued must pay the amounts deducted to the department; and
    
    *   (c) the date on which the deduction notice shall take effect, being a date not earlier than the date on which it was issued.
    
    (4) The chief executive may revoke a deduction notice at any time by giving notice in writing to the person to whom the deduction notice was issued, or by issuing a new deduction notice, and, at the request of the debtor, the chief executive shall revoke the deduction notice if he or she is satisfied that the amount due has been paid.
    
    (5) The chief executive shall issue a copy of the deduction notice to the debtor at his or her last known place of residence or business.
    
    (6) Every person to whom a deduction notice is issued shall, on request, issue to the debtor a statement in writing of any amount deducted, and of the purpose for which it was made.
    
    (7) Every deduction notice shall be subject to [sections 86G to 86I][340].

    *   (b) that assistance was either not supplied, or not supplied to the extent, or in the manner, specified by the department.
    
    (2) A beneficiary has for the purposes of [section 116B][422] a good and sufficient reason for not complying with a drug testing obligation under [section 102B(1)][392], or for failing to apply for suitable employment that requires candidates to undertake drug tests, or for both, if the chief executive is satisfied---
        
    *   (a) that the person is addicted to, or dependent on, 1 or more controlled drugs; or
    
    *   (b) that the person is undertaking treatment---
            
        *   (i) for addiction to, or dependence on, 1 or more controlled drugs; and
        
        *   (ii) provided by a health practitioner, or other person, who is professionally engaged in the treatment or rehabilitation of people using, or who have used, controlled drugs; and
        
        *   (iii) of a kind approved by the chief executive; or

    (4) This section does not limit the generality of [section 116B][422].

        *   (ii) if the person has not recomplied within 4 weeks after the date on which the reduction took effect, the person's benefit (unless it is not a main benefit under this Act) must be reduced by a further 50% (so that the total reduction is 100%) until the person recomplies:
        
        
    
    *   (b) for a second failure (being a failure that occurs after the person has recomplied following a first failure), suspension of the person's benefit (unless it is not a main benefit under this Act) until the person recomplies:
    
    *   (c) for a third failure (being a failure that occurs after the person has recomplied following a second failure), cancellation of the person's benefit (unless it is not a main benefit under this Act).

    (1C) Subsection (1B) applies whether the failure under [section 116B(1)(e)][422] and that is mentioned in subsection (1B) is for the purposes of subsection (1) a first, a second, or a third failure.

##### 119 Calculation of failure rate
    
*   (1) In calculating the number of failures under [section 117][424], the chief executive---
        
    *   (a) may count applicable failures only during a period of continuous payment in respect of the beneficiary of the same benefit or of 2 or more different benefits; and
    
    *   (ab) if the benefit being paid in respect of the beneficiary is a benefit (_benefit A_), may count applicable failures incurred while another benefit was earlier paid in respect of the beneficiary (_benefit B_) if benefit A and benefit B have been paid continuously in respect of the beneficiary; but
    
    *   (b) must not count a failure if---
            
        *   (i) it is not a failure of a kind to which [section 117][424] applies under [section 116B(1)][422]; or
        
        *   (ii) it occurred more than 12 months before the failure for which the calculation is made if, during that period, that beneficiary has not incurred a failure of a kind in [section 116B(1)][422] to which [section 117][424] applies.
        
        
    
    (1A) Subsections (1)(a) and (ab) and (3) apply only to 1 or more main benefits under this Act.
    
    (1B) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), 2 or more different benefits paid to a beneficiary do not give rise to a period of continuous payment in respect of the beneficiary of those 2 or more different benefits if---
        
    *   (a) one of those 2 or more different benefits is a youth payment or a young parent payment; and
    
    *   (b) the other of, or (as the case may be) the rest of, those 2 or more different benefits is any 1 or more or all of sole parent support, supported living payment, jobseeker support, and emergency benefit.
    
    (1C) Subsection (1B) does not limit or affect subsection (1)(a) applying (under [section 176(2)][555]) with all necessary modifications to the imposition of sanctions under [sections 173][552] and [174][553] in respect of failures---
        
    *   (a) by a young person receiving a youth payment or a young parent payment; and
    
    *   (b) that are failures, without good and sufficient reason, to comply with an obligation placed on him or her by [section 170][548]; and
    
    *   (c) during a period of continuous payment in respect of the young person of the same benefit (being a youth payment or a young parent payment) or of 2 or more different benefits (being a youth payment and a young parent payment, in whatever sequence paid).
    
    (2) For the purpose of subsection (1)(b)(ii), a failure under [section 116B][422] is considered to have occurred on the date the chief executive decides he or she is satisfied the beneficiary has failed, without a good and sufficient reason, to comply with the appropriate work test obligation or other obligation imposed by this Act.
    
    (3) In determining whether a benefit has been continuously paid in respect of the beneficiary, the chief executive must disregard any period during which the benefit was cancelled or suspended because the beneficiary commenced in employment that continued for less than 10 working days.
    
    (3A) For the purpose of subsection (1)(a), the chief executive must treat a specified benefit that expires under [section 80BE][319], and a specified benefit re-granted to the beneficiary under [section 80BF][320], as the same benefit.
    
    (4) Nothing in subsection (1)(b)(ii) affects the implementation, after the 12-month period, of a sanction based on any prior calculation of the number of failures by a person to comply with the appropriate work test obligation or other obligation imposed by this Act.
    
    (5) In this section, _working day_ means a day on which a person was required to work in the employment referred to in subsection (3).
    
    (6) This section is subject to [sections 113(2A)][416] and [117(1AA)][424] (which relate to 2 or more failures of a person to comply with 1 or more specified obligations under this Act being---
