    *   (a) specifying particulars of the discrepancy and of the action the chief executive proposes to take as a result of that discrepancy; and
    
    *   (b) specifying the unique identifiers assigned to that individual by the competent institutions of both countries; and

    *   (b) received for a purpose set out in subsection (4A)(c); and
    
    *   (c) matched against information held by the chief executive using the unique identifiers assigned to the individual concerned by the competent institutions of both countries.

    (6) Where the chief executive fails to comply, in relation to any individual, with the provisions of subsection (3)(c), the failure is considered, for the purposes of [Part 8][125] of the Privacy Act 1993, to constitute a failure to comply with the provisions of [Part 10][126] of that Act.
    
    (7) In this section, expressions defined in [section 97][127] of the Privacy Act 1993 have the meanings so defined, with any necessary modifications.
