##### 9 Validation of Nelson Borough Council election
    
*   Whereas, by Proclamation of the fifteenth day of June last, the several wards of the Borough of Nelson were abolished on the petition of not less than one-half of the burgesses thereof, and it thereupon became necessary to elect new members of the Council of such borough, and it was found that The Municipal Corporations Act 1876, did not make any provision in that behalf:
    
    And whereas, notwithstanding the absence of any authority in that behalf, an election of members of the Council of the said borough was held on the fifteenth day of July last past, whereat Edward Everett, Robert Levien, Alfred Coleman, Francis Trask, John Graham, Joseph Auty Harley, William Akersten, Thomas Hoyle Stringer, and Malcolm Mure Webster were declared duly elected:
    
    And whereas a burgess-roll for the purpose of such election was compiled from the burgess-rolls of the several wards of the said borough existing at the time of their abolition:
    
    And whereas also the said election was not held within the time limited in such cases by The Regulation of Local Elections Act 1876:
    
    And whereas the aforesaid election has been held from the necessity of the case, and not in wilful breach of the law, and it is expedient to validate the same:
    
    Be it therefore further enacted as follows:---
    
    All things done at the election of the members of the Council of the Borough of Nelson held on the fifteenth day of July last past, and the burgess-rolls prepared for the holding of such election, are hereby validated, and shall be deemed to have been done according to law.
    
    The several persons above mentioned as having been duly elected at such election are hereby confirmed in their election; and the burgess-roll prepared for such election is hereby validated, and shall be the burgess-roll for the said borough, and shall continue in force until a new roll is formed according to law.
    
    All persons taking any proceedings in or towards conducting the said election are hereby indemnified in respect of all things done therein or thereat which might have been lawfully done by them respectively had such election not been illegal.

##### 10 Validation of Devonport Borough rate
    
*   Whereas the former Road District of Devonport has during the now current year been proclaimed a borough, and the Road Board of the aforesaid district, by reason of not having received a valuation-roll, did not make and levy any rate within the said district for the current year previous to the conversion of such district into a borough, but thereafter, that is to say, on the fifteenth day of June, did make a rate therein, which however there is no authority in law to collect: And whereas the Borough Council of the new borough, by reason of there being no valuation-roll in force therein, and otherwise, is precluded from levying rates therein: And whereas it is expedient that the said Borough Council should be specially authorized to make and levy rates in the said borough for the present year in the place of the rates which should have been made and levied therein by the aforesaid Road Board, and for that purpose and to avoid expense it is expedient to legalize the rate made as aforesaid by the Road Board, and to authorize the Borough Council to collect the same as a borough rate:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:---
    
    Notwithstanding that the Borough of Devonport was constituted after the fifteenth day of January in the now current year, the Borough Council thereof may levy and make rates to all intents and purposes as if such borough had been constituted before the aforesaid fifteenth day of January; and, in the place of the borough rates which cannot be made, may make and levy in the said borough for the now current year all such rates as might have been made and levied therein by the Road Board of the Road District of Devonport had such borough not been constituted; and all such rates shall be deemed to be borough rates.
    
    The rate made by the Road Board of the Road District of Devonport on the fifteenth day of June last past is hereby validated, and shall be deemed to be a borough rate as if it had been made by the Council of the Borough of Devonport; and the said Council is hereby authorized to collect the said rate, and shall have all powers and authorities for enforcing payment thereof as if it had been made by the said Council in the first instance.
    
    The Governor in Council shall be deemed to be empowered under The Rating Act 1876, to fix all times and to authorize all things to be done to enable a first valuation-roll for such borough to be made, or for such rates to be levied, as nearly as may be in accordance with the provisions of the Act hereinabove last mentioned.
