    levy rate =_(((A × W1) + (B × W2)) × C)_ 
    
    D 
    
    where---
    
    **A**
    > 
    > is the estimated current player expenditure in a sector divided by the total estimated current player expenditure in all sectors subject to the levy
    
    **B**
    > 
    > is the customer presentations to problem gambling services that can be attributed to gambling in a sector divided by total customer presentations to problem gambling services in which a sector that is subject to the levy can be identified
    
    **C**
    > 
    > is the funding requirement for the period for which the levy is payable
    
    **D**
    > 
    > is the forecast player expenditure in a sector for the period during which the levy is payable
    
    **W1 and W2**
    > 
    > are weights, the sum of which is 1\.
    
    (3) In calculating the levy rate under subsection (2),---
        
    *   (a) _player expenditure_, in amount A,---
            
        *   (i) for the New Zealand Racing Board, has the same meaning as betting profits in [section 4(2) and (3)][562] of the Gaming Duties Act 1971; and
        
        *   (ii) for a gaming machine operator (including the New Zealand Racing Board), has the same meaning as gaming machine profits in [section 12B][563] of the Gaming Duties Act 1971; and

        *   (iv) for the Lotteries Commission, means turnover less prizes paid and payable:
        
        
    
    *   (b) the proposed amounts of A and B, and the periods to which they apply, must take into account the latest, most reliable, and most appropriate sources of information from---

        *   (ii) the department responsible for the integrated problem gambling strategy on customer presentations to problem gambling services:

        *   (ii) in the case of the initial levy period, the estimated costs of the department that has responsibility for the integrated problem gambling strategy during the transition to the strategy in the period before the introduction of the initial levy; and
        
        *   (iii) any under-recovery or over-recovery of levy in the previous period:
        
        
    
    *   (d) the proposed amount of D must take into account---
            
        *   (i) the latest, most reliable, and most appropriate sources of information on past expenditure available from the Inland Revenue Department; and
        
        *   (ii) advice from the Secretary on an appropriate forecasting method:
        
        
    
    *   (e) the values of W1 and W2 must be specified in the regulations.
