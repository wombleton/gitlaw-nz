An Act to authorise the Greymouth Harbour Board to sell certain land

##### 1 Short Title
    
*   This Act may be cited as the Greymouth Harbour Board Empowering Act 1982\.

##### 2 Interpretation
    
*   In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, _Board_ means the Greymouth Harbour Board incorporated under the Greymouth Harbour Board Act 1884\.

##### 3 Land may be sold to lessees
    
*   (1) The Board is hereby empowered to sell and transfer the fee simple of the land comprised in the lease of any of the land described in the [Schedule][6] to the lessees thereof at the current unimproved value at the time of the sale, as determined by a registered valuer, together with the value, as so determined, of any improvements on the land effected or owned by the Board and not previously purchased by the lessee or any previous lessee.
    
    (1A) Any sale under subsection (1) shall be on such terms and conditions as are determined by the Board, and the Board may sell the land---
        
    *   (a) for cash; or
    
    *   (b) by allowing such part of the purchase price as it thinks fit to remain owing to the Board and be secured by a registerable mortgage of the land sold; or
    
    *   (c) by entering into an agreement for sale and purchase with the purchaser which provides for the purchaser to enter into possession and to pay the purchase price by instalments before the land is transferred to the purchaser.
    
    (1B) The interest payable on any unpaid purchase money shall be at such rate as may be fixed by the Board at the time of sale and, if so provided for in any mortgage or agreement for sale and purchase, as may be fixed from time to time by the Board in accordance with any such provision.
    
    (2) Whether or not such sale is completed by the lessee, the cost of the said valuation and the Board's legal expenses in respect of such proposed sale shall be borne by the lessee.
    
    (3) On the completion of any such sale and transfer the land affected thereby shall be freed from all trusts theretofore affecting it.
    
    (4) In this section the terms _unimproved value_ and _improvements_ shall have the same meanings as they had in the Valuation of Land Act 1951 immediately before the commencement of the Valuation of Land Amendment Act (No 2) 1970\.
    
    (5) In assessing the unimproved value of any land for the purposes of this Act, the assessment shall be made as if the land was not leased.
    
    (6) Nothing in this section shall in any way affect the rights of lessees under leases of the said land in existence immediately before the passing of this Act.
    
    Section 3(1): substituted, on 25 June 1986, by section 2 of the Greymouth Harbour Board Empowering Amendment Act 1986 (1986 No 2 (L)).
    
    Section 3(1): amended, on 1 July 1998, by [section 54(1)][7] of the Rating Valuations Act 1998 (1998 No 69). 
    
    Section 3(1A): inserted, on 25 June 1986, by section 2 of the Greymouth Harbour Board Empowering Amendment Act 1986 (1986 No 2 (L)).
    
    Section 3(1B): inserted, on 25 June 1986, by section 2 of the Greymouth Harbour Board Empowering Amendment Act 1986 (1986 No 2 (L)).

##### 4 Application of purchase money
    
*   (1) Where the fee simple of land is sold to the lessee under [section 3][4], the purchase money, and money received as interest on unpaid purchase money, shall be paid by the Board to a special account within the Harbour Fund of the Board; and that money (or any part of it), whether received in respect of sales made before or after the commencement of this subsection, shall be applied from time to time by the Board---
        
    *   (a) first, to offset the Board's fixed current account advance at the Bank of New Zealand, Greymouth, or to meet the costs of servicing any term loan that may be obtained by the Board to replace that fixed current account advance; and
    
    *   (b) secondly, in respect of the balance of that money (if any), in the purchase of land and any improvements thereon, such land to be acquired in the name of the Board as an endowment to replace the endowment so sold, or in improving or developing land so purchased or held by the Board as an existing endowment.
    
    (2) Pending the application of such money in accordance with subsection (1), the Board may invest the money pursuant to section 48 of the Harbours Act 1950\.
    
    Section 4(1): substituted, on 25 June 1986, by section 3 of the Greymouth Harbour Board Empowering Amendment Act 1986 (1986 No 2 (L)).

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Greymouth Harbour Board Empowering Act 1982\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 July 1998, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][9] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][10] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][11] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][12] and [17E][13] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
