    provided that in any case where the deduction of input tax referred to in that proviso has been made by any other person (where that supplier and that other person are associated persons), the consideration in money for that supply shall be deemed to be an amount equal to the purchase price of those goods to that other person:

    (5A) In subsection (5),---
    
    _cash price_ has the same meaning as in [section 5][320] of the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act 2003

        *   (ii) shall not apply where that payment is in respect of the supply of goods and services to the registered person or the importation of any goods by that registered person; and

        *   (vi) does not apply to the supply of a contract of insurance when the supplier is not required to account for output tax on the supply; and

    *   (f) any amount of input tax in relation to any supply in respect of which paragraph (a) of, or the proviso to, subsection (2) has operated to deny a deduction of input tax, and that registered person has obtained, during the taxable period, a tax invoice in relation to that supply:
    
    *   (g) any amount calculated in accordance with [section 20A][44] in relation to any goods and services so supplied during that taxable period; and

    provided that a registered person who is entitled to deduct an amount from the output tax attributable to a taxable period may deduct that amount from the output tax attributable to a later taxable period if the amount has not previously been deducted from the output tax of the registered person and---
        
    *   (a) the later tax period begins on or before the date that is the second anniversary of the earlier of the following:
            
        *   (i) the date on which the registered person makes the payment for the taxable supply to which the deduction relates:
        
        *   (ii) the date on which a tax invoice is issued for the taxable supply to which the deduction relates:
        
        
    
    *   (b) the failure of the registered person to make the deduction in the earlier taxable period arises from---
            
        *   (i) an inability of the registered person to obtain a tax invoice:
        
        *   (ii) a dispute over the proper amount of the payment for the taxable supply to which the deduction relates:

        *   (iv) a clear mistake or simple oversight of the registered person.

    (3AB) \[Repealed\]
    
    (3B) \[Repealed\]
    
    (3C) For the purposes of subsection (3), and if subsection (3D) does not apply,---
        
    *   (a) input tax as defined in [section 3A(1)(a) or (c)][7] may be deducted to the extent to which the goods or services are used for, or are available for use in, making taxable supplies:
    
    *   (b) input tax as defined in [section 3A(1)(b)][7] may be deducted to the extent to which the goods are used for, or are available for use in, making taxable supplies other than---
            
        *   (i) the delivery of the goods to a person in New Zealand:
        
        *   (ii) arranging or making easier the delivery of the goods to a person in New Zealand.
        
        
    
    (3D) A registered person is not required to apportion input tax in an adjustment period if they make both taxable and exempt supplies and have reasonable grounds to believe that the total value of their exempt supplies will not be more than the lesser of---
        
    *   (a) $90,000:
    
    *   (b) 5% of the total consideration for all their taxable and exempt supplies for the adjustment period.
    
    (3E) A registered person who principally makes supplies of financial services may choose to use a fair and reasonable method of apportionment, as agreed with the Commissioner, in relation to the supply for an apportionment on acquisition. For this purpose,---
        
    *   (a) the method must have regard to the tenor of subsections (3C) to (3J):
    
    *   (b) the person may include a group of companies.
    
    (3F) The method used to calculate the amount that may be deducted on acquisition is set out in subsections (3C) to (3J). The rules for calculating adjustments are set out in [sections 21 to 21H][51].
    
    (3G) In determining the extent to which goods or services are used for making taxable supplies, a person must estimate at the time of acquisition how they intend to use the goods or services, choosing a determination method that provides a fair and reasonable result. The determination is expressed as a percentage of the total use.
    
    (3H) The extent to which a deduction for input tax is allowed is calculated using the formula---
    
    full input tax deduction × percentage intended use
    
    (3I) In the formula in subsection (3H),---
        
    *   (a) _full input tax deduction_ is the total amount of input tax on the supply:
    
    *   (b) _percentage intended use_ has the meaning set out in [section 21G(1)(b)][59].
    
    (3J) For a supply to which [section 11(1)(mb)][18] applies, the recipient must,---
        
    *   (a) on acquisition,---
            
        *   (i) identify the nominal amount of tax (the **nominal GST component**) that would be chargeable on the value of the supply, as if the value were equal to the consideration charged for the supply, at the rate set out in [section 8(1)][14]; and
        
        *   (ii) determine the extent to which they intend to use the goods or services as described in subsection (3G); and
        
        *   (iii) account for output tax under [section 20(4)][43] for the proportion of the nominal GST component for any non-taxable use of the goods or services; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) for later adjustment periods, make adjustments under the apportionment rules set out in [sections 20G][50] and [21 to 21H][51] in relation to the taxable supply referred to in paragraph (a).
    
    (3JB) For a supply to which [section 20G][50] applies, the recipient must,---
        
    *   (a) on acquisition,---
            
        *   (i) identify the nominal amount of tax that would be chargeable on the value of the supply, as if the value were equal to the consideration charged for the supply, at the rate set out in [section 8(1)][14]:
        
        *   (ii) determine the extent to which they intend to use the goods, as described in subsection (3G); and
        
        *   (iii) account for input tax for the amount calculated under subsections (3G) and (3H); and
        
        
    
    *   (b) make adjustments under [section 20G(4) and (5)][50] in relation to the taxable supply referred to in paragraph (a).
    
    (3K) For the purposes of subsections (3) and (3C), to the extent to which a non-profit body uses goods or services other than for making exempt supplies, the goods or services are treated as being used for making taxable supplies.
    
    (4) For the purpose of subsection (3), output tax in relation to a supply made by a registered person must be attributed to a taxable period---
        
    *   (a) in the case of a registered person who is required to account for tax payable on an invoice or a hybrid basis under [section 19][37], if the supply is made or is deemed to be made during the taxable period; or
    
    *   (b) in the case of a registered person who is required to account for tax payable on a payments basis under [section 19][37]---
            
        *   (i) to the extent that payment for the supply has been received during the taxable period, if the supply is a supply of goods and services which is deemed to take place under any one of [sections 9(1)][16], 9(3)(a), 9(3)(aa), 9(6), 9(8), [25(2)(a)][69], 25(4) and is not treated by [section 8(4B)][14] as being made in New Zealand; or
        
        *   (ib) to the extent that payment for the supply has been made during the taxable period, if the supply is a supply of services that is treated as being made in New Zealand by [section 8(4B)][14] together with any one of [sections 9(1)][16], 9(3)(a), 9(3)(aa), 9(6), 9(8), [25AA(2)(a)][70] or 25AA(3)(a); or
        
        *   (ii) if the supply of goods and services is made during the taxable period by the registered person and neither of subparagraphs (i) and (ib) applies; or
        
        
    
    *   (c) in the case of a registered person who is required to account for tax payable under [section 21D(1)][56] and (3)(b), for the relevant adjustment period.
    
    (4B) A person who is treated under [section 5(23)][9] as a supplier of goods under [section 11(1)(mb)][18] is denied a deduction under subsection (3) in relation to the supply. However, this subsection does not apply to a person required to account for tax under section 5(23) who later becomes a registered person under [section 51][105] and uses the relevant goods for making taxable supplies.
    
    (5) If, in relation to any taxable period and any registered person, the total amount that may be deducted under subsection (3) exceeds the aggregate amount of the output tax of that registered person attributable to that taxable period, the amount of the excess shall, subject to this Act, be refunded to that registered person by the Commissioner pursuant to [section 46][98].

    total income-earning days + total private days.
    
    (2) In the formula,---

        *   (ii) related solely to the private use of the asset, as that term is defined in section DG 4 of that Act:
        
        
    
    *   (b) **total income-earning days** is the total number of days in the period on which the person supplies the asset for use and derives consideration for the supply, whether at, above, or below market value as that term is defined in section DG 3(5) of that Act, including any days on which---

        *   (iii) a fringe benefit tax liability arises:
        
        
    
    *   (c) **total private days** is the total number of days in the period on which the asset is in active use as described in section DG 3(7) of that Act and the day is not an income-earning day as described in paragraph (b).
    
    (3) A unit of measurement of time other than days, whether relating to hours, or nights, or anything else is to be used in the formula and in subsection (2)(b) and (c), if the use of the unit provides a fair and reasonable result. For this purpose, the same unit must be used in relation to both total income-earning days and total private days.
    
    (4) The person must ascertain at the end of an adjustment period whether an adjustment is required to be made for any percentage difference in a supply of the asset for the period in relation to the actual use of the asset for making taxable supplies.

    *   (a) identify the percentage actual use of the asset in accordance with the formula in subsection (1) for making taxable supplies; and
    
    *   (b) compare the percentage actual use with percentage intended use as described in [section 20(3JB)][43] or previous actual use, as applicable; and
    
    *   (c) if a percentage difference arises, make an adjustment for any percentage difference for the adjustment period, applying [section 21D(3)][56] to the resulting amount.
    
    (6) For the purposes of subsection (5), all expenditure incurred in relation to the use of the asset is aggregated and included in the relevant adjustment unless [section 21(2)(c) or (d)][51] applies to the aggregated amount.
    
    (7) [Sections 8][14] and [21F][58] apply to the disposal of the asset, treating the disposal as in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity.
    
    (8) For the purposes of this section, a registered person does not include a widely-held company, as that term is defined in [section YA 1][171] of the Income Tax Act 2007\.

    (4) For an adjustment to which [sections 21A to 21H][52] apply, a registered person who principally makes supplies of financial services may choose to use a fair and reasonable method, as agreed with the Commissioner, for making adjustments in subsequent adjustment periods.

    *   (b) at the commencement of any month where there are reasonable grounds for believing that the total value of the supplies to be made in New Zealand in that month and the 11 months immediately following that month will exceed the amount specified in paragraph (a):

    (4) If a local authority changes their accounting basis before 1 July 2013, the amount of the tax payable must be calculated on the day before the date on which the change is to take effect, although the amount remains available to be paid as described in subsection (3).
    
    (5) No late payment penalty, shortfall penalty, or interest under [Part 7][189] of the Tax Administration Act 1994 arises for the local authority as a result of its application of the spreading provision in subsection (3), whether or not the authority incurs a tax liability because it changes its accounting basis before 1 July 2013\.
