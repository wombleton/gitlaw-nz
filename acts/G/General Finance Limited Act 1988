    (3) The charge created by each [Part 1][16] subsidiary company by virtue of the debenture trust deed is hereby deemed to be satisfied in respect of that subsidiary company upon the vesting of the undertaking of that subsidiary company in the Company, and the undertaking as so vested is hereby deemed to be subject to the charge created by the Company by virtue of that deed together with the assets of the Company as also charged under that deed.

##### 8 Documents, etc, to remain evidence
    
*   (1) Any document, matter, or thing, which if this Act had not been passed would have been admissible in evidence in respect of any matter for or against any subsidiary company shall, from the appointed time, be admissible in evidence in respect of the same matter for or against the Company.

    (2) The presentation to any registrar or other person of any instrument, whether or not comprising an instrument of transfer by the Company,---
        
    *   (a) executed or purporting to be executed by the Company; and
    
    *   (b) relating to any property held by a subsidiary company immediately before the appointed time; and
    
    *   (c) containing a recital that that property has become vested in the Company by virtue of this Act---
    
    shall, in the absence of proof to the contrary, be sufficient evidence that the property is vested in the Company.
    
    (3) Except as provided in this section, nothing in this Act shall derogate from the provisions of the [Land Transfer Act 1952][19].

##### 10 Taxes and duties

##### 11 Dissolution of subsidiary companies
    
*   (1) The subsidiary companies are hereby deemed to be dissolved with effect from the appointed time with the same effects in all respects as if the subsidiary companies had been wound up in accordance with the Companies Act 1955 pursuant to a resolution for voluntary winding up; and as if the requirements of the Companies Act 1955 relating to such winding up and dissolution of the subsidiary companies had been complied with.
    
    (2) Notwithstanding the dissolution of the subsidiary companies by subsection (1), for the purposes of the [Securities Regulations 1983][21] the [Part 1][16] subsidiary companies shall be deemed to remain part of the group (within the meaning of that term in those regulations) of which the Company is the issuer.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the General Finance Limited Act 1988\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 April 1995, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][22] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][23] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][24] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][25] and [17E][26] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
