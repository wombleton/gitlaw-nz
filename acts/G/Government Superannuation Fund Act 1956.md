In every such case,---
        
    *   (a) from the expiration of 6 months commencing on the date of receipt of the election, the contributor shall be deemed to have contributed at his standard rate during the period to which the election relates; and

    provided that where by reason of age or infirmity the contributor's salary has been reduced (whether by reason of his transfer or appointment to another position or otherwise), his retiring allowance shall be computed on the average rate of salary on the basis of which he contributed to the Fund during the 5 years immediately preceding that reduction or transfer, or the 5 years immediately preceding his retirement, whichever of those average rates is the higher:
    
    provided further that, where the contributor was a contributor to the Government Railways Superannuation Fund at any time before 1 April 1948, his retiring allowance shall be computed on his annual rate of pay within the meaning of Part 3 of the Government Railways Act 1926, if computation under this proviso would increase the annual amount of the retiring allowance payable under paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of [section 35][91] to an amount not exceeding $300\.

    (3) Where a contributor is employed otherwise than on a full-time basis, his annual salary for the purpose of computing the retiring allowance to be granted to him shall be deemed to be such an amount as the Authority may determine in each case:
    
    provided that the contributions payable by the contributor under [section 29][84] shall be calculated with reference to his actual salary as received from time to time.

    (5) No retiring allowance shall be granted in accordance with this section of an amount that is calculated to impose any additional liability on the Fund, and every such retiring allowance shall, in accordance with regulations in that behalf, be computed as the actuarial equivalent of the retiring allowance to which the contributor would have been entitled if he had not made an election under this section.
    
    (6) Every election under this section shall be in writing delivered to the Authority.

##### 52A University contributors entering approved external employment
    
*   (1) In this section the term _approved external employment_ means employment by a university of a country within the Commonwealth (other than New Zealand), or employment by an organisation constituted in a country within the Commonwealth (other than New Zealand), being an organisation engaged in research or education services and approved by the controlling authority; and includes such period or periods of travelling time as the controlling authority may approve.
    
    (2) Where any contributor who is in the education service under any university or university college of agriculture, and who has been a contributor for a period of not less than 5 years, retires from that service and enters approved external employment, he may, with the approval of the controlling authority, elect in writing---
        
    *   (a) to continue to contribute to the Fund on the basis set out in subsection (5) after his retirement for a period not exceeding 5 years so long as he remains in approved external employment:
    
    *   (b) to postpone, for such period or periods while he remains in approved external employment as the controlling authority approves, the acceptance by him of a refund of the contributions made by him to the Fund.
    
    (3) Except with the approval of the Authority,---
        
    *   (a) every initial election under subsection (2) in respect of any period shall be delivered to the Authority before the retirement of the contributor; and
    
    *   (b) every subsequent election under subsection (2) which is made by a contributor who has continued to contribute to the Fund in respect of any period of approved external employment shall be delivered to the Authority before the contributor ceases to contribute to the Fund.
    
    (4) The period during which any person continues to contribute to the Fund under this section shall be deemed for the purpose of this Act to be contributory service; and he shall be deemed to receive during that period the salary on the basis of which he was contributing immediately before his retirement.
    
    (5) In respect of his contributory service during the last-mentioned period, every contributor shall pay into the Fund within such time and in such manner as the Authority may allow in that behalf---
        
    *   (a) the contributions payable by him under this Act; and
    
    *   (b) the amount by which those contributions are less than the amount certified by the Authority, after receiving advice from an actuary, as the total amount of contributions that would require to be so paid if the contributions provided the total cost of the benefits to which the contributor may become entitled under this Act.
    
    (6) Except with the consent of the Authority, no part of the amount paid by the contributor under paragraph (b) of subsection (5) shall be deemed to form part of his contributions to the Fund.
    
    (7) Where any contributor re-enters the education service immediately following the termination of any period of approved external employment,---
        
    *   (a) if he continued to contribute to the Fund during that period, he may continue to contribute to the Fund upon his re-entry into the education service:
    
    *   (b) if an election by him to postpone the acceptance of a refund of the contributions made by him to the Fund continued until the end of that period, that election shall be deemed to extend for a further period of 5 years after the date of his re-entry into the education service:
        
        provided that the contributor may, with the approval of the controlling authority, at any time during that further period, elect in writing to resume contributing to the Fund as from the date of the election or some subsequent date within that further period.
    
    (8) Any period of postponement approved by the controlling authority under subsection (2), and any extension of that period under subsection (7), may be at any time terminated by the contributor by notice in writing addressed to the Authority, and shall terminate in any case where the contributor ceases to be in approved external employment or in the education service. Every such period, and every extension of any such period, during which the contributor is not actually contributing to the Fund, is hereafter in this section referred to as a _period of postponement_.
    
    (9) An election may be made under this section after any second or subsequent retirement from, or re-entry to, the education service, whether or not the period to which the elections relate in the aggregate exceeds 5 years.
    
    (10) If on the termination of any period of postponement the contributor, before he has accepted a retiring allowance or a refund of his contributions, recommences to contribute to the Fund, the period of his contributory service before the commencement of that period of postponement shall be deemed, for the purpose of determining his percentage rate of contribution for the second or subsequent period under [section 29][84], immediately to precede the period of his contributory service after that recommencement and to form part thereof.
    
    (11) The contributor shall be deemed to continue to be a contributor to the Fund during any period of postponement:
    
    provided that no contributions shall be payable by the contributor to the Fund, and no payments shall be made to the contributor for his own benefit out of the Fund in respect of any period of postponement or any part thereof, and no part of any such period shall be regarded as part of the period of his contributory service:
    
    provided also that the provisions of [section 36][92] shall not apply during any period of postponement.
    
    (12) Any contributor to whom [section 35][91] becomes applicable during any period of postponement, or while he is contributing to the Fund under paragraph (a) of subsection (2), shall be entitled to receive from the Fund an annual retiring allowance computed in terms of that section as if he had retired from the Government service on the first date when that section became applicable to him; and he shall not be entitled to continue to contribute to the Fund after that date.
    
    (13) Where any contributor dies during a period of postponement or while the contributor is contributing to the Fund under paragraph (a) of subsection (2), the provisions of [sections 45][101] and [47][103] shall apply as if the contributor would have become entitled to a retiring allowance if he had retired on the date of his death on the ground of being medically unfit for further duty.
    
    (14) Where any contributor retires, for whatever reason, from approved external employment before [section 35][91] becomes applicable to him, whether or not he is contributing to the Fund under paragraph (a) of subsection (2), if he does not immediately re-enter the education service, [section 42][98] shall apply as if he had retired from the Government service, and the provisions of [section 36][92] shall not apply in any such case.

    (4) The Governor-General may from time to time, by Order in Council,---
        
    *   (a) approve for the purposes of this section any scheme established to provide superannuation for employees of a university of a country within the Commonwealth (other than New Zealand), or of an organisation constituted in a country within the Commonwealth (other than New Zealand) being an organisation engaged in research or educational service:

    *   (a) the contributor's final average earnings shall be determined under [section 61L][145] as if the date on which the contributor ceased Government service was the date of the contributor's retirement:

    provided that, if the Authority in any such case so directs, the retiring allowance shall be computed as if the contributor had retired at such date as the Authority may specify, being earlier than the date of his actual retirement but not earlier than the date on which he completed 20 years of contributory service, and in any such case the contributor shall be entitled to receive from the Fund a refund without interest of his contributions to the Fund in respect of his contributory service after the date so specified:
    
    provided also that the Authority, in its discretion, may defer the commencement of payment of any retiring allowance payable under this subsection until such date as the Authority may specify, being not later than the earliest date at which the contributor could have been compulsorily retired from the regular forces by reason of the expiration of the period of his engagement or by reason of his attaining the appropriate age for retirement:

##### 70 Contributors entering Government service after retirement from regular forces
    
*   (1) Where any permanent member or regular serviceman retires from the regular forces, and within 6 months thereafter becomes employed in the Government service otherwise than in the regular forces, the following provisions shall apply:
        
    *   (a) he may elect to become a contributor under [Part 2][68], in which case his contributory service before his retirement from the regular forces shall be deemed to be continuous with his employment in the Government service thereafter, and his right (if any) to receive a retiring allowance under [section 68][167] shall cease:
    
    *   (b) if he is entitled to receive a retiring allowance under [section 68][167], he may elect to continue as a contributor to the Fund and to reserve his right to that retiring allowance, in which case he shall be entitled on his retirement from the Government service to receive that retiring allowance from the date of that retirement, computed by reference to the portion of his contributory service before his retirement from the regular forces, and also, if he is entitled to a retiring allowance under [Part 2][68], to receive that retiring allowance computed by reference to the portion of his contributory service subsequent to his retirement from the regular forces, or if he is not entitled to or elects not to receive such a retiring allowance, to receive a refund, without interest, of the amount of his contributions to the Fund in respect of that subsequent portion of his contributory service:
    
    *   (c) he may elect to receive a refund, without interest, of his contributions to the Fund, in which case he may become a contributor to the Fund in respect of his employment in the Government service but, subject to the provisions of subsection (3), not in respect of any period before his retirement from the regular forces:
    
    *   (d) if he is entitled to a retiring allowance under [section 68][167], he may elect to receive that retiring allowance.
    
    (2) Every election under this section shall be made within 6 months after the retirement of the contributor from the regular forces.
    
    (3) Subject to such conditions as the Authority may impose, whether as to money to be repaid to the Fund or otherwise, an election may be made under this section notwithstanding that the contributor may have previously received a refund of his contributions or may have previously commenced to receive a retiring allowance.
    
    (4) Where there is an interval between the retirement of the contributor from the regular forces and the commencement of his subsequent employment in the Government service, he may, with the consent of the Authority but not otherwise, contribute to the Fund in respect of that interval.
    
    (5) Where any permanent member or regular serviceman who has retired from the regular forces on a retiring allowance under [section 68][167] or [section 69][168], and whose length of contributory service is less than 40 years, is re-employed as a regular serviceman, he shall again be a contributor to the Fund from the date of his re-employment at such rate of contribution as the Authority determines. In any such case the retiring allowance shall not be payable while he continues to be a contributor; and upon his subsequently ceasing to be a contributor his retiring allowance shall be computed separately in respect of each of his periods of service and of the rate of salary on the basis of which he contributed to the Fund during each of those periods:
    
    provided that where his retirement was on the ground of being medically unfit for further duty he may with the consent of the Authority elect to have his retiring allowance computed in respect of the total length of his periods of contributory service as if they were continuous.

    (2) Where the salary of a contributing member is completely stopped as aforesaid for a period of less than 28 days, or is partly stopped for any period, his contributions to the Fund shall be payable in respect of that period as if his salary had not been stopped, and that period shall be counted in computing the length of his contributory service.

    (2) For the purposes of this section, the term _basic retiring allowance_ means the annual amount of the retiring allowance payable under this Act after taking into account any surrender under [section 48][104] or [section 91][359], but disregarding the effect of any election made under [section 40][96].
    
    (3) The allowance that is to be paid to any assignee under this section shall be determined by the Authority on an actuarial basis so that there is no overall increase or decrease in the liabilities of the Fund.
    
    (4) Any election under subsection (1) shall not affect the application of the [Government Superannuation Fund Amendment Act 1969][700] and the [Government Superannuation Fund Amendment Act 1979][701], and where the contributor's basic retiring allowance is increased under those Acts the allowance payable to the assignee shall be increased proportionately.

    (6) Where any assignee dies, the allowance payable to the assignee under this section shall cease; and the portion of the retiring allowance payable to the person who surrendered a portion of a retiring allowance to enable the allowance to be paid shall not be increased by reason of the death of the assignee.
    
    (7) Where a person who has surrendered a portion of a basic retiring allowance under this section dies,---
        
    *   (a) any annuity payable in respect of the basic retiring allowance shall be calculated on that portion of the basic retiring allowance that has not been surrendered under this section; and
    
    *   (b) the allowance payable to the assignee under this section shall continue until the death of the assignee and shall be increased in accordance with subsection (4) as if the contributor's basic retiring allowance remained payable.
    
    (8) The minimum annuities referred to in [sections 45][101], [74J][212], and [81K][252] shall be reduced by the proportion that the basic retiring allowance on which they are based has been surrendered under subsection (1).
    
    (9) Nothing in this section shall in any way restrict or prevent the suspension, reduction, or cancellation in accordance with this Act of the payment of any retiring allowance; and any suspension, reduction, or cancellation shall be applied equally to the retiring allowance and the payments under this section to the assignee.
    
    (10) Nothing in this section shall in any way affect or apply to the payment of any allowance to a child under [section 47][103] or [section 61Q][150] or [section 81O][256].

    provided that where the contributory service of a member commenced before he attained the age of 25 years, every complete year of service in the Police or the prisons service shall, if necessary, be deemed to be increased by such proportion of a year, being less than one-seventh, as would entitle the member, having regard to his age at the commencement of his contributory service, to 40 years contributory service at the age of 60 years if his contributory service had all been in the Police or the prisons service:
    
    provided also that every fraction of a year of contributory service in the Police or the prisons service shall, for the purpose of computing the length of contributory service, be deemed to be increased proportionately in accordance with this subsection.
    
    (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1), any member of the Police or of the prisons service shall not on retirement be deemed to have completed more than 40 years of contributory service during the period before the commencement of this Part unless his actual period of contributory service during that period is longer than 40 years.
    
    (3) Where a period of contributory service is partly in the Police or the prisons service and partly outside those branches of the Government service, only the period served in those branches of the Government service shall be computed in accordance with subsection (1).
    
    (4) Nothing in this section shall apply to the computation of any period of contributory service unless the contributor is a member of the Police or the prisons service at the date of his death or retirement.

In any such case any period of service in the Police or the prisons service shall be computed as if that service were ordinary contributory service in the branch to which the contributor transfers and he shall be entitled to a refund of an amount equal to the difference between his actual contributions and the contributions he would have paid if he had been employed in that branch during his service in the Police or the prisons service.
    
    (2) Where a contributor transfers from another branch of the Government service to the Police or the prisons service, the rate of contribution payable by him in respect of his service in the Police or the prisons service shall be the appropriate rate payable under this Part, having regard to his age at the date of the commencement of his contributory service.
