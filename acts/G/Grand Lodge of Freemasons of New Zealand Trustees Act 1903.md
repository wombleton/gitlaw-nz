##### 5 Powers of trustees
    
*   So far as persons dealing with such trustees are concerned, such trustees, both of Grand Lodge and Craft Lodges, shall be deemed to have the same power of sale, lease, mortgage, and disposition over such property as if they were the absolute owners thereof; and it shall not be incumbent upon any person to inquire whether any proposed dealing constitutes a breach of trust, nor shall any person be concerned to see to the application of any purchase, mortgage, or other moneys paid to such trustees.

##### 7 Documents concerning personal estate executed by majority sufficient
    
*   The signatures of the majority of the trustees for the time being in whom are vested any lands mortgaged to such trustees, or in whose names are invested any moneys in any bank or company, to any release or transfer shall be sufficient to reconvey, release, or transfer respectively the estate of all the trustees therein in the same manner as if such documents had been signed by the whole of such trustees.

##### 8 Register of trustees to be kept
    
*   The authorised representative for the time being of the Grand Lodge shall keep or cause to be kept, in duplicate, a Register of Trustees of the several lands and funds for the time being held subject to the provisions of this Act on behalf of Grand Lodge and the respective Craft Lodges in New Zealand, and such register shall be called and inscribed as ""The Grand Lodge of Freemasons' Register of Trustees for New Zealand,"" and shall be in the form or to the effect contained in the Schedule hereto; and such authorised representative shall with all reasonable despatch enter or cause to be entered in such Register of Trustees the names and additions of the present trustees of such lands and funds respectively, with all other particulars indicated in the said Schedule; and such authorised representative shall from time to time, upon the appointment of any new trustee or trustees under the constitution and laws of Grand Lodge or by-laws of Craft Lodges respectively, insert or cause to be inserted in such Register of Trustees the name and addition of any new trustee or trustees, and how the vacancy in the trust occurred, whether by death or otherwise, and the date of the appointment of the new trustee or trustees, and also of the date of insertion of his or their name or names in such Register of Trustees; and such authorised representative shall sign his name in such Register of Trustees in the proper column, in the same line with the name of every trustee (old and new), to authenticate the due appointment of each trustee.

##### 10 Interest of trustees in personalty to pass to new trustees without transfer
    
*   On the insertion as aforesaid in the said Register of Trustees of the name or names of any new trustee or trustees of any personal property, moneys, or securities for money held subject to the provisions of this Act, the estate in such property, money, or securities of the trustee or trustees in whose place such new trustee or new trustees shall be appointed shall forthwith vest in such new trustee or trustees, solely or jointly as the case may be with the old continuing trustee or trustees (if any), for the same estate or interest as the former trustee or trustees had therein, and subject to the same trusts, without any transfer or assignment whatsoever.
