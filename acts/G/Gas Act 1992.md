    *   (b) the health and safety of any person who is, or class of persons who are, likely to be directly affected by the work on the road:
    
    *   (c) the need to lessen the damage that is likely to be caused to property (including structural integrity of the roads) as a result of work on the road:

##### 43H Low fixed charge tariff option for domestic consumers
    
*   (1) The objective of this section is to enable the making of regulations to ensure that gas providers offer a low fixed charge tariff option or options for delivered gas to domestic consumers that will assist low-use consumers and encourage energy conservation.
    
    (2) In this section,---
    
    _delivered gas_ includes components like gas supply, line function services, customer service, meter provision, and meter reading services
    
    _fixed charge_ means a charge levied for each customer connection in currency per time period (for example, cents per day)
    
    _gas provider_ means a gas retailer or other business that contracts with consumers to sell delivered gas or a component of delivered gas.
    
    (3) The Governor-General may, by Order in Council made on the recommendation of the Minister in accordance with [sections 43I to 43P][71], make regulations for all or any of the following purposes:
        
    *   (a) requiring gas providers to make available to domestic consumers 1 or more tariff options that include a fixed charge for delivered gas to dwellinghouses at not more than a specified amount:
    
    *   (b) regulating the variable (cents per kilowatt hour) charges in those required tariff options to ensure that low-use domestic consumers would pay a lower total charge on the required tariff option than on any similar alternative tariff option available from that gas provider:
    
    *   (c) regulating other charges and other terms and conditions of the contracts to which the low fixed charge tariff options in paragraph (a) relate, to ensure that they are not, in the opinion of the Minister, unreasonably detrimental to the interests of low-use consumers:

    (4) No gas provider that is a customer trust or a community trust may pay a domestic consumer who is on the required tariff option a different rebate only because the consumer is on the required tariff option.
    
    (5) Each trustee of a gas provider that contravenes subsection (4) commits an offence, and is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding $20,000\.
    
    (6) If the components that make up the delivered gas are unbundled, regulations may be made under subsection (3) for each component, or group of components, of delivered gas to ensure that the objective of this section is achieved for the aggregate of all the components.
    
    (7) Subsection (6) applies regardless of whether different components of delivered gas are supplied by the same gas provider.
    
    (8) Regulations made under subsection (3) may provide for the way in which the total charge of the low-use domestic consumer is to be assessed, which may be (without limitation) calculated with reference to national data or the data relating to any gas retailer or gas distributor.
    
    (9) The Governor-General may, for the purpose of assisting retailers to deliver low fixed charge tariff options, by Order in Council made on the recommendation of the Minister in accordance with [sections 43I to 43P][71], make regulations for all or any of the following purposes:
        
    *   (a) regulating all or any charges charged by gas distributors to ensure that they are not, in the opinion of the Minister, unreasonably detrimental to the interests of low-use consumers:
    
    *   (b) regulating the terms and conditions under which gas distributors supply their services in relation to domestic consumers to ensure that they are not, in the opinion of the Minister, unreasonably detrimental to the interests of low-use consumers:
    
    *   (c) setting rules as to the offering, availability, supply, and unbundling of gas distributors' services:
    
    *   (d) regulating the charging, offering, supply, and availability of delivered gas by other gas providers.

    *   (a) the importance of the rule, including whether the rule has a material effect on the rights and interests of individuals:
    
    *   (b) the subject matter of the rule, including whether the rule contains detailed or technical matters rather than matters of general principle:
    
    *   (c) the application of the rule, including---

    *   (d) the expertise and rule-making procedures of the recommending body.
    
    (3) If the Minister makes, or the recommending body recommends, a rule for a purpose for which a gas governance regulation may be made, [sections 43I to 43P][71] apply (with necessary modifications) as if the rule were a gas governance regulation.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Gas Act 1992\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 24 May 2013, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][350] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][351] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][352] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][353] and [17E][354] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
