An Act to vary certain trusts declared by Lady Annie May McKenzie, the wife of Sir John Robert McKenzie, of Christchurch, Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, and the said Sir John Robert McKenzie
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    Whereas by a certain deed of settlement dated 15 November 1933 (hereinafter called _the first settlement_), executed by the above-named Annie May McKenzie, as settlor, certain land and hereditaments were conveyed to Trustees to be held by them upon certain trusts for the benefit of the 2 sons of the settlor---namely, Donald Hugh McKenzie and Roy Allan McKenzie---and certain further trusts were declared to have effect in the event of neither of such sons living to attain a vested interest in the Trust Fund: 
    
    And whereas by a further deed of settlement dated 12 February 1940 (hereinafter called _the second settlement_), executed by the said John Robert McKenzie, as settlor, certain shares were conveyed and transferred to Trustees to be held by them upon certain further trusts for the 2 sons of the settlor namely, the said Donald Hugh McKenzie and the said Roy Allan McKenzie and the child or children of each of them respectively---and certain substitutionary trusts of a charitable nature were directed to have effect on failure of the said trusts: 
    
    And whereas by a series of trust instruments certain of the trusts declared in and by the first settlement and the second settlement were revoked and cancelled and certain other trusts were declared in lieu thereof: 
    
    And whereas the said Donald Hugh McKenzie died on or about 21 January 1942 whilst a member of the Royal New Zealand Air Force: 
    
    And whereas by deed of partial revocation of trusts and declaration of new trusts dated 19 October 1943 the trusts of the first settlement were partially revoked and cancelled pursuant to the powers reserved to the settlor and certain of the trusts of the Trust Fund were redeclared and the Trustees were in effect directed to pay and apply the net income of the Trust Fund in and towards the maintenance, support, benefit, or advancement in life of the said Roy Allan McKenzie (hereinafter called the **life tenant**) until he should attain the age of 30 years, and upon his attaining such age, upon trust to pay the net income of the Trust Fund to him during the residue of his life, and after the death of the life tenant, upon trust for the child or children of the life tenant who attained the age of 21 years, and if more than 1 in equal shares, and it was provided that on failure of the said trusts certain contingent trusts should have effect---namely, 20,000 pounds should be paid or transferred to the trustees of a charitable trust created by the said John Robert McKenzie by deed dated 13 May 1938 under the name of ""The J. R. McKenzie Youth Education Fund"", and that the residue of the Trust Fund should be divided into 4 equal parts, 2 of which equal parts were directed to be held in trust for such of the grand nephews and grand nieces of the said John Robert McKenzie, being children of his niece Linda May Taylor and of his nephew Hugh Allen Carter, as should be living at the expiration of 21 years from 25 June 1940, 1 of which equal parts was directed to be paid or transferred to the Board of Trustees referred to in a certain deed of trust bearing date 12 February 1940 executed by the said John Robert McKenzie, under which deed certain preference shares of the nominal value of 100,000 pounds were transferred to Trustees and a Trust Fund of 100,000 pounds was created for charitable and/or educational purposes under the name of ""The J. R. McKenzie Trust"" (hereinafter called **The Charitable Trust**), and the remaining equal part was directed to be held for such charitable (including if thought fit) educational purpose or purposes as should be selected by the Trustees for the time being of the Trust Fund, with power to the Trustees to vary such purpose or purposes: 
    
    And whereas by a further deed of partial revocation of trusts and declaration of new trusts dated the said 19 October 1943 the trusts of the second settlement were partially revoked and cancelled pursuant to the powers reserved to the settlor, and certain of the trusts of the Trust Fund were redeclared and the Trustees thereunder were directed to pay and apply the net income of the Trust Fund for the benefit of the life tenant until he should attain the age of 25 years, and upon his attaining such age to pay such net income to him during the residue of his life, and after his death to hold the Trust Fund for the child or children of the life tenant who attains or attain the age of 21 years, and if more than 1 in equal shares; and it was provided that on failure of the said trusts certain contingent trusts should have effect: 
    
    And whereas the said contingent trusts were declared in a form similar to those declared in respect to the first settlement save and except that no further provision was made for the J. R. McKenzie Youth Education Fund: 
    
    And whereas the trusts of the charitable trust were varied by a private Act the short title of which is the [J. R. McKenzie Trust Act 1947][17]:
    
    And whereas the life tenant is now entitled to enjoyment of the income of the first and second settlements for his lifetime, but the ultimate destination of the trust funds being uncertain it is desirable that all doubts with respect thereto should be removed and that all contingent interests in the trust funds should be defined and converted into vested interests, and accordingly that the said trusts should be varied and redeclared, and it is desirable that certain new trusts should be declared in respect of the trust funds: 
    
    And whereas it is proposed that a company limited by shares should be incorporated under the provisions of the Companies Act 1933 having as its name ""McKenzies Staff Provident Association Limited"", and having as its principal objects the establishment and support and the aiding of associations, institutions, funds, trusts, amenities, and conveniences for the benefit of employees or ex-employees of the companies known as J. R. McKenzie Limited, McKenzies Department Stores Limited, or any subsidiary of those companies or the dependants of those persons: 
    
    And whereas all persons _sui juris_ and interested in the trust funds, whether beneficially or otherwise, have consented to the proposed variation and redeclaration of the said trusts and to the creation of the proposed new trusts: 
    
    And whereas the investments of the Trust Funds comprise shares in the capital of the company limited by shares and known as Rangatira Pty. Limited (hereinafter called _the Rangatira Company_), the nominal capital of which is 1,591,000 pounds divided into 1 591 000 shares of 1 pound each, including 391 000 shares in respect to which nothing has been paid up: 
    
    And whereas it is desirable that the said nominal capital should be reduced by the cancellation of the said 391 000 unpaid shares, whereupon the said nominal capital will amount to the sum of 1,200,000 pounds divided into 10 000 redeemable preference shares of 1 pound each (also called _Management shares_) and 1 190 000 ordinary shares of 1 pound each called ""A"" and ""B"" shares: 
    
    And whereas the rights, powers, and privileges attached to the respective classes of shares are set forth in certain special resolutions bearing date 30 November 1953, copies of which have been lodged in the office of the Assistant Registrar of Companies at Wellington and form part of the articles of association of the Rangatira Company: 
    
    And whereas the trustees of the charitable trust have agreed to accept an allotment of 566 000 ""B"" shares of 1 pound each in lieu of the 100 000 preference shares of 1 pound each comprising the capital of the trust fund of the charitable trust: And whereas by reason of the increase in capital of the Trust Fund it is desirable that the provisions of the deed creating the charitable trust should be further varied and amended in the manner hereinafter set forth: 
    
    And whereas the above-mentioned objects and powers cannot be attained except by legislation.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the McKenzie Trusts Act 1954\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 19 August 1954, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][23] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][24] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][25] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][26] and [17E][27] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
