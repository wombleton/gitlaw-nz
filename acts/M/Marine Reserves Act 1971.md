        *   (i) all persons owning any estate or interest in land in or adjoining the proposed reserve. For the purposes of this subparagraph, land shall be deemed to adjoin a proposed marine reserve notwithstanding that it is separated from it by the foreshore or by any road, or that is at a distance of not more than 100 metres from the proposed marine reserve if separated from it by any other reserve of any kind whatsoever or any marginal strip within the meaning of the [Conservation Act 1987][56]:
        
        *   (ii) any harbour board if the area or any part of the area proposed as a marine reserve is within the jurisdiction of that harbour board:

The plan shall be open for inspection free of charge during ordinary office hours by any person at the office of the Department nearest to the proposed reserve.
    
    (3) All persons wishing to object to the making of the order shall, within 2 months from the date of first publication of the notice published pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection (1), send their objections in writing, specifying the grounds thereof, to the Director-General and shall serve a copy of their objections, specifying the grounds thereof, on the applicant within the same time.
    
    (4) The applicant may, on receiving any copy of objections under subsection (3), answer those objections in writing to the Director-General within 3 months from the date of first publication of the notice published pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection (1), and the Director-General shall send any such answer he may receive within that time to the Minister for consideration.
    
    (5) The Director-General shall refer to the Minister all such objections received within the said period of 2 months, and any answer received within the said period of 3 months.
    
    (6) Where any objection has been made in accordance with subsection (3), the Minister shall, before considering the application, decide whether or not the objection should be upheld and, in doing so, shall take into consideration any answer made to the objection by the applicant and, if the applicant is the Director-General, any report on the objection and the application the Minister may have obtained from an independent source.

    *   (d) interfere unduly with or adversely affect any existing usage of the area for recreational purposes:
    
    *   (e) otherwise be contrary to the public interest.
    
    (7) The decision of the Minister shall be final.
    
    (7A) Before the decision of the Minister becomes final under subsection (7), the proposal must, to the extent that it relates to the proposed name of the proposed marine reserve, be referred to the New Zealand Geographic Board under [section 27(2)][57] or [30][58] of the New Zealand Geographic Board (Ngā Pou Taunaha o Aotearoa) Act 2008, as the case may be.
    
    (8) The Director-General shall cause the Minister's decision, together with the grounds therefor, to be notified in writing to the objector and to the applicant.
    
    (9) If, after consideration of all objections, the Minister is of the opinion that no objection should be upheld and that to declare the area a marine reserve will be in the best interests of scientific study and will be for the benefit of the public, and it is expedient that the area should be declared a marine reserve, either unconditionally or subject to any conditions (including any condition as to providing the cost of marking the boundaries of the marine reserve under [section 22][33], and any condition permitting fishing within the reserve by persons not holding a permit issued under [Part 4][48] of the Fisheries Act 1983), the Minister shall, if the Ministers of Transport and Fisheries concur, recommend to the Governor-General the making of an Order in Council accordingly.
    
    (10) If notice is required by this section to be given to any person, it shall be deemed to be given to all the owners of any Maori land within the meaning of the Maori Affairs Act 1953, when it is given to such owners as have been nominated for the purpose by the Registrar of the Maori Land Court at the request of the person required to give the notice. On receiving any such request the Registrar shall nominate all owners whose current addresses are known to him.
    
    (11) For the purposes of this section the expression **estate or interest in land** shall include any mining interest.
    
    (12) This section shall bind the Crown.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Marine Reserves Act 1971\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 July 2013, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][85] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][86] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][87] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][88] and [17E][89] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
