An Act to reverse the Conviction of John James Meikle on a Charge of Sheep-stealing.
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    WHEREAS in the year eighteen hundred and eighty-seven, at the sittings of the Supreme Court then held at Invercargill, John James Meikle was tried for the offence of sheep-stealing, and was convicted of the said offence and sentenced to imprisonment for the term of seven years: And whereas the said John James Meikle did thereafter suffer the said imprisonment in accordance with the judgment of the said Court: And whereas, in pursuance of a petition presented to Parliament by the said John James Meikle alleging that he was wrongly convicted of the said offence, two of the Judges of the Supreme Court were on the fifteenth day of March, nineteen hundred and six, appointed by the Governor as Commissioners for the purpose of inquiring into the truth of the matter: And whereas the said Commissioners have made full inquiry, and have reported that the evidence produced to them of the guilt of the said John James Meikle is so far from conclusive that if the said inquiry had been a retrial it would have been proper to acquit the said John James Meikle of the said offence: And whereas it is expedient to give effect to the report of the said Commissioners in manner hereinafter appearing:

BE IT THEREFORE ENACTED by the General Assembly of New Zealand in Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:---
