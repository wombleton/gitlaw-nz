    And whereas it is desirable to give the said Council powers to obtain pipeline easement and other rights and appurtenances over Maori land through which the pipeline connected with the said water supply passes:

    (1) The court is hereby authorised and empowered to grant to the said Council by order an easement in perpetuity or for a limited term for the use, occupation, and enjoyment of any Maori land whereon or whereunder any pipeline connected with or appertaining to the said water supply shall be, together with the right to enter upon such land or through or over any adjoining land for the purpose of altering, renewing, repairing, or cleansing such pipeline, subject to such terms and conditions as the court may think fit to impose.
    
    (2) Any order made granting rights as aforesaid may be registered against the land which it affects, and it shall not be necessary in the case of land subject to the Land Transfer Act 1915 to produce any certificate of title for the purpose of such registration.
    
    (3) If the said Council ceases for a period of 2 years to use any land in respect of which an order granting rights as aforesaid has been made, such land shall (subject, however, to any special conditions contained in the order made in respect thereof) upon the expiration of such period of 2 years revert to the then owner of the land over which the same was originally ordered, but the said Council shall not be liable to the owner or any other person for so ceasing to use the land. Upon proof to his satisfaction that the right has so reverted to the owner the District Land Registrar may enter upon the Register a memorandum thereof, and such right shall thereupon be deemed to have been determined.
    
    (4) The Council or any person interested may at any time apply to the court for the surrender of any right granted hereunder, and the court may order that the land therein mentioned shall cease to be subject to the right or easement, and any such order may be registered accordingly.

    And whereas various areas of Crown land in pursuance of the powers in that behalf have been or may be permanently reserved for the purpose:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    (1) Where the names of persons deemed to be beneficial owners of any land so reserved as aforesaid, or any part thereof, have been published in the _Gazette_ or _Kahiti_ and titles therefor have not already been issued, the District Land Registrar of the appropriate land registration district is authorised, on the request of the Minister of Maori Affairs or any person interested, to issue a certificate of title vesting any part of such land in fee simple in the persons named in such _Gazette_ or _Kahiti_ for an estate in fee simple as tenants in common in the relative interests set out, which relative interests shall be expressed in shares in lieu of acres. Such title shall antevest as from the date of the land being permanently reserved for the purpose.
    
    (2) Where the names of the persons deemed to be entitled have not been published as aforesaid and the Governor-General is satisfied that the beneficial owners have been ascertained after due inquiry, the Governor-General may, by Warrant under his hand, direct the District Land Registrar to issue a certificate of title for any such land to which they may be found entitled to the persons so deemed to be entitled, and the District Land Registrar is authorised to issue certificates of title accordingly, vesting the land in the persons entitled as tenants in common in the relative interests set out.

    (5) The said land, or any interest therein, may be acquired by and alienated to the Crown as fully and freely and in the same manner as if it was ordinary Maori land or land within the meaning of the principal Act and any statutory provision to the contrary is declared not to affect such lands.
    
    (6) If and whenever the said land or any portion thereof is not the subject of an alienation or is not in the occupation of any of the beneficial owners, the Governor-General may, by Order in Council published in the _Gazette_, resume such land or any part thereof, and thereupon the said land shall again become Crown land freed and discharged from any right or claim thereto by the beneficial owner. The former beneficial owners thereof shall be entitled to compensation as if the land had been taken for a public work, and all the provisions of the Public Works Act 1928 as to payment and assessment of compensation shall apply accordingly.
    
    (7) Where the court is satisfied that any beneficial owner cannot be found and that it is in the interests of the owner or in the public interest that the land should be alienated, it may make an order appointing the MƒÅori Trustee to execute as agent and in the name of the owner any instrument of alienation, which instrument may be confirmed, and shall thereupon have the same force and effect, and may be registered in the same manner, as if executed by the owner. All proceeds of any such alienation shall be paid to the MƒÅori Trustee, who shall hold the same in trust for the person beneficially entitled thereto.

    (9) Where any land permanently reserved pursuant to the enactments referred to in the recital to this section has not been allocated, that land may be dealt with as if it were ordinary Crown land subject to the [Land Act 1948][180].

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Maori Purposes Act 1931\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 July 2013, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][187] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][188] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][1] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][189] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][1] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][190] and [17E][191] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][1] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][1] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   ‚Ä¢omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   ‚Ä¢typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   ‚Ä¢layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   ‚Ä¢indentation
        *   ‚Ä¢position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   ‚Ä¢format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   ‚Ä¢format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   ‚Ä¢position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   ‚Ä¢punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   ‚Ä¢Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   ‚Ä¢case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   ‚Ä¢format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   ‚Ä¢small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   ‚Ä¢schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   ‚Ä¢running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   ‚Ä¢format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
