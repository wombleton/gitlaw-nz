    WHEREAS in pursuance of The Religious, Charitable, and Educational Trusts Act 1856, a certain deed, bearing date the thirty-first day of October, one thousand eight hundred and fifty-six, was enrolled in the Supreme of New Zealand, at Auckland, as the Model Deed of the society denominated Methodists, which deed was also registered in the Register of Deeds Office, at Auckland, as No 9252A: And whereas most of the lands of the said society have been conveyed or settled upon the trusts of the said deed as to those lands not under the operation of the Land Transfer Act by means of conveyances referring to the trusts in the said Model Deed, and as to other lands by means of separate declarations of trusts executed by the Trustees of such lands: And whereas such society, denominated Methodists (hereinafter called ""the Methodist Church in New Zealand""), has always formed an integral part of the Australasian Wesleyan Methodist Church, as constituted from time to time by the English Wesleyan Methodist Conference: And whereas the said Australasian Methodist Church has now a separate and independent constitution, approved of and adopted by the said English Conference, and now consists of four annual conferences, called respectively the New South Wales and Queensland Conference, the Victoria and Tasmania Conference, the South Australian Conference, and the New Zealand Conference, all being governed by a General Conference assembling once in every three years, or at such other intervals more or less as it may deem expedient, each such annual Conference having amongst other things the power of appointing its own ministers, a copy of which constitution, and also a copy of the Deed Poll of John Wesley, hereinafter referred to, are set forth in the [Schedule][12] to ""The Methodist Model Deed of New Zealand 1887"", hereinafter particularly mentioned: And whereas by the authority of the General Conference, and with the sanction and approval of the said English Conference, a new Model Deed has been prepared and adopted by the New Zealand Conference, containing trusts and provisions adapted and assimilated to the present constitution of the Methodist Church in New Zealand to the intent that all lands belonging to or held on behalf of such Church may hereafter be held upon such trusts and provisions, and discharged from all present trusts, and the said New Zealand Conference has been duly authorised by the said General Conference, with the approval of the English Conference, to obtain an Act of the Legislature of New Zealand for the purposes hereinafter set forth: And whereas such new Model Deed is dated the thirtieth day of September, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-seven, and is made, or expressed to be made between John Edson, chemist and druggist, and Thomas Buddle, solicitor, both of Auckland, in New Zealand, of the one part, and William Griffiths, John Hosking, Thomas Cooke, Richard Arthur, Joseph Liston Wilson, Frederick Lambert Prime, James Wiseman, James Buttle, and Thomas McMaster, therein described of the other part, and is registered in the Deeds Registry Office at Auckland as No 105415, and deposited in the said office as No 6322: And whereas it is necessary to obtain power for carrying some of the trusts and provisions contained in such last-mentioned deed into effect, and for providing for the due succession of Trustees without conveyance or transfer, and for creating facilities of proof:
