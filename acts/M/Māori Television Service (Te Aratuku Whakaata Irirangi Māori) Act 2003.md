*   #### Preamble
    
    ###### He kōrero whakataki
        
    *   (1) I roto i tana Pūrongo mō _Te Reo Maori_ (WAI 11) ka whakatauhia e te Rūnanga Whakamana i te Tiriti o Waitangi e whai mana ana te Tiriti o Waitangi ki te whakapūmau wāhi noho tahitanga mō ngā iwi e rua ki Aotearoa. Ka whakatau te Rūnanga, he iho matua taketake te reo Māori nō ngā tikanga Māori, ā, me noho tonu mai hei taonga tūturu. Ka puta hoki te whakapae a te Rūnanga mēnā ka taea ngā mātāpono me ngā whāinga whānui te whakatutuki ki te kore e kitea he ahurewa tōtika mō te reo Māori. I whakatauhia anō hoki e te Rūnanga he here tā te Tiriti kia kaha ake te ūtanga o te Karauna ki te tiaki i te reo Māori. Ka whakaae te Karauna ki ēnei whakatau:
    
    *   (2) I te whiu ā-ture, ko te whakatau a te Komiti ā-Ture a te Kaunihera Piriwiri i te marama o Hakihea 1993 (_Kaunihera Māori v Te Toa Ture Tianara_ \[1994\] 1 NZLR 513) tōna otinga, ka whakaae te Karauna he here mutunga kore tā ngā mātāpono o te Tiriti o Waitangi ki te pīkau kia pūmau tonu te manaaki i te reo Māori mā te whakamahia o ngā mahi pāpāho reo irirangi, whakaata irirangi anō hoki:
    
    *   (3) I roto i tēra whiu ā-ture ka whakatakotoria e te Karauna tāna kaupapa takawā e hāngai ana, i tua atu i ētahi atu āhuatanga, ki te whanaketanga o tētahi ratonga whakaata irirangi Māori motuhake. Ko te Aratuku Whakaata Irirangi Māori tētahi otinga nui o te kaupapa i kōkiritia hei tiaki, hei whakatairanga i te reo Māori i runga whakaata irirangi:
    
    *   (4) Ko te tikanga mā te whakatūranga o te Aratuku Whakaata Irirangi e whai wāhi maru ai te reo Māori me ngā tikanga Māori, ā, e whai mana ai, e kaha ake ai te whakatairanga kia tutuki ai te whakaū a te Karauna ki te tiaki ki te whakatairanga anō hoki i te reo Māori me ngā tikanga Māori mā roto i ngā mahi pāpāho.
    
    ###### Background in English
        
    *   (1) In its _Te Reo Maori Report_ (Wai 11), the Waitangi Tribunal found that the Treaty of Waitangi was directed to ensuring a place for 2 peoples in New Zealand. The Tribunal found that the Māori language is an essential part of Māori culture and must be regarded as a taonga, a valued possession. The Tribunal questioned whether the principles and broad objectives of the Treaty of Waitangi could be achieved without a recognised place for the Māori language. The Tribunal found that the Crown is obliged by the Treaty to take active steps to protect the Māori language. The Crown accepted these findings:
    
    *   (2) In the litigation that culminated in the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in December 1993 (_New Zealand Maori Council v Attorney General_ \[1994\] 1 NZLR 513), the Crown accepted that the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi impose a continuing obligation to take such steps as are reasonable to assist in the preservation of te reo Māori by the use of both radio and television broadcasting:
    
    *   (3) In that litigation, the Crown outlined a time frame relating to, among other things, the development of special purpose Māori television. The Māori Television Service is a key result of the policy developed for protecting and promoting te reo Māori on television:
    
    *   (4) The establishment of the Māori Television Service in which te reo Māori me ngā tikanga Māori have a secure place and are recognised and actively promoted is intended to contribute to meeting the Crown's commitment to the protection and promotion of te reo Māori me ngā tikanga Māori through broadcasting.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Māori Television Service (Te Aratuku Whakaata Irirangi Māori) Act 2003\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 July 2013, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][147] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][148] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][149] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][150] and [17E][151] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
