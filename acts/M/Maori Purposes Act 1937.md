    (3) The trustees appointed to administer the said Maori reservation shall have a seal in a form to be approved by the Minister of Maori Affairs. The seal shall not be affixed to any instrument except by the authority of a resolution passed by the trustees assembled together in a meeting, and in the presence of 2 trustees for the time being in office, who shall also sign the instrument.
    
    (4) Any instrument in writing requiring to be executed by the trustees may be signed and sealed as aforesaid, and any instrument purporting to have been executed in accordance with the provisions of this section shall, in the absence of proof to the contrary, for all purposes be deemed to have been duly executed.

The expenditure of money upon or in respect of the said lands or any part thereof in respect of improvements, buildings, or otherwise before the passing of this Act shall be deemed to be expenditure duly authorised under this section.
    
    (6) Any Maori Land Board, the East Coast Commissioner, the Maori Trustee, or any local authority, corporate body, company, or person (including trustees) may contribute to the fund for the purpose of furthering the objects thereof, and any payment or contribution so made shall be deemed to be a payment lawfully made, anything in any Act to the contrary notwithstanding.
    
    (7) The assembled owners of any parcel of Maori land or the committee of any land vested in the East Coast Commissioner may pass a resolution that such sum as may be specified shall be paid to the fund out of any rent or other money which is due or accruing due or may become due in the future, either in one sum or by instalments. Any resolution heretofore passed for the purpose set forth in this section shall enure for the purposes of this section as if it had originated thereunder, and shall be deemed to have so originated.
    
    (8) It shall be lawful for a Maori Land Board, the Maori Trustee, or the East Coast Commissioner to make advances out of their respective accounts of the whole or any part of the amounts directed by any resolution passed under the last preceding subsection, or by any order of the Court setting aside any rents or other money for the purpose, to be paid in anticipation of rents or other money to become due or payable, and to charge the money so advanced against the land affected.
