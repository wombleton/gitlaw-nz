## Part 3  
Services for members of Parliament

##### 16 Principles 
    
*   (1) In making a determination or issuing directions under this Part, the Remuneration Authority, the Speaker, and the Minister Responsible for Ministerial Services must have regard to the following principles:
        
    *   (a) that the entitlements of members of Parliament and Ministers to support services should be determined in a way that---
            
        *   (i) recognises the need for public understanding of the work of those persons and their parties and the services they require to enable them to carry out their roles and functions; and
        
        *   (ii) facilitates the delivery of support services in an efficient and effective manner; and
        
        *   (iii) recognises the need to be fair to the taxpayer; and
        
        *   (iv) promotes transparency in relation to the allocation and use of public money to provide the support services necessary for members of Parliament, Ministers, and parties to carry out their respective roles and functions; and
        
        *   (v) maintains confidence in the integrity of Parliament; and
        
        *   (vi) maintains the independence of the Remuneration Authority:
        
        
    
    *   (b) that entitlements to services should be determined in a way that has regard to the particular requirements of any members of Parliament with physical or sensory impairments:
    
    *   (c) that, if services provided include an element of remuneration or result in any other private benefit, the value of that benefit should be taken into account by the Remuneration Authority in determining relevant salaries and allowances under [Part 2][8]:
    
    *   (d) that entitlements to services should be---
            
        *   (i) clearly defined so that decisions about whether a person or party is eligible for an entitlement can easily be made; and
        
        *   (ii) determined in a way that is consistent with the objectives of efficient and effective delivery of services; and
        
        *   (iii) simple to administer.
        
        
    
    (2) If an entitlement to a service under a determination made by the Remuneration Authority under [section 17][20], directions issued by the Speaker under[section 23][27], or a determination made by the Speaker under [section 34][41] or by the Minister Responsible for Ministerial Services under [section 27][32], results in an element of personal benefit or potential personal benefit for members of Parliament, Ministers, or their family members,---
        
    *   (a) the Remuneration Authority, the Speaker, or the Minister Responsible for Ministerial Services, as the case may be, must---
            
        *   (i) consult the Commissioner of Inland Revenue about the taxation consequences of that entitlement; and
        
        *   (ii) assess the value of the benefit; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) the value must be taken into account by the Remuneration Authority in determining the salaries and allowances of the relevant members of Parliament or Ministers under [section 8][9]; and
    
    *   (c) the Remuneration Authority must include in its determination of the salaries and allowances under [section 8][9] a statement that sets out how it has taken that value into account in determining the relevant salaries and allowances.
