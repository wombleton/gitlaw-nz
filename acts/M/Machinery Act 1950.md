##### 33 Owner may have actual offender charged
    
*   (1) An owner who is charged with an offence under this Act may commence proceedings against any other person whom the owner alleges to be the actual offender, and have that person brought before the District Court Judge on the same charge; and to enable both charges to be heard together the charges against the owner may be adjourned for such time as the District Court Judge thinks reasonable.
    
    (2) In any such case, if the charges are heard together and the offence is proved but the District Court Judge finds that---
        
    *   (a) the offence was committed in fact by the said other person, without the knowledge, consent, or connivance of the owner; and

    that other person shall be convicted of the offence, and the owner shall not be guilty of the offence.
    
    (3) If, before the commencement of any proceedings against the owner in respect of any offence under this Act, the Inspector is satisfied that if any other person were charged with the offence under the foregoing provisions of this section that other person would be convicted of the offence, the Inspector shall proceed against the person whom he believes to be the actual offender without first proceeding against the owner. In any such case the provisions of subsection (2) shall, with the necessary modifications, apply, notwithstanding that no proceedings have been commenced against the owner.
