## Part 3  
Quota markets and registration of exporters

##### 21 Purpose of this Part
    
*   The purpose of this Part is---
        
    *   (a) to provide for compliance with New Zealand's international treaty obligations relating to quota markets by or through the Board on behalf of the Crown; and
    
    *   (b) to provide for the administration of the allocation of access to such quota markets; and
    
    *   (c) to ensure that the meat industry is the recipient of the economic benefits deriving from quota markets.
    
    

##### 22 Crown owns right to secure economic benefits from quota markets
    
*   The Crown owns the rights to secure the economic benefits deriving from quota markets, and those benefits are assigned for the benefit of the meat industry as provided in this Act.

##### 23 Board to consider establishment of quota allocation mechanisms in certain circumstances
    
*   Where a quota market exists, the Board must establish and operate a mechanism for the allocation of access to that quota market if satisfied that the operation of an allocation mechanism would be consistent with the Board's objects.
    
    Compare: 1997 No 105 s 26

##### 24 Requirements for allocation mechanisms
    
*   (1) The Board must not establish any particular allocation mechanism for any quota market unless it is consistent with the Board's objects.
    
    (2) An allocation mechanism---
        
    *   (a) must provide for or allow trading in allocated access; and
    
    *   (b) must provide for the allocation of access to existing participants in the meat export industry who are prospective participants in the market concerned; and
    
    *   (c) must provide for the proportionate adjustment of amounts of access already allocated or set aside under it where there has been an alteration of the total access at zero or concessional tariff rates to the market concerned.
    
    (3) An allocation mechanism must also specify---
        
    *   (a) the products to which it applies:
    
    *   (b) the quantity of products to which it applies:
    
    *   (c) the country or group of countries where the relevant quota market exists:
    
    *   (d) the tariff rate applying to each product concerned.
    
    (4) Without limiting what an allocation mechanism may include, an allocation mechanism may provide for consideration to be given to the proportion of quota allocated to a particular quota holder or applicant that was unused in the previous year when determining the allocation of quota or any adjustment of allocation of quota to that quota holder or applicant for any year.
    
    (5) To avoid doubt, an allocation mechanism may provide for an allocation of access to quota markets to any person who is a registered exporter, whether or not the person currently exports meat products.

*   (1) An allocation mechanism must not contain any element that---

    *   (b) imposes (or provides for the imposition of) any condition or limitation on the allocation of access to the market concerned to any person on the ground that the person has not given a liability undertaking; or

    (2) An allocation mechanism must not contain any element having any of the effects specified in subsection (3), or contain any power to make the allocation of access to the market concerned subject to the imposition of any condition or requirement, except to the extent (if any) that is necessary---
        
    *   (a) to ensure that the mechanism is consistent with the Board's objects; or
    
    *   (b) to avoid jeopardising the continuing acceptance by authorities responsible for a quota market of the allocation by authorities in New Zealand of access to that market on current terms.
    
    (3) The effects referred to in subsection (2) are---
        
    *   (a) excluding persons from the allocation of access to the market concerned:

    *   (c) discriminating between persons.
    
    (4) An allocation mechanism must not require persons to give (or provide for persons to be required to give) information to the Board, except to the extent (if any) that is necessary to enable the mechanism to operate effectively.

    *   (b) no impact on whether or not a person receives any allocation in any subsequent year, and

    *   (b) the person is the holder of a valid quota certificate for the meat product issued by the Board under [section 33][37]; and
    
    *   (c) the export is in accordance with that allocation mechanism and that certificate.

    *   (b) if (by virtue of [section 24][28] or [section 25][29]) the Board would be required to establish an allocation mechanism different from the mechanism reviewed, it must, as soon as practicable, replace the mechanism reviewed with a different mechanism.
