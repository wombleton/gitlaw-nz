##### 12 Pending grant of probate or administration, Māori Trustee may administer estates of deceased Maoris
    
*   (1) Where any Maori dies, whether testate or intestate (and notwithstanding that some person other than the Māori Trustee is appointed executor, or is entitled to letters of administration), the Māori Trustee may, if he thinks fit, until administration is granted, exercise with respect to the estate of the deceased person all such powers and authorities and do all such acts and things as he would have or could exercise or do if the deceased had died intestate and the Māori Trustee had obtained administration:
    
    provided that the Māori Trustee shall not sell, lease, exchange, mortgage, or partition any portion of the property unless the property is ordered to be sold, leased, exchanged, mortgaged, or partitioned by a Judge of the High Court on the application of the Māori Trustee, which order a Judge of the High Court is hereby authorised to make:
    
    provided also that the Māori Trustee may sell, without obtaining an order of a Judge of the High Court, any portion of the personal estate that is of a perishable nature or is liable to deteriorate or is for any other reason liable to decrease unduly in value if retained; and the decision of the Māori Trustee as to whether any portion of the personal estate is of a perishable nature or is liable to deteriorate or is for any reason liable to decrease unduly in value if retained shall be conclusive and binding upon all persons whomsoever.
    
    (2) Before the Māori Trustee first acts under this section in respect of any estate he shall give notice, in writing or by telegram, to any person in New Zealand known to him who is of full age and full mental capacity and would be entitled to obtain administration, that he intends to so act unless that person forthwith proceeds to apply for administration.
    
    (2A) If that person does not, within a period of 21 days after the posting of the notice or the dispatching of the telegram, give notice, in writing or by telegram, to the Māori Trustee at Wellington that he intends to apply for administration, or if that person gives such notice but fails for 14 days thereafter so to apply, or makes such application and it fails, then, unless the court otherwise orders, the Māori Trustee may proceed to exercise all or any of the powers and authorities conferred by subsection (1).
    
    (2B) If more persons than 1 are entitled to take out administration, it shall be sufficient to give notice to one of those persons only.
    
    (2C) Nothing in this section shall, where it is not actually known to the Māori Trustee that there is in New Zealand any person entitled to obtain administration, or in any case of emergency (of which emergency the Māori Trustee shall be the sole judge) prevent the Māori Trustee from exercising the powers and authorities given by subsection (1) without giving such notice as aforesaid.
    
    (3) All costs, charges, and expenses incurred by the Māori Trustee under this section shall be a first charge upon the property of the deceased. Any person who afterwards obtains a grant of probate or letters of administration of the estate shall, before acting thereon, pay all costs, charges, commissions, and expenses incurred by or payable to the Māori Trustee under this section.
    
    (4) The Māori Trustee, acting under this section, shall not be deemed to be or to be liable as an executor or administrator _de son tort_.
    
    (5) On the grant of probate or of letters of administration to any person other than the Māori Trustee, the Māori Trustee shall furnish to the executor or administrator a statement in writing of his administration of the estate of the deceased pursuant to this section, with such particulars as the executor or administrator may properly require.

    (2) On any such election being filed, the Māori Trustee shall be deemed to be the executor of the will or the administrator of the estate, as the case may require, in like manner and to the same extent in all respects as if administration had been duly granted to him.
    
    (3) Every such election shall set forth the name, residence, and occupation of the deceased so far as the same are then known to the Māori Trustee, and the date of the death of the deceased and the property situated in New Zealand of the deceased as then known.
    
    (4) The election shall contain, in every case where the deceased died intestate, a statement to that effect, and in every case where the deceased died testate, a statement that after due inquiries the Māori Trustee believes that the document annexed to the election is the testator's last will (or an exemplification thereof where administration has been granted out of New Zealand) and that the will has been validly executed according to the law governing the execution of wills.
    
    (5) Any such election as aforesaid may be filed in the registry of the High Court at Wellington or in such other registry of the High Court as may either generally or in respect of particular estates be determined by the Māori Trustee.
    
    (6) If after filing any such election as aforesaid the gross value of the property situated in New Zealand to be administered is found to exceed the sum of $60,000, the Māori Trustee shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, file in the registry of the High Court in which the election to administer was filed a memorandum under seal stating the fact; and shall thereupon proceed in the ordinary manner to obtain a grant of administration in New Zealand; and for that purpose may uplift from the court any will or exemplification filed with the election.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Maori Trustee Act 1953\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 16 November 2009, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][171] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][172] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][1] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][173] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][1] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][174] and [17E][175] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][1] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][1] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
