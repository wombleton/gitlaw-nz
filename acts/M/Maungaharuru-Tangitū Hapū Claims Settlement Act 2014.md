    (8) Ka whāki atu anō te Karauna arā ko te nuinga o ngā whenua i roto i te rohe raupatu i whakaae ai ia ki te whakahoki ki a Ngāi Māori te mana pupuri i te tau 1870 ka puritia tonu e te Karauna te mana kō atu i te whā tekau tau tae noa atu ki te tukunga o ngā tohanga a te Karauna i ngā mana pupuri ki a Ngāi Māori i noho pū ki aua whenua.
    
    (9) Ka whāki te Karauna kāore rawa ia i whakarite i tētahi tirotiro motuhake i ngā hua tuku iho o te Hapū ki ngā rohe whenua i whakaae ia kia whakahokia atu ki a Ngāi Māori te mana pupuri i te tau 1870 ā---
        
    *   (a) I te tau 1870 i tukua e ia kō atu i te 30 000 eka ki Kaiwaka hei tākoha atu ki tētahi kūpapa a te Karauna; ā
    
    *   (b) I parea e te Karauna ngā uri o te Hapū mai i ngā mana pupuri mō Kaiwaka ā he takahanga hoki i te Tiriti o Waitangi me ōna mātāpono.
    
    (10) E whāki ake ana te Karauna nā tana kore e rongo i ngā tono maha a te Hapū kia tirotirohia ō rātau tika ki Kaiwaka i kino atu ai te whakatoihara a te takahanga nei. I amohia e te Hapū ngā tūmomo utu teitei mō ngā raru ture i tā rātau whai i ō rātau tika ki Kaiwaka.
    
    (11) E whāki ana te Karauna ā---
        
    *   (a) Kāore ia i uiui atu ki te Hapū i mua i te tukunga o ngā ture whenua taketake i te rautau tekau mā iwa i puta ai te tikanga kia tū ko ia tangata noa hei mana pupuri whenua i riro ai taua mana pupuri ki te iwi katoa i mua atu; ā
    
    *   (b) I te tau 1866 i tukua e te Kōti Whenua Taketake te mana pupuri mō te whenua rāhui o Moeangiangi me ngā rohe whenua o Petane o Te Pāhou hoki ki ngā tāngata tokoiti iho i te tekau a tae rawa atu ki te tau 1873 kua hokona kē e ia mana pupuri te katoa o ngā rohe whenua a te Hapū; ā
    
    *   (c) Mā te tuku i aua tāngata ki te hoko noa i ngā whenua rāhui ki Moeangiangi me ngā rohe whenua o Petane me Te Pāhou nā te Hapū kē kāore te ture whenua taketake i whai i ngā ōati a te Karauna kia haumaruhia ngā hua a te Hapū ki aua rohe whenua ā he takahanga hoki i te Tiriti o Waitangi me ōna mātāpono.
    
    (12) E whāki ana te Karauna ko te tukunga here o te Tonga o Tangoio ki te Poari Whenua Māori o te Takiwā o Ikaroa i te tau 1907 he takahanga hoki i te Tiriti o Waitangi me ōna mātāpono.
    
    (13) E whāki ana te Karauna mai i te tau 1911 ki te tau 1930 i hokona tata ki te katoa o ngā whenua i whakahokia atu ki ia uri o te Hapū i te tau 1870\. E whāki ake ana hoki te Karauna nāna pū---
        
    *   (a) Te mahi tinihanga ki roto i ngā ture whenua taketake mō Ngāi Māori ki te whakatau ā-rōpū nei kātahi ka huri ake ki te hoko haere i te maha o ngā whenua mai ia mana pupuri i muri ake i ngā whakataunga o ngā huihuinga kia kaua e hoko i ō rātau whenua; ā
    
    *   (b) Kāhore i hāngai pū ngā mahi a te Karauna i tōna mana apunga nā tana ārai i ētahi mana pupuri whenua o te Hapū ki te whakaoti ake i ā rātau whiriwhiri me ngā hunga motuhake ki te kawe i ngā rīhi mō ō rātau whenua kia wātea ai te Karauna ki te hoko; ā

    (14) Ka whāki ake te Karauna nā tana kore e haumaru i te Hapū mai i te noho kore whenua mō ō rātau hiahia o aua wā me ngā wā ō muri mai ā tae rawa atu ki ngā tau o ngā 1930s---

Ka whāki ake anō te Karauna---

    ###### Acknowledgements
    
    (1) The Crown acknowledges that addressing the grievances of the Hapū is long overdue.
    
    (2) The Crown acknowledges that when it purchased the Ahuriri block in 1851---
        
    *   (a) it failed to consult the Hapū in the first stage of the negotiations; and
    
    *   (b) the Crown sought to purchase this land for the lowest price Māori would accept, and was aware that the Hapū were discontented with their share of the purchase price; and
    
    *   (c) Tangoio Māori did not receive the full, ongoing economic benefits from European settlement the Crown led them to expect if they agreed to sell for the price offered by the Crown; and
    
    *   (d) the Crown did not ensure that adequate reserves of land from the Ahuriri purchase were protected in Hapū ownership, and this was a breach of the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles.
    
    (3) The Crown acknowledges that when it acquired the Mohaka block in 1851---
        
    *   (a) it paid a low price, and Ngāi Tahu did not receive the full, ongoing benefits from European settlement they were led to expect in accepting a low price; and
    
    *   (b) it breached the Treaty of Waitangi by failing to ensure that adequate reserves were set aside for Ngāi Tahu.
    
    (4) The Crown acknowledges that in 1866, rather than continue negotiations to preserve the peace at Omarunui, it issued an unreasonable ultimatum demanding the surrender of all those inside the pā. This led to a Crown military attack, which endangered the lives of all men, women, and children inside the pā. The Crown's forces killed more than 20 people defending themselves at Omarunui and Petane. The Crown acknowledges that these attacks were an injustice and breached the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles.
    
    (5) The Crown acknowledges that the detention without trial in harsh conditions on the Chatham Islands for nearly 2 years of at least 13 members of the Hapū after they were interrogated at Omarunui was an injustice and a breach of the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles.
    
    (6) The Crown acknowledges that the summary executions by Crown forces at Ngatapa in January 1869 breached the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles and tarnished the honour of the Crown.
    
    (7) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) in 1867 it proclaimed a confiscation district which included most of the takiwā of the Hapū; and
    
    *   (b) subsequently, all the customary interests of the Hapū in their land in this district were extinguished and the Crown retained the Tangoio North block of more than 9 000 acres and these actions breached the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles.
    
    (8) The Crown further acknowledges that most of the land in the confiscation district, which it agreed to return to Māori ownership in 1870, remained in Crown title for more than 40 years until Crown grants were issued to the Māori owners who had been occupying it.
    
    (9) The Crown acknowledges that it never provided for any independent investigation of the customary interests of the Hapū in the blocks it agreed to return to Māori ownership in 1870 and that---
        
    *   (a) in 1870 it used more than 30 000 acres at Kaiwaka to reward a Crown ally; and
    
    *   (b) the Crown excluded Hapū members from the ownership of Kaiwaka and this was a breach of the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles.
    
    (10) The Crown further acknowledges that it made the prejudice arising from this breach worse by declining repeated requests from the Hapū to allow an investigation into their rights in Kaiwaka. The Hapū bore crippling legal expenses as a result of trying to establish their legal rights to Kaiwaka.
    
    (11) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) it did not consult the Hapū before introducing native land laws in the 19th century, which provided for the individualisation of Māori land holdings that had previously been held in tribal tenure; and
    
    *   (b) in 1866 the Native Land Court awarded ownership of the Moeangiangi Reserve and the Petane and Te Pahou blocks to fewer than 10 individuals, and by 1873, individual owners had sold all the Hapū land in these blocks; and
    
    *   (c) by allowing these individuals to sell Hapū land in the Moeangiangi Reserve and the Petane and Te Pahou blocks, the native land legislation did not reflect the Crown's obligation to actively protect the interests of the Hapū in these blocks, and this was a breach of the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles.
    
    (12) The Crown acknowledges that the compulsory vesting of Tangoio South in the Ikaroa District Māori Land Board in 1907 breached the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles.
    
    (13) The Crown acknowledges that between 1911 and 1930 it purchased nearly all of the land returned to Hapū individuals in 1870\. The Crown further acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) it made a sham of a provision in the native land laws for Māori to make land alienation decisions collectively by purchasing substantial quantities of land from individual owners after the owners had collectively decided at hui not to sell their land; and
    
    *   (b) the Crown misused its monopoly powers by preventing some land owners of the Hapū from completing negotiations with private parties to lease their land so the Crown could purchase it; and
    
    *   (c) it further misused its monopoly powers by imposing them for long periods on some owners who had shown no inclination to sell to the Crown and were left with little choice but to sell to the Crown if they wished to derive economic benefits from their land; and
    
    *   (d) the Crown exploited the willingness of some owners to sell, to acquire so much land that those who did not wish to sell were left with too little land to maintain a viable presence in the region; and
    
    *   (e) the Crown's actions were unfair, oppressive, and did not live up to the standards of good faith and fair dealing, which are expressed in the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles.
    
    (14) The Crown acknowledges that its failure to protect the Hapū from being left with insufficient land for their present and future needs by the 1930s---
        
    *   (a) had a devastating impact on their economic, social, and cultural well-being and on their development and was a breach of the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles; and
    
    *   (b) contributed to significant population losses suffered by the Hapū before 1930, and that for too long Hapū members have endured poverty, poor health, poor housing, and low educational standards.
    
    (15) The Crown acknowledges that extensive deforestation and pastoral farming in the late 19th and early 20th centuries has contributed to significant environmental change in the Hapū takiwā with increased erosion and flooding. The Crown further acknowledges---
        
    *   (a) the poor health of Lake Tūtira: 
    
    *   (b) the pollution of the coastline:
    
    *   (c) the degradation and loss of many mahinga kai of the Hapū:
    
    *   (d) the severe impact of flooding on the community and marae at Tangoio.

    (6) Mā roto mai i tēnei whakataunga e rapu ana te Karauna i te huarahi hei tāpae ake i ana mahi hē ki te Hapū ki te whakaū i te mana ki tōna taumata me te tīmata ake i te hātepe whakaora. E manako ana te Karauna mā te whakapāha nei e toko ake ai he hononga hōu i waenga i te Karauna me te Hapū mai i te piripono ki te Tiriti o Waitangi me ōna mātāpono.
    
    ###### Apology
    
    (1) The Crown makes this apology to the Hapū, their ancestors, and their descendants.
    
    (2) The Crown is deeply sorry that it has not always lived up to its Treaty of Waitangi obligations and that it has breached the Treaty of Waitangi, and its principles, in its dealings with the Hapū. The Crown recognises the tireless efforts and struggles of the ancestors of the Hapū in the pursuit of their longstanding claims for justice and redress from the Crown.
    
    (3) The Crown is deeply remorseful for its unjust attacks on Omarunui and Petane in 1866, the deaths that were caused, and the subsequent imprisonment of some of your people. The Crown sincerely apologises for the immense prejudice it inflicted on the Hapū by the proclamation of a confiscation district, the loss of Tangoio North, and the exclusion of the Hapū from the ownership of Kaiwaka.
    
    (4) The Crown profoundly regrets compounding this prejudice by purchasing most of the remaining land of the Hapū before 1930 in ways that were unfair and oppressive. The Crown is very sorry it left the Hapū virtually landless, and for the harm this caused to your tribal structures and ability to exercise customary rights and responsibilities. The Crown apologises for its failure to respect the rangatiratanga of the Hapū and for Crown acts and omissions which have impacted on your lands, fisheries, and other taonga, and your capacity for social and economic development.
    
    (5) The Crown acknowledges that many family lines have died out and cannot be brought back. It profoundly regrets the poverty and poor health which have long afflicted your people. It deeply regrets its acts and omissions which have affected your capacity for social and economic development and your physical, cultural, and spiritual well-being.
    
    (6) Through this settlement the Crown is seeking to atone for its past wrongs towards the Hapū, to restore its tarnished honour, and to begin the process of healing. The Crown hopes that this apology will mark the beginning of a new relationship between the Crown and the Hapū based on respect for the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles.
