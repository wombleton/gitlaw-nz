An Act to vary the terms of the will of the late Marianne Caughey Preston, of Auckland, married woman, by increasing the provision therein made for one Reginald Caughey Seymour Smith
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    Whereas Reginald Caughey Seymour Smith, of Auckland, shop-assistant, having been born in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, came to New Zealand on or about 9 March 1909 as an infant in arms in the charge of Marianne Caughey Preston (then Marianne Caughey Smith), above described, and her husband, William Henry Smith, of Auckland, draper:
    
    And whereas from thence onwards the said Reginald Caughey Seymour Smith was brought up in the household of the said William Henry Smith and his said wife as if he had been their son:
    
    And whereas the said Reginald Caughey Seymour Smith was not at any time legally adopted by the said William Henry Smith and/or his said wife either in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland or in New Zealand:
    
    And whereas by a certain last will and testament of the said William Henry Smith dated 24 December 1909 it was provided that in case the said Marianne Caughey Smith survived the said William Henry Smith the said Marianne Caughey Smith should take the whole of his estate, but in case the said Marianne Caughey Smith did not so survive the said William Henry Smith a bequest was made to the said Reginald Caughey Seymour Smith of 10 000 fully-paid one-pound shares of and in Smith and Caughey, Limited, if and when he attained the age of 25 years, such bequest being of a value of not less than 10,000 pounds:
    
    And whereas the said William Henry Smith died at Auckland on or about 31 August 1912 (the said Reginald Caughey Seymour Smith being then of the age of 5 or thereabouts), having previously revoked his said will and testament by a subsequent last will and testament dated 22 August 1912, by which he gave all his property to his said wife:
    
    And whereas at divers times subsequent to the death of the said William Henry Smith and before her last will and testament dated 15 February 1934 the said Marianne Caughey Smith executed several wills and testamentary documents wherein provision was made for the said Reginald Caughey Seymour Smith as follows:
        
    *   (a) by will dated 21 May 1917, 15 000 fully-paid-up shares in Smith and Caughey, Limited, were directed to be transferred to him the said Reginald Caughey Seymour Smith on his attaining the age of 25 years or previously marrying an approved person, with power (_inter alia_) to the trustees to pay to him the income meanwhile:
    
    *   (b) by will dated 10 November 1920, 15 000 fully-paid shares in Smith and Caughey, Limited, were left upon the same trusts as in the will of 21 May 1917:
    
    *   (c) by codicil dated 6 February 1924, the gift of shares in Smith and Caughey, Limited, was revoked, and in lieu thereof 15,000 pounds in cash was directed to be set apart and the income applied to the maintenance and benefit of him the said Reginald Caughey Seymour Smith during his life at the discretion, however, of the trustees, with a proviso empowering the trustees at any time after he attained the age of 25 years if he should have led an upright, diligent, and satisfactory life to pay to him the whole of such sum of 15,000 pounds or some part thereof as the trustees might think fit, the balance, if any, to form part of the residuary estate:
    
    *   (d) by will dated 10 August 1927, no provision of any kind was made for him the said Reginald Caughey Seymour Smith:
    
    *   (e) by will dated 19 April 1929, the sum of 100 pounds was directed to be set apart, with a discretionary power to apply the income therefrom for the benefit of him the said Reginald Caughey Seymour Smith during his life, with power also to the trustees to pay the said sum of 100 pounds or such part of such sum of 100 pounds as the trustees should in their discretion decide to him after attaining the age of 25 years if he had led an upright, diligent, and satisfactory life:
    
    *   (f) by will dated 12 November 1929, the conditional provision of 100 pounds made in the will of 19 April 1929 is repeated:
    
    *   (g) by codicil dated 10 November 1930, all provision for him the said Reginald Caughey Seymour Smith is revoked:
    
    *   (h) by will dated 28 November 1931, the conditional provision of 100 pounds made in the will of 19 April 1929 is repeated:
    
    *   (i) by will dated 12 September 1932, the conditional provision of 100 pounds made in the will of 19 April 1929 is repeated:
    
    And whereas on 12 September 1932, the said Marianne Caughey Smith was married to one Raymond Preston, of Auckland, minister of religion:
    
    And whereas by her last will and testament dated 15 February 1934, the said Marianne Caughey Preston directed that the sum of 100 pounds should be set apart by her trustees upon trust to pay the income therefrom for the maintenance, benefit, and advancement of the said Reginald Caughey Seymour Smith during his life, provided that when he attained the age of 25 years if the then surviving trustees should certify in writing that his life had been from her death upright, diligent, and satisfactory, then the said trustees should have power to pay to him the said Reginald Caughey Seymour Smith the whole of the said sum of 100 pounds or such part thereof as they might think fit, and no other provision was made for the said Reginald Caughey Seymour Smith:
    
    And whereas the said Reginald Caughey Seymour Smith is now of the age of almost 37 years:
    
    And whereas on 1 September 1939, the trustees of the said will certified in writing under their hands that the said Reginald Caughey Seymour Smith was then over the age of 25 years, and that since the death of the said Marianne Caughey Preston his life had been upright, diligent, and satisfactory, and thereupon paid over to him the said sum of 100 pounds pursuant to the powers given to them by the said will:
    
    And whereas the said Marianne Caughey Preston died at Auckland on 1 September 1938, without having revoked the aforementioned provisions of her said will and testament, whereof probate was granted out of the Supreme Court of New Zealand at Auckland on 28 October 1938 to John Alexander, of Auckland aforesaid, Solicitor; Samuel Little Barry, of Auckland, company secretary; Albert Bygrave Chappell, of Auckland aforesaid, minister of religion; and William James Mains, of Auckland aforesaid, warehouseman:
    
    And whereas the value of the estate of the said Marianne Caughey Preston was assessed by the Commissioner of Stamp Duties for the purposes of the duty payable under the Death Duties Act 1921 and its amendments at 467,793 pounds 1 shilling and 10 pence:
    
    And whereas the balance of residuary assets in the estate is approximately 325,000 pounds:
    
    And whereas under the terms of the said last will and testament of the said Marianne Caughey Preston the residue of her estate is held for the provision of a rest-home for aged, infirm, or impecunious women:
    
    And whereas the amount of such residue available for such purpose other than a rest-home purchased by the trustees is approximately 312,450 pounds:
    
    And whereas the said Reginald Caughey Seymour Smith, claiming to be the son of the said Marianne Caughey Preston, issued an originating summons under the Family Protection Act 1908, out of the Supreme Court of New Zealand at Auckland on 19 August 1943, whereby he sought an order making further and better provision for him out of the said estate:
    
    And whereas, after hearing in the said Supreme Court, an order was made on 17 August 1944 dismissing the said summons on the grounds that the said Reginald Caughey Seymour Smith was not the son of the said Marianne Caughey Preston:
    
    And whereas the said Supreme Court contemporaneously with the making of the said order further ordered that the trustees in the said will should be at liberty to distribute the said estate without making any provision for the said Reginald Caughey Seymour Smith:
    
    And whereas the said Reginald Caughey Seymour Smith has represented to the said trustees that it would be just and equitable for the said will to be varied by increasing the payment to him therein provided from 100 pounds to 15,000 pounds, but the said trustees have been advised that the granting of any such increased provision is a matter solely for the decision of the Legislature and have declined to express any opinion thereon:
    
    And whereas in consequence of the order made by the Supreme Court as aforesaid there is no legal power or authority for the payment referred to:
    
    And whereas such varied or increased provision cannot be made by the said trustees without Legislative authority:
    
    And whereas the objects of this Act are not attainable otherwise than by legislation.

*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][16] and [17E][17] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice.

    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
