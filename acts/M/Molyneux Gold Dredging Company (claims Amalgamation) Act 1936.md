An Act to provide for the Amalgamation of several Special Dredging Claims held under The Mining Act 1926, by the Molyneux Gold Dredging Company, Limited, and for the Protection of the Claims pending their Amalgamation.
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    WHEREAS the Molyneux Gold Dredging Company, Limited, a company incorporated in England (hereinafter referred to as the company), is the holder under The Mining Act 1926, of eight licenses, numbered respectively 1184, 1185, 1229, 1230, 1288, 1289, 1290, and 5359, for special dredging claims upon or adjacent to the Molyneux River between Cromwell and Alexandra: And whereas the company has expended large sums of money in the construction of a dredge to work the claims, but, owing to causes beyond the control of the company, it has not yet been possible to complete the dredge and place it on the river: And whereas, on account of delay in constructing the dredge and in commencing to work the claims, the licenses for some of the claims may be deemed to be abandoned by operation of law or may be liable to forfeiture in accordance with the provisions of The Mining Act 1926: And whereas it is desirable that statutory provision should be made authorizing the amalgamation of the claims notwithstanding such abandonment and liability to forfeiture, and protecting the claims pending their amalgamation:

BE IT THEREFORE ENACTED by the General Assembly of New Zealand in Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

##### 1 Short Title
    
*   This Act may be cited as The Molyneux Gold Dredging Company (Claims Amalgamation) Act 1936\.

##### 2 Authority for amalgamation of company's claims
    
*   (1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in paragraphs (b) and (d) of section one hundred and fifty-nine of The Mining Act 1926, or in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of paragraph (e) of section one hundred and fifty-six of that Act, the claims held by the company as hereinbefore recited may be amalgamated into one claim under the said section one hundred and fifty-nine without the Warden being satisfied that there has been expended in mining operations on each of the claims not less than such sum as is prescribed, and that the licenses for the claims are validly subsisting, and are neither abandoned by operation of law nor liable to forfeiture, and that no proceedings are pending in respect of such abandonment or forfeiture.
    
    (2) Except as expressly provided in this section, the provisions of The Mining Act 1926, shall, so far as they are applicable, apply with respect to any amalgamated claim granted under this section and to every application or license therefor.

##### 3 Protection of claims pending amalgamation
    
*   The licenses now held by the company as hereinbefore recited shall not be liable to forfeiture, or be deemed to be abandoned by operation of law, for any cause whatsoever (whether arising before or after the passing of this Act):
    
    Provided that the protection afforded by this section shall cease on the twenty-eighth day of February, nineteen hundred and thirty-seven, or on the date of the amalgamation of the claims, whichever date is the earlier.

##### 4 Private Act
    
*   This Act is hereby declared to be a private Act.
