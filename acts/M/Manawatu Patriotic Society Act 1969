An Act to amalgamate all the funds of the Manawatu Patriotic Society, to empower the society to sell certain land, to lend the whole or part of the proceeds of that sale to the Palmerston North Returned Services' Association (Incorporated) on the security of a second mortgage, and to provide for the dissolution of the society as from 1 January 1990 and for the vesting of its assets and funds in the Palmerston North Returned Services' Association (Incorporated) subject to certain trusts in respect thereof
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    Whereas the Manawatu Patriotic Society a body corporate at Palmerston North (hereinafter called the **society**) was incorporated pursuant to section 12 of the War Funds Act 1915 by an Order in Council dated 28 August 1916 and published in the _Gazette_ of 31 August: 
    
    And whereas the society maintains firstly an Anzac Fund comprising certain money, Government stock, and the land described in the [Schedule][12] (hereinafter called the **said land**) and secondly a Sick and Wounded Fund consisting of certain money, investments, and other assets:
    
    And whereas the assets of the said Anzac Fund represent donations for the erection and maintenance of a club building for returned servicemen: 
    
    And whereas a building was erected on the said land in 1917 and has since been used as a club by the Palmerston North Returned Services' Association (Incorporated) a duly incorporated society at Palmerston North (hereinafter called the **association**): 
    
    And whereas the Sick and Wounded Fund has been used and applied by the society in making grants and donations for relief and other charitable purposes to officers and men who enlisted in Palmerston North and the County of Kairanga and served in the 1914--1919 war and to dependants of such officers and men (hereinafter called the **said charitable purposes**):
    
    And whereas the association has now acquired premises of its own and it is considered expedient to sell the said land, but doubts have arisen as to the authority of the society to do so:
    
    And whereas for some considerable time the functions of the society have been limited to the making of grants and donations for the said charitable purposes:
    
    And whereas the society desires that all its funds be amalgamated and held by it as a war fund for the purpose of making grants and donations for the said charitable purposes: 
    
    And whereas the society further desires to lend the whole or part of the proceeds of the sale of the said land to the association on the security of a second mortgage over land owned by the association, but has no authority to do so:
    
    And whereas the society considers that by 1 January 1990 there will be few if any persons living who will then qualify for grants and donations from the funds of the society:
    
    And whereas the society proposes that it then be dissolved and its assets and funds vested in the association subject to the association for a period of 20 years thereafter continuing to make grants and donations for the said charitable purposes:
    
    And whereas the association agrees with this proposal: 
    
    And whereas effect cannot be given to the proposal unless it is implemented by legislation.

For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][14] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][15] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][16] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][17] and [17E][18] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
