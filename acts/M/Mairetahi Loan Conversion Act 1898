*   #### Preamble
    
    WHEREAS in the year one thousand eight hundred and ninety the Waitemata County Council (hereinafter called **the Council**) raised a loan of two thousand dollars for the purpose of constructing a public work in that portion of the Waitemata County specified in the Schedule hereto (hereinafter called **the Maretahi Loan District**): And whereas the Commissioners of the Public Debts Sinking Funds (hereinafter called **the Commissioners**) advanced the said money, and they are now the holders of a debenture for the same: And whereas the coupons attached to the said debenture provide for the payment of interest on the said loan at the rate of six dollars per centum per annum: And whereas the Council made provision for the repayment of the said loan by a sinking fund of four dollars per centum, and for the purpose of providing the said interest and sinking fund made a special rate of five-twelfths of a cent in the dollar upon all rateable property in the Mairetahi Loan District: And whereas the accrued interest upon the said loan and all contributions payable in respect of the said sinking fund have been paid by the Council: And whereas the Council is desirous of converting the said loan for the purpose of lessening the annual charge upon the Mairetahi Loan District:
    
    The references to ""two thousand dollars"", ""six dollars"", ""four dollars"", and ""five-twelfths of a cent in the dollar"" was substituted, as from 10 July 1967, for references to ""one thousand pounds"", ""six pounds"", ""four pounds"", and ""one penny in the pound"" pursuant to section [7(1)][10] and [(2)][10] Decimal Currency Act 1964 (1964 No 27).
