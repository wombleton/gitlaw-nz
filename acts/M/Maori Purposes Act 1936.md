*   Whereas it is proposed to erect a memorial to the late Sir James Carroll which is intended to include the construction of a Maori meeting house and other appurtenances and accessories:
    
    And whereas the Maori owners of the following lands situated in the Tairawhiti Maori Land Court District---namely, Taumata-o-teo Number 22E, Taumata-o-teo Number 24A, Taumata-o-teo Number 25B, Taumata-o-teo Number 34, Taumata-o-teo Number 35 (all which lands are hereinafter in this section referred to as the _said land_, and shall be known as the Waihirere Marae)---desire to set aside such lands as a site or sites for the purpose aforesaid and as a Maori reservation for the purposes of this section:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    (1) The court is hereby authorised and empowered to make an order vesting the said land in 2 or more trustees in trust to hold and administer the same for the purpose of this section. On the making of a vesting order or orders under this section the land affected thereby shall be deemed to be one Maori reservation within the meaning of section 298 of the principal Act, set apart and reserved for the common use of the Wairoa section of the Ngati-Kahungunu Maori Tribe, including the beneficial owners of the said land, as a meeting place, a building site, a recreation ground, or in any other manner.
    
    (2) It shall be in the power of such trustees to acquire by purchase, lease, or gift, and without confirmation under Part 13 of the principal Act, any other land which it may be thought expedient to acquire for use in conjunction with the said land, and the land when so acquired shall be deemed to be and become part of the Maori reservation created by this section, and be deemed freehold land within the meaning of the principal Act.
    
    (3) The court may from time to time make such rules as it thinks expedient for the administration and control of the Maori reservation hereby created, and for the proper use thereof, or any part thereof, by any person. Any regulation in force under section 298 of the principal Act shall not (except where such regulations are expressly made so to do) apply to the Maori reservation created under this section.
    
    (4) Notwithstanding anything in the Land Transfer Act 1915, the District Land Registrar may, without payment of fee, issue a certificate of title for the said land to the trustees appointed under this section.
    
    (5) 
        
    *   (a) For the purpose of erecting a memorial as aforesaid and accessories and appurtenances thereto on the said land for the improvement of the Maori reservation, and for the management of any gathering or ceremony taking place in connection with the memorial, including the acquisition of furniture and other chattels, there is hereby constituted a committee, to be called the Carroll Memorial Committee, consisting of the President of the Tairawhiti Maori Land Board, the East Coast Commissioner, and Te Hata Tipoki of Wairoa (or if he shall die or be incapable of acting, such other Maori of the Wairoa District as the Minister of Maori Affairs may appoint), and the said committee is hereby empowered to make all arrangements and to do all things necessary for the construction of buildings and for any other purpose specified in this paragraph. The said committee shall appoint one of its members as chairman and shall otherwise regulate its own proceedings. The committee shall continue in office until the said memorial and accessories and appurtenances thereto are completed and handed over to the trustees appointed under this section, and until the ceremony taking place in connection with the memorial is concluded.
    
    *   (b) For the purpose of making payments in connection with the construction of the memorial and the accessories and appurtenances thereto, and in connection with any ceremony taking place in regard thereto, and for any other purpose which the Carroll Memorial Committee may think expedient, the Tairawhiti District Maori Land Board shall, whenever required so to do by the committee, make payments from money in the Carroll Memorial Fund referred to in the next succeeding subsection. Any payment made by the said Board out of the Carroll Memorial Fund shall be deemed to be a proper payment if made upon the certificate of the committee. Such certificate may be given before or after the payment it refers to.
    
    (6) 
        
    *   (a) For the purpose of this section a fund is hereby established to be called the Carroll Memorial Fund (herein called the _said fund_), to be kept by the Tairawhiti Maori Land Board, and the Board may, subject to the provisions of the last preceding subsection, from time to time expend the moneys in such fund for the acquisition of land, the improvement of the Maori reservation, the erection, replacement, repair, upkeep, and insurance of buildings, the preparing and paying the upkeep of sports grounds, the expenses of any gathering or ceremony taking place in connection with the memorial, the acquisition of furniture and other chattels, and generally for any purpose in connection with or incidental to the said land as the Board may think proper. The expenditure of moneys upon the said land or any part thereof in respect of improvements, buildings, or chattels prior to the commencement of this Act shall be deemed to be expenditure duly authorised.
    
    *   (b) Any Maori Land Board or East Coast Commissioner, or any local authority, corporate body, company, trustee, or person may contribute to the said fund for the purpose of furthering the objects thereof, and any payment or contributions so made shall be deemed to be a payment lawfully made, anything in any Act to the contrary notwithstanding.
    
    *   (c) The assembled owners of any parcel of Maori land, or the committee of any land vested in the East Coast Commissioner, may pass a resolution that such sum as may be indicated shall be paid to the said fund out of any rents or other moneys which are due or accruing due or payable in the future either in 1 sum or by instalments. Any resolution heretofore passed for the purpose set forth in this section shall enure for the purposes of this Act as if it had originated under this section, and shall be deemed to have so originated.
    
    *   (d) It shall be lawful for a Maori Land Board, the MƒÅori Trustee, or the East Coast Commissioner to make advances out of their respective accounts of the whole or any part of the amounts directed by any resolution passed under the last preceding paragraph in anticipation of the rents or other moneys to become due or payable, and to charge the money so advanced against the land affected. In the case of a Maori Land Board a memorandum of charge may be executed under section 109 of the principal Act.
    
    (7) When the Carroll Memorial Committee has fulfilled the purposes for which it was constituted the provisions of subsection (5) shall cease to operate, and thereafter all payments out of the said fund shall be made as the regulations prescribe, or, if there are no regulations, on the certificate of 2 or more of the trustees as the court may authorise. The Tairawhiti Maori Land Board shall not be bound to pay any amount so certified by the trustees, but if any dispute shall arise between the Board and the trustees the matter shall be referred to the Minister of Maori Affairs, whose decision shall be final and shall be acted upon accordingly.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Maori Purposes Act 1936\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 July 2003, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][37] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][38] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][1] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][39] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][1] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][40] and [17E][41] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][1] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][1] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   ‚Ä¢omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   ‚Ä¢typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   ‚Ä¢layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   ‚Ä¢indentation
        *   ‚Ä¢position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   ‚Ä¢format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   ‚Ä¢format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   ‚Ä¢position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   ‚Ä¢punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   ‚Ä¢Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   ‚Ä¢case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   ‚Ä¢format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   ‚Ä¢small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   ‚Ä¢schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   ‚Ä¢running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   ‚Ä¢format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
