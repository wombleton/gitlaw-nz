An Act to vary the terms of certain trusts created by the will of the late James Tannock Mackelvie, of the County of Middlesex in England, Esquire
    
*   Whereas James Tannock Mackelvie, late of the County of Middlesex in England, Esquire (hereinafter called the **testator**), by his last will and testament bequeathed all the pictures, prints, bronzes, statues, vases, works of art, articles of vertu, and curiosities which should belong to him at the time of his death (hereinafter called the **said collection**) to his New Zealand trustees (hereinafter called the **trustees**), and also directed that certain moneys should be paid to or received by the trustees:
    
    And whereas the testator by his said will declared that the trustees should stand possessed of the said collection and moneys upon trust, inter alia, to purchase or acquire a site in or near the City of Auckland and cause to be erected thereon a museum capable to receive and display the said collection and any additions that might be made to the same and to place therein the said collection and to hold the said museum and the contents thereof as a free public museum of art forever and to allow the said museum to be visited at all suitable times on Sundays as well as weekdays by all decent and orderly persons without payment or exceptional privilege, and that after paying the cost of erecting and fitting the said museum and setting apart certain sums as in the said will directed to provide for the payment of the salary or salaries of 1 or more competent custodians and the cost of keeping the said museum in repair and of insuring the same and the contents thereof upon trust to lay out the surplus of the trust moneys in the hands of the trustees in the purchase, transport, and arrangement of other works of art of any kind or objects of curious or antiquarian interest connected with art to be added to and held and exhibited with the said collection and to fit and appropriate a portion of the said museum as a public library of art and to lay out in purchasing books, instructive, historical, or curious in matters of art, any moneys which might be laid out in adding to the said collection:
    
    And whereas it proved impracticable for the trustees, having regard to the moneys available to the trustees, to purchase a site and erect a museum thereon:
    
    And whereas in the year 1892 the body corporate called the Mayor, Councillors, and Citizens of the City of Auckland (hereinafter called the **Corporation**) made available to the trustees a building erected as an annex to the Auckland Art Gallery, and such annex together with additions thereto were used for many years exclusively for the safe custody and exhibition of the said collection and additions made thereto (hereinafter together called the **Mackelvie collection**):
    
    And whereas the trustees on 3 March 1913 were incorporated under the provisions of the Religious, Charitable, and Educational Trusts Act 1908 under the name of the Mackelvie Trust Board (hereinafter called the **Board**): 
    
    And whereas the arrangements between the trustees and the Corporation and the Board and the Corporation regarding the deposit and exhibition of the Mackelvie collection in the said buildings hereinbefore referred to were set forth in a deed bearing date 29 September 1892 and subsequently in a deed bearing date 30 May 1922:
    
    And whereas the first of such deeds was entered into subsequent to the approval of a scheme by the Supreme Court of New Zealand on 16 September 1892 and the second of such deeds was sanctioned and approved by the Supreme Court aforesaid on 2 August 1922:
    
    And whereas in the year 1954 the Corporation informed the Board that it would no longer be able to keep the said buildings available for the safe custody and exhibition of the Mackelvie collection exclusively: 
    
    And whereas in the opinion of the Board it still is and may for many years remain impracticable for the Board to purchase or acquire a site and erect thereon a museum of art and it is the desire of the Board to obtain by legislation wide powers whereby the Board may be enabled to make the best possible use of the Mackelvie collection:
    
    And whereas in or about the year 1911 an appointment was made of the Mayor of Auckland for the time being to be _ex officio_ one of the trustees:
    
    And whereas by letter dated 19 May 1954 the then Mayor of Auckland resigned office as a member of the Board and doubts have arisen as to the effect of such resignation: 
    
    And whereas it is desirable to remove such doubts and to make provision for the appointment from time to time by the Auckland City Council of a member of the Board.

##### 2 Interpretation
    
*   In this Act, if not inconsistent with the context,---

    _will_ means the said will of James Tannock Mackelvie.

##### 3 Empowering as to custody of Mackelvie collection
    
*   The Board, instead of acquiring a site by purchase and erecting a building for a museum of art, as in the will directed, may make such arrangements as it thinks fit for the custody of the Mackelvie collection in any building or buildings in or near the City of Auckland which may from time to time be available and in the opinion of the Board suitable for the custody thereof.

##### 4 Empowering as to exhibition in or near the City of Auckland
    
*   The Board shall have power from time to time to make such arrangements as it thinks fit for the exhibition at any place or places in or near the City of Auckland of the Mackelvie collection or any parts thereof, whether or not such exhibition takes place under the control of the Board or under the control of the Corporation or under the control of any other person, persons, association, society, or body corporate and whether the same be an exhibition of the Mackelvie collection or any part thereof as a separate unit or whether the same be integrated at such exhibition with any works of art not forming part of the Mackelvie collection.

##### 5 Empowering as to exhibition elsewhere

Any such arrangements may be for the exhibition of such parts of the Mackelvie collection as aforesaid by or under the control of the Board or by or under the control of any other person or persons, association, society, or body corporate and whether the same be an exhibition of the Mackelvie collection or any part thereof as a separate unit or whether the same be integrated at such exhibition with any works of art not forming part of the Mackelvie collection.

##### 6 Empowering when charges made for admission
    
*   The Board may permit the exhibition of any part or parts of the Mackelvie collection under circumstances where a charge is made for admission, but this power shall not be exercised by the Board unless---
        
    *   (a) in the opinion of at least three-fourths of the members of the Board for the time being in New Zealand it is desirable so to do; and
    
    *   (b) in the case of an exhibition in or near the City of Auckland of a part of the Mackelvie collection which in the opinion of the Board is a substantial part, the Board is satisfied that there will at the same time be exhibited in or near the City of Auckland some other substantial part of the Mackelvie collection without any charge being made for admission.

In addition the Board shall have power to vary or transpose any investments for the time being forming part of Fund A or Fund B respectively into or for other investments of any nature hereby authorised in respect of each such fund. The Board shall be under no obligation to maintain Fund A and Fund B at equal values.
    
    (3) No investment shall be made in stock, shares, or debentures of any company unless such investment shall have been approved in writing by the manager for the time being at Auckland of the bank which is for the time being the banker of the Board, and also by a person authorised to undertake trading activities on a registered exchange's securities market (within the meaning of [section 2(1)][19] of the Securities Markets Act 1988).

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Mackelvie Trust Act 1958\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 24 November 2009, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][23] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][24] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][25] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][26] and [17E][27] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
