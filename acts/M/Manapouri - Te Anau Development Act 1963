(f)The amount debited to Capital Account No. 2, pursuant to paragraph (b) of clause 6 hereof, shall be apportioned between the items within Capital Account No. 2 so that the proportion debited in respect of an item bears the same proportion to that amount as the total of the amounts debited by balance day, and estimated to be debited between balance day and apportionment day, in respect of the item, pursuant to paragraph (a) of clause 6 hereof, bears to the total of the amounts debited by balance day, and estimated to be debited between balance day and apportionment day, to Capital Account No. 2 pursuant to the said paragraph (a).

(b)The depreciation account referred to in paragraph (a) of this clause is one which would have been established and maintained as follows item by item in respect of all items in respect of which a debit is at any time made to Capital Account No. 1 or Capital Account No. 2 or Capital Account No. 3 or Capital Account No. 4:---

(i)the account would have been credited with interest at the rate of 5% (compounded annually) on all amounts credited thereto under subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) of this paragraph;

(ii)the account would have been credited annually commencing at the end of the year following the construction period with such equal amounts as would be necessary having regard to the said interest to provide at the end of the depreciation period an amount equal to the total amount debited to Capital Account No. 1 or Capital Account No. 2 or Capital Account No. 3 or Capital Account No. 4 in respect of the item;

(iii)the account would have been credited with the amounts and the value of other considerations obtained by the Crown from time to time from the sale or disposal of any item or any part thereof as and when received by the Crown.

(ii)for electrical power made available in pursuance of notices given by the company under the said paragraph (g), an amount equal to the product of the yearly kilowatt price multiplied by the number of kilowatts which bears the same proportion to 200,000 as the quantity of energy available during that quarter (on the basis of the load factor of the electrical power required under the said notices) from the electrical power so made available, and for which the company is obliged to pay under the terms of the agreement during that quarter, bears to the quantity of energy available from two Crown blocks during the calendar year in which that quarter occurs.

(c)The Crown shall render an account to the company for the amount payable for electrical power under the agreement at the beginning of each calendar quarter in respect of the preceding quarter, and each account shall be payable within one month after it is received by the company at its office at Bluff, or elsewhere as may be agreed, at the New Zealand Electricity Department's office at Dunedin, or by lodgement to the Public Account at any branch in New Zealand of the Bank of New Zealand, followed by mailing of the bank's receipt for the amount so lodged to the said Department's office.

(d)In any case where immediately after the end of a particular quarter it is not possible to calculate accurately the yearly kilowatt price or the number of notified kilowatts because some or all of the components of either or both of them are not then known, a _pro forma_ account shall be rendered in respect of that quarter with either or both (as the case may be) the yearly kilowatt price and number of notified kilowatts estimated as accurately as is then possible, and the amount of the _pro forma_ account shall be adjusted in the quarterly account next after all components are known. In the event of it being necessary to estimate the number of notified kilowatts because the exact number in any block of electrical power required by the company under a notice given pursuant to clause 5 of the agreement has not at the time been determined under clause 8 of the agreement, then the number of notified kilowatts in that block shall, for the purpose of the _pro forma_ account, be estimated as the number of kilowatts required by that notice.

My dear Minister,

We have been advised that, under existing conditions, certain low-lying areas of Te Anau township are subject to flooding, to becoming swampy and to carrying surface water. We understand that the Ministry of Works estimates at approximately £100,000 the cost of raising these areas, and the improvements on them, to a height which would leave them clear of water when the lake is at the level of the datum point proposed to be fixed under the agreement (20 feet on the lake gauge).

It has already been indicated to you that, when our studies are complete, it may be found to be practicable for the maximum level of Lake Te Anau to be fixed at a lower point than this datum. If this should prove to be the case, it is assumed that the amount of work required, and hence the cost of raising these areas above water level would be reduced if not eliminated.

We are pleased to confirm that when embarking on Stage II of the power development, we will accept as ""rights acquired"" under clause 7 of the agreement, and accordingly will meet the cost of, any work necessary to raise these areas, and the presently existing improvements to a height which will leave them clear of water when the lake rises to the maximum level then permitted under the agreement.

Yours faithfully,

My Dear Minister,

#### Manapouri - Te Anau Project Lake Levels

Under the terms of the Agreement relating to the above project it is theoretically permissible for us to operate the lake system in a manner which would cause the level of Lake Manapouri to vary from almost the maximum level of Lake Te Anau to the minimum natural level determined in accordance with clause 6(d).

We wish to confirm our assurance that we have no intention of operating the system in this manner, and indeed it would be quite contrary to our interests to do so. We are quite willing that the terms of the Agreement should be amended so as to define appropriately the range within which Lake Manapouri is to be maintained after its level has been raised as the result of any works we may construct after Stage I of this project.

At the present stage of the investigation it is not known to what height Manapouri will be raised, and it is therefore not possible to fix a new minimum level to replace the ""minimum natural level"" fixed under clause 6(d). Moreover it is expected that the need for this new level will not be reached for a considerable number of years.

In these circumstances we would suggest that the Company for its part and you as Minister on behalf of the Government now place on record our mutual agreement, as soon as sufficient facts are known to enable this to be done, and in any event before the Company proceeds beyond Stage I, to vary the Agreement in accordance with the principles set out under the following paragraphs of this letter, and to effect that variation formally in accordance with clause 25 of the Agreement.

In these circumstances, we would suggest that we should place on record now our mutual intention to amend the Agreement when sufficient facts are known, in accordance with the following principles:---
    
*   (1) The Company's right to raise the level of Lake Manapouri will remain limited to the datum level fixed under clause 6(c) of the Agreement, and will be further limited under normal conditions to a new operating level to be determined;

*   (2) the Company shall use its best endeavours to prevent the lake rising above this new level, and in the event that abnormal conditions cause such a rise, it will so operate its works as to reduce the lake to the new level as rapidly as is practicable;

*   (3) the Company's right to lower the level of Lake Manapouri shall be limited to a new level to be nominated by the Company at not more than 27½ feet below the new level determined under paragraph (1);

*   (4) in emergency conditions the proviso to clause 6(d) shall however continue to apply, but in relation to the new level fixed under paragraph (3).

It is not intended that the Company's right to raise Lake Manapouri by stages shall be in any way affected, and hence if this is decided upon, it will be necessary for new levels to be fixed as above in relation to each stage.

We also agree further study may indicate that it will be practicable to obtain more economic regulation of Lake Te Anau by making provision to draw the lake down below the ""minimum natural level"". This could permit a reduction of the datum level as defined in clause 6(c) of the Agreement. It could also reduce the draw-down on Manapouri in unusually dry seasons. It is possible therefore that we may propose that the amendment to the Agreement should cover this aspect also, and we seek your agreement in principle to such a proposal.

Yours faithfully,

Dear Sir,

I write to advise you in respect of certain levels and of scenery protection requirements as provided for in the Manapouri - Te Anau Agreement.
    
*   1\. _Lake Levels._
    
    In respect of clause 6c, the datum level is defined as R.L. 676.6 feet.
    
    In respect of clause 6d, I advise that the lowest natural levels have been determined by survey as:---
        
    *   for Lake Te Anau -- 656.6 feet
    
    *   for Lake Manapouri -- 575.5 feet
    
    All these levels are in terms of mean sea level at Deep Cove.

*   2\. The requirements in relation to preservation of scenic qualities (clause 22) are as follows:---
        
    *   (1) The following expressions are used below with respect to Lake Manapouri with the following meanings:--- 
            
        *   (a) ""lowest operating level"":---the lowest level to which the Company may lower the lake without obtaining the consent of the Minister.
        
        *   (b) ""highest retention level"":---the new operating level to be fixed as set out in the Company's letter of 12 April 1961\.
        
        *   (c) ""lower level"":---a level which, for navigational and scenic reasons, is set 5 feet below the lowest operating level.
        
        *   (d) ""upper level"":---a level which, to allow for the effects on vegetation, is set three feet above the highest retention level.
        
        
    
    *   (2) Trees which will be completely below the lower level of Lake Manapouri may be left untouched except that approach channels with a clear depth of 10 feet shall be cleared to all jetties constructed by the Company.
    
    *   (3) Trees growing below the lower level of Lake Manapouri but projecting above it shall be topped at or below that level.
    
    *   (4) Between the lower level and the highest retention level of Lake Manapouri---
            
        *   (a) where slopes are generally less than 1 in 7 or are otherwise accessible for mechanical clearing, all trees, stumps and scrub shall be cleared and either burnt to ashes or removed.
        
        *   (b) Where clearance by mechanical means is impracticable all trees and scrub shall be cut close to ground level and together with stumps exceeding 24 inches in diameter shall be burnt to ashes or removed.
        
        *   (c) Where the slopes are generally steep, i.e. of the order of 1 to 1½ (say 35°) or greater, no treatment is required until the effect of raising the lake level has been observed over a period of up to three years, when fallen trees, scrub and remaining trees shall be dealt with as provided in subparagraph (b).
        
        
    
    *   (5) Between the highest retention level and the upper level of Lake Manapouri all dead and dying scrub and trees shall be removed, but the Company may if it so elects treat any part of this zone in the manner provided in paragraph 4\.
    
    (6)(a)The following expressions are used in this letter with respect to Lake Te Anau with the following meanings:---
    
    (i)""maximum control level""---the highest level to which the lake is to be permitted to rise under controlled conditions,
    
    (ii)""upper level""---a level three feet above the maximum control level.
    
    (b)On completion of any works by means of which the level of Lake Te Anau may be controlled the Company shall notify the Minister of the maximum control level, and thereafter shall notify the Minister forthwith if any change is made in the maximum control level.
    
    (c)Whenever the lake rises above the maximum control level, the Company shall so operate its works as to reduce the lake to that level as rapidly as practicable and shall use its best endeavours to prevent such a rise.
    
    (d)Below the upper level of Lake Te Anau all dead and dying scrub and trees shall be removed, but the Company may, if it so elects, treat any part of this zone in the manner provided in para. 4\.
    
    *   (7) Where an existing jetty, or hut is inundated a new jetty or hut as the case may be, of similar standard and capacity, shall be constructed in an appropriate location as near as may to that of the original location, in consultation with the Fiordland Park Board.
    
    *   (8) Attractive picnic places will be provided for the public around the shores of the lakes at sites selected in consultation with the Fiordland Park Board. This is in accordance with the Company's offer which is appreciated.
    
    *   (9) Where there exist areas which will, when the level of Lake Manapouri lies between the lowest operating and highest retention levels, be more than 2 chains from the lake shoreline (including island shorelines) and over which there may be less than 10 clear feet of water, these areas shall be either marked by beacons, indicated by notices or shown on a published chart of the lake, as may be agreed in each case between the Company and the Minister.
    
    *   (10) At each jetty or wharf constructed by the Company there shall be erected fixed gauge boards so marked as to show the level of Lake Manapouri in relation to the lowest operating level.
    
    *   (11) In relation to any stage of development the action to be taken by the Company pursuant to these requirements shall be completed within a period of 5 years after the date on which the lake first reaches the highest retention level or maximum control level as the case may be.
    
    *   (12) On completion to his satisfaction of the necessary work in relation to any stage of development the Minister will give to the Company a certificate of completion and thereafter the Company shall have no further responsibility pursuant to these requirements in relation to that change.
    
    *   (13) In the course of our discussions, the Company offered to make available to the Fiordland Park Board the sum of £5,000 a year for a period of 5 years after the grant of the certificate of completion relating to the Stage II of the project so that the Board may carry out such maintenance and further work as it considers desirable. This offer is a generous one, which it is felt will be welcomed by the Board.
    
    

*   3\. I refer now to your letter of 12 April in which you confirmed on behalf of your Company your willingness to meet the cost of any work necessary to raise the lowlying areas of Te Anau when embarking on Stage II of the power development.
    
    Your offer is gladly accepted by the Government in the terms set out in your letter.

*   4\. Your further letter of 12 April which discussed the matter of the operating range in Lake Manapouri is acknowledged. Your proposals set out therein are generally acceptable and will be the subject of a further letter within the next few days.

*   5\. I take this opportunity of expressing the goodwill of the Government towards you and your partners in the development of these resources.

Yours faithfully,

Dear Sir,

I now write further in respect of your letter of 12 April which discussed the proposed amendment to the Agreement in respect of the operating range in Lake Manapouri.

That letter has already been acknowledged and generally accepted in my advice to you of 26 April 1961\.

Your letter has been carefully considered by Cabinet. Government is pleased to receive the confirmation of your assurance that your Company has no intention of operating the lake system in a manner which would cause the level of Lake Manapouri to vary from almost the maximum level of Lake Te Anau to the minimum natural level determined in accordance with clause 6(d) of the Agreement. Government is appreciative of the Company's willingness to amend the Agreement so as to define appropriately the range within which Lake Manapouri is to be maintained after its level has been raised as the result of any works the Company may construct after Stage I of the Manapouri development, and on behalf of the Government I am pleased to confirm our mutual agreement with the Company as soon as sufficient facts are known to enable it to be done, and in any event before the Company proceeds beyond Stage I to vary the Agreement in accordance with the principles set out in your letter, namely:---
    
*   "(1) The Company's right to raise the level of Lake Manapouri will remain limited to the datum level fixed under clause 6(c) of the Agreement, and will be further limited under normal conditions to a new operating level to be determined;

*   (2) The Company shall use its best endeavours to prevent the lake rising above this new level, and in the event that abnormal conditions cause such a rise, it will so operate its works as to reduce the lake to the new level as rapidly as is practicable;

*   (3) The Company's right to lower the level of Lake Manapouri shall be limited to a new level to be nominated by the Company at not more than 27½ feet below the new level determined under paragraph (1);

*   (4) In emergency conditions the proviso to clause 6(d) shall however continue to apply, but in relation to the new level fixed under paragraph (3).

It is not intended that the Company's right to raise Lake Manapouri by stages shall be in any way affected, and hence if this is decided upon, it will be necessary for new levels to be fixed as above in relation to each stage."

The Government appreciates that in the planning of the project for stage development, the Company would have the right to nominate the new upper level as well as the new lower level, always provided that those levels are within the limits set by the Te Anau datum level and the maximum range of 27½ feet.

With reference to the last paragraph of your letter, Government is interested in, and agrees in principle with, the desirability of investigating the practicability of making provision for Lake Te Anau to be drawn down below the ""minimum natural level""; and I look forward to your further advice in this regard.

I take this opportunity of expressing the Government's appreciation of the Company's helpful attitude as expressed in the letter under reply.

Yours faithfully,

Dear Sir,

Will you please refer to my letter of 26 April 1961 which defines certain levels and advises the Government requirements in respect of preservation of scenic qualities.

In that letter the last word of paragraph 2.12 should be ""stage"" not ""change""; moreover the following words should be added to that paragraph following the word ""stage"":---
    
*   ""except to the extent that at any time thereafter damage may be caused to vegetation as the result of the Company's negligence in the operation of its works"".

I would be grateful if you would note the above modifications.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Manapouri - Te Anau Development Act 1963\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 30 June 2012, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][24] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][25] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][26] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][27] and [17E][28] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
