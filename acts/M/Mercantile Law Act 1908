#### Dispositions by mercantile agents

##### 3 Powers of mercantile agent with respect to disposition of goods
    
*   (1) Where a mercantile agent is, with the consent of the owner, in possession of goods or of the documents of title to goods, any sale, pledge, or other disposition of the goods made by him when acting in the ordinary course of business of a mercantile agent shall, subject to the provisions of this Part of this Act, be as valid as if he were expressly authorised by the owner of the goods to make the same; provided that the person taking under the disposition acts in good faith, and has not at the time of the disposition notice that the person making the disposition has no authority to make the same.
    
    (1A) Where a mercantile agent is, with the consent of the owner, in possession of goods, or documents of title to the goods, that are subject to a perfected security interest under the [Personal Property Securities Act 1999][57], the person taking under any disposition of the goods is deemed to have notice that the person making the disposition has no authority to make it, unless it is proved that the authority did exist.
    
    (2) Where a mercantile agent has, with the consent of the owner, been in possession of goods or of the documents of title to goods, any sale, pledge, or other disposition which would have been valid if the consent had continued shall be valid notwithstanding the determination of the consent, provided that the person taking under the disposition has not at the time thereof notice that the consent has been determined.
    
    (3) Where a mercantile agent has obtained possession of any documents of title to goods by reason of his being or having been, with the consent of the owner, in possession of the goods represented thereby, or of any other documents of title to the goods, his possession of the first-mentioned documents shall, for the purposes of this Part of this Act, be deemed to be with the consent of the owner.
    
    (4) For the purposes of this Part of this Act the consent of the owner shall be presumed in the absence of evidence to the contrary.
    
    Compare: 1890 No 11 s 4; Factors Act 1889, s 2 (UK)
    
    Subsection (1A) was inserted, as from 1 April 1990, by section 67 Motor Vehicle Securities Act 1989 (1989 No 14).
    
    Subsection (1A) was substituted, as from 1 May 2002, by section [191(1)][58] Personal Property Securities Act 1999 (1999 No 126). _See_ also Part [12][59] of that Act for transitional provisions.

##### 4 Effect of pledges of documents of title
    
*   A pledge of the documents of title to goods shall be deemed to be a pledge of the goods.
    
    Compare: 1890 No 11 s 5; Factors Act 1889, s 3 (UK)

##### 5 Pledge for antecedent debt
    
*   Where a mercantile agent pledges goods as security for a debt or liability due from the pledgor to the pledgee before the time of the pledge, the pledgee shall acquire no further right to the goods than could have been enforced by the pledgor at the time of the pledge.
    
    Compare: 1890 No 11 s 6; Factors Act 1889, s 4 (UK)

##### 6 Rights acquired by exchange of goods or documents
    
*   The consideration necessary for the validity of a sale, pledge, or other disposition of goods in pursuance of this Part of this Act may be either a payment in cash, or the delivery or transfer of other goods, or of a document of title to goods, or of a negotiable security, or any other valuable consideration; but where goods are pledged by a mercantile agent in consideration of the delivery or transfer of other goods, or of a document of title to goods, or of a negotiable security, the pledgee shall acquire no right or interest in the goods so pledged in excess of the value of the goods, documents, or security when so delivered or transferred in exchange.
    
    Compare: 1890 No 11 s 7; Factors Act 1889, s 5 (UK)

##### 7 Agreements through clerks, etc

    Compare: 1890 No 11 s 8; Factors Act 1889, s 6 (UK)

##### 8 Provisions as to consignors and consignees
    
*   (1) Where the owner of goods has given possession of the goods to another person for the purpose of consignment or sale, or has shipped the goods in the name of another person, and the consignee of the goods has not had notice that such person is not the owner of the goods, the consignee shall, in respect of advances made to or for the use of such person, have the same lien on the goods as if such person were the owner of the goods, and may transfer any such lien to another person.
    
    (2) Nothing in this section shall limit or affect the validity of any sale, pledge, or disposition by a mercantile agent.
    
    Compare: 1890 No 11 s 9; Factors Act 1889, s 7 (UK)

##### 9 Effect of transfer of document of title to goods on vendor's lien, and right of stoppage _in transitu_
    
*   Where a document of title to goods has been lawfully transferred to a person as a buyer or owner of the goods, and that person transfers the document to a person who takes the document in good faith and for valuable consideration, the last-mentioned transfer shall have the same effect for defeating any vendor's lien or right of stoppage _in transitu_ as the transfer of a bill of lading has for defeating the right of stoppage _in transitu_:
    
    Provided that this section shall be construed subject to section [48][60] of the [Sale of Goods Act 1908][61].
    
    Compare: 1890 No 11 s 12; Factors Act 1889, s 10 (UK)

    *   (d) Prevent the owner of goods sold by a mercantile agent from recovering from the buyer the price agreed to be paid for the same, or any part of that price, subject to any right of set-off on the part of the buyer against such agent.

    and a person shall be regarded for the purposes of this Act as having become the lawful holder of the bill of lading whenever that person has become the holder of the bill in good faith.
    
    (3) References in this Part of this Act to a person's being identified in a document include references to that person being identified by a description which allows for the identity of that person to be varied, in accordance with the terms of the document, after its issue; and the reference in section [13A(3)(b)][18] of this Part of this Act to a document identifying a person shall be construed accordingly.

    *   (a) The lawful holder of a bill of lading; or

    (2) Where a person becomes the lawful holder of a bill of lading when possession of the bill no longer gives a right (as against the carrier) to possession of the goods to which the bill relates, that person shall not have any rights transferred to him or her by virtue of subsection [(1)][19] of this section unless that person becomes the holder of the bill---
        
    *   (a) By virtue of a transaction effected in pursuance of any contractual or other arrangements made before the time when such a right to possession ceased to attach to possession of the bill; or

    *   (a) A person with any interest or right in or in relation to goods to which the document relates sustains loss or damage in consequence of a breach of the contract of carriage; but
    
    *   (b) Subsection [(1)][19] of this section operates in relation to that document so that rights of suit in respect of that breach are vested in another person,---
    
    the other person shall be entitled to exercise those rights for the benefit of the person who sustained the loss or damage to the same extent as they could have been exercised if they had been vested in the person for whose benefit they are exercised.
    
    (5) Where rights are transferred by virtue of the operation of subsection [(1)][19] of this section in relation to any document, the transfer for which that subsection provides shall extinguish any entitlement to those rights that derives,---

    *   (b) In the case of any document to which this Act applies from the previous operation of that subsection in relation to that document;---
