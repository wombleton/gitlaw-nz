    *   (b) the licence is liable to forfeiture under paragraph (e) of section 190 of the Mining Act 1926 or has been abandoned within the meaning of paragraph (e) of section 194 of that Act:
    
    *   (c) any person, other than the registered licensee or a tenant of the registered licensee or a person occupying the same with the consent of the registered licensee, is in occupation of the land comprised in the licence or of any part of that land.

    *   (b) it is not liable to forfeiture and has not been abandoned as aforesaid; and
    
    *   (c) no person, other than the registered licensee or a tenant of the registered licensee or a person occupying the same with the consent of the registered licensee, is in occupation of the land comprised in the licence or of any part of that land,---

    (3) Where on any such inquiry the Mining Registrar is satisfied that the licence is current at the time of the inquiry but is liable to forfeiture or has been abandoned as aforesaid and that no person, other than the registered licensee or a tenant of the registered licensee or a person occupying the same with the consent of the registered licensee, is in occupation of the land comprised in the licence or of any part of that land, the Registrar shall apply to the Warden under the Mining Act 1926 for a decree of forfeiture or a certificate of abandonment, as the case may be, in respect of the licence. Where the Warden refuses to grant such a decree or certificate, then, subject to the provisions of [section 5][6], the Mining Registrar shall issue in respect of the licence a certificate in the form in [Schedule 1][29].
    
    (4) Where under subsection (3) the Warden grants a decree of forfeiture or a certificate of abandonment with respect to any licence, the Mining Registrar shall give notice in writing thereof to the Commissioner of Crown Lands.

##### 4 Land occupied by person other than registered licensee
    
*   (1) Where on any inquiry under [section 3][4] the Mining Registrar is satisfied with respect to any licence that at the time of the inquiry---
        
    *   (a) it is current; and
    
    *   (b) it is not liable to forfeiture under paragraph (e) of section 190 of the Mining Act 1926 and has not been abandoned within the meaning of paragraph (e) of section 194 of that Act; and

    *   (d) confirming the title of the registered licensee to the licence; or

    *   (g) cancelling the licence.
    
    (2) On any application under subsection (1), the Warden may make any order specified in paragraphs (d) to (g) of that subsection or such other order as he considers just and equitable in the circumstances of the case.

    provided that the term of every renewal to which the licensee is entitled under the new licence shall be the same as the term of every renewal to which the licensee under the cancelled licence was entitled.
    
    (4) A new licence may be granted under the provisions of subsection (2), notwithstanding anything in section 6 of the Mining Amendment Act 1953 or in section 2 of the Mining Amendment Act 1961\.

    *   (b) in the case of a licence of other land, be served by the Mining Registrar on the person in occupation of the land or of any part thereof and also on such other persons and in such manner as the Warden directs.
    
    (6) Without limiting the powers of the Warden to make any order under subsection (2), the Warden may under that subsection grant a new licence to any person occupying the whole or part of the land comprised in an existing licence, if he is satisfied that---

    *   (b) the occupier had been in possession of the land comprised in the licence, or part of that land, as the case may be, for a period of not less than 12 years and that his possession had been adverse to the title of the registered licensee; or

    (7) On any application to the Warden under subsection (1), the Warden may receive as evidence any statement, document, information, or matter that may in his opinion assist him to deal effectually with the application, whether or not the same would be otherwise admissible in a court of law.

    (12) Where a new licence is issued under this section to the licensee under a former licence or to an equitable owner of a former licence, the licence (whether it is in respect of the whole or part of the land in the former licence) shall be deemed to be subject to all registered encumbrances, liens, and other interests to which the former licence was subject at the date of the granting of the new licence, and for the unexpired term of the former licence shall be entitled to the benefit of all interests to which the former licence was entitled at that date, and all such encumbrances, liens, and other interests shall be preserved in the order of their existing priority.
    
    (13) Where a new licence is issued under this section to a person other than the licensee under a former licence or an equitable owner of a former licence, the new licence (whether it is in respect of the whole or part of the land in the former licence) shall be subject to such (if any) of the registered encumbrances, liens, and interests to which the former licence was subject at the date of the granting of the new licence as are specified in the order granting the new licence, and for the unexpired term of the former licence shall be entitled to the benefit of all interests to which the former licence was entitled at that date, and all such encumbrances, liens, and other interests shall be preserved in the order of their existing priority.
    
    Section 4(11): amended, on 1 April 1978, by section 23 of the Ministry of Energy Act 1977 (1977 No 33).

##### 5 Description of land and diagrams
    
*   (1) Before the Mining Registrar issues a certificate in the form in [Schedule 1][29] with respect to any licence, the Chief Surveyor of the land district in which the land comprised in the licence is situated shall make such investigations as he thinks necessary for the purpose of determining whether or not in his opinion the description of the land comprised in the licence and any diagram of the land endorsed on or attached to the original licence or duplicate original licence or certified copy licence, as the case may be, registered in the office of the Mining Registrar are reasonably sufficient to identify the land.
    
    (2) Where the Chief Surveyor is satisfied that the description and diagram as aforesaid are reasonably sufficient to identify the land, he shall endorse on or attach to the original licence or duplicate original licence or certified copy licence, as the case may be, registered in the office of the Mining Registrar, so as to be identifiable therewith, a certificate to that effect.
    
    (3) Where the Chief Surveyor is not so satisfied, he shall prepare and endorse on or attach to the original licence or duplicate original licence or certified copy licence, as the case may be, registered in the office of the Mining Registrar a description of the land or a diagram thereof, or both, reasonably sufficient in his opinion to identify the land, together with a certificate that the description and diagram are reasonably sufficient to identify the land.
    
    (4) For the purposes of this section, the Chief Surveyor may, by notice in writing served on the licensee, call upon him to produce for inspection by the Chief Surveyor any plan, search notes, or other document in his possession or under his control evidencing or tending to evidence in any manner the description, boundaries, extent, or position of the land comprised in the licence.
    
    (5) Subject to the provisions of [sections 10][11] and [22][23], the description and diagram of the land comprised in any licence as certified by the Chief Surveyor under this section shall for the purposes of this Act and the [Land Transfer Act 1952][36] be deemed to be the correct description of the land for which the licence was granted.

    (2) The Mining Registrar may make a copy of any such document or plan or diagram and certify it as being a true copy thereof.
    
    (3) The Mining Registrar may require any person of any of the classes hereinafter mentioned to give any information, explanation, or evidence, in writing upon oath or otherwise, concerning the licence or instrument, or to attend at the time specified in the notice at the office of the Mining Registrar nearest to the place where that person resides, and give to the Mining Registrar that information, explanation, or evidence orally upon oath or otherwise.

    the Mining Registrar shall serve notice on the person appearing to him to be the licensee requiring him within 3 months after service on him of the notice to apply to the Warden for the grant of a licence of the land comprised in the original licence, and advising him that if he fails to do so the licence will be cancelled at the expiration of that period.

    provided that the term of every renewal to which the licensee is entitled under the new licence shall be the same as the term of every renewal to which the licensee under the original licence was entitled.
    
    (3) Subject to the provisions of subsection (2), if no such application is made within the said period of 3 months, the licence shall be deemed to be cancelled at the expiration of that period, and the Mining Registrar shall make an entry in his register that the licence has been cancelled under this subsection:
    
    provided that, if under subsection (2) the Warden extends the time within which an application may be made under that subsection, the licence shall thereupon be deemed to be revived.
    
    (4) If on any such application the Warden refuses to grant a new licence, the original licence shall thereupon be deemed to be cancelled. The Registrar of the Warden's Court shall notify the Mining Registrar of the refusal of the Warden to grant a new licence, and the Mining Registrar shall make an entry in his register that the licence has been cancelled under this subsection.

Where as a result of the decision of the Warden or, as the case may be, the decision on appeal a new licence is to be granted to the applicant, that licence shall be for the same term as the renewal term provided in the expired licence and at the same rent and otherwise on the same conditions as the expired licence.

    provided that, where any such document is also a grant of a mining privilege that is not a licence within the meaning of this Act or is also a disposition of or dealing with any such mining privilege, the Mining Registrar, instead of forwarding to the District Land Registrar the document filed in the office of the Mining Registrar, shall forward a copy thereof certified by him to be a true copy.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Mining Tenures Registration Act 1962\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 July 2013, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][57] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][58] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][59] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][60] and [17E][61] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
