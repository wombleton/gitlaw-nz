*   #### Preamble
    
    (1) In June 2003, the Court of Appeal held in _Attorney-General v Ngāti Apa_ \[2003\] 3 NZLR 643 that the Māori Land Court had jurisdiction to determine claims of customary ownership to areas of the foreshore and seabed. The [Foreshore and Seabed Act 2004][178] (the _2004 Act_) was enacted partly in response to the Court of Appeal's decision:
    
    (2) In its _Report on the Crown's Foreshore and Seabed Policy_ (Wai 1071), the Waitangi Tribunal found the policy underpinning the [2004 Act][178] in breach of the Treaty of Waitangi. The Tribunal raised questions as to whether the policy complied with the rule of law and the principles of fairness and non-discrimination against a particular group of people. Criticism was voiced against the discriminatory effect of the 2004 Act on whānau, hapū, and iwi by the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the United Nations Special Rapporteur:
    
    (3) In 2009, a Ministerial Review Panel was set up to provide independent advice on the 2004 Act. It, too, viewed the Act as severely discriminatory against whānau, hapū, and iwi. The Panel proposed the repeal of the [2004 Act][178] and engagement with Māori and the public about their interests in the foreshore and seabed, recommending that new legislation be enacted to reflect the Treaty of Waitangi and to recognise and provide for the interests of whānau, hapū, and iwi and for public interests in the foreshore and seabed:
    
    (4) This Act takes account of the intrinsic, inherited rights of iwi, hapū, and whānau, derived in accordance with tikanga and based on their connection with the foreshore and seabed and on the principle of manaakitanga. It translates those inherited rights into legal rights and interests that are inalienable, enduring, and able to be exercised so as to sustain all the people of New Zealand and the coastal marine environment for future generations:

The Parliament of New Zealand therefore enacts as follows:

##### 1 Title
    
*   This Act is the Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Act 2011 and may also be cited as---
        
    *   (a) the Marine and Coastal Area Act 2011; or
    
    *   (b) te Takutai Moana Act 2011\.

        *   (ii) the Minister is satisfied, after considering the matters specified in [section 36(2)][47], that there is good reason not to grant the customary marine title group a freehold interest; and
        
        
    
    *   (c) determine the application, including whether any conditions must be fulfilled before any interest in the reclaimed land is vested and the nature of any such conditions; and

    (4) A certificate signed under subsection (3) is conclusive evidence of the matter stated in the certificate.
    
    (5) A transfer instrument purporting to effect a disposition to which subsection (1) applies---
        
    *   (a) may not be presented for registration under the [Land Transfer Act 1952][208] unless the Minister has signed a certificate in respect of the disposition under subsection (3); and

    (6) If the certificate presented under subsection (5)(b) states that the freehold interest in reclaimed land has been disposed of in accordance with [section 45][57], the Registrar must on registration of the transfer instrument remove from the computer register the record made under [section 39(3)(b)][50].

### Subpart 3---Customary marine title

#### Determination of whether customary marine title exists

##### 58 Customary marine title
    
*   (1) Customary marine title exists in a specified area of the common marine and coastal area if the applicant group---
        
    *   (a) holds the specified area in accordance with tikanga; and
    
    *   (b) has, in relation to the specified area,---
            
        *   (i) exclusively used and occupied it from 1840 to the present day without substantial interruption; or
        
        *   (ii) received it, at any time after 1840, through a customary transfer in accordance with subsection (3).
        
        
    
    (2) For the purpose of subsection (1)(b), there is no substantial interruption to the exclusive use and occupation of a specified area of the common marine and coastal area if, in relation to that area, a resource consent for an activity to be carried out wholly or partly in that area is granted at any time between---
        
    *   (a) the commencement of this Act; and
    
    *   (b) the effective date.
    
    (3) For the purposes of subsection (1)(b)(ii),---
        
    *   (a) a transfer is a customary transfer if a customary interest in a specified area of the common marine and coastal area was transferred---
            
        *   (i) between or among members of the applicant group; or
        
        *   (ii) to the applicant group or some of its members from a group or some members of a group who were not part of the applicant group; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) the transfer was in accordance with tikanga; and
    
    *   (c) the group or members of the group making the transfer---
            
        *   (i) held the specified area in accordance with tikanga; and
        
        *   (ii) had exclusively used and occupied the specified area from 1840 to the time of the transfer without substantial interruption; and
        
        
    
    *   (d) the group or some members of the group to whom the transfer was made have---
            
        *   (i) held the specified area in accordance with tikanga; and
        
        *   (ii) exclusively used and occupied the specified area from the time of the transfer to the present day without substantial interruption.
        
        
    
    (4) Without limiting subsection (2), customary marine title does not exist if that title is extinguished as a matter of law.

##### 59 Matters relevant to whether customary marine title exists
    
*   (1) Matters that may be taken into account in determining whether customary marine title exists in a specified area of the common marine and coastal area include---
        
    *   (a) whether the applicant group or any of its members---
            
        *   (i) own land abutting all or part of the specified area and have done so, without substantial interruption, from 1840 to the present day:
        
        *   (ii) exercise non-commercial customary fishing rights in the specified area, and have done so from 1840 to the present day; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) if paragraph (a) applies, the extent to which there has been such ownership or exercise of fishing rights in the specified area.
    
    (2) To avoid doubt, [section 10][253] of the Treaty of Waitangi (Fisheries Claims) Settlement Act 1992 does not limit subsection (1)(a)(ii).
    
    (3) The use at any time, by persons who are not members of an applicant group, of a specified area of the common marine and coastal area for fishing or navigation does not, of itself, preclude the applicant group from establishing the existence of customary marine title.
    
    (4) For the purpose of subsection (1)(a)(i), _land abutting all or part of the specified area_ means---
        
    *   (a) land that directly abuts the specified area; or
    
    *   (b) land that does not directly abut the specified area, but does directly abut any of the following:
            
        *   (i) a marginal strip (as defined in [section 2(1)][181] of the Conservation Act 1987) that directly abuts the specified area:
        
        *   (ii) an esplanade reserve (as defined in [section 2(1)][179] of the Resource Management Act 1991), but only to the extent that it directly abuts the specified area:

        *   (iv) a Māori reservation (as defined in [section 2(1)][183] of the Reserves Act 1977) that directly abuts the specified area:
        
        *   (v) a road that directly abuts the specified area:

    *   (b) if permission is given, specify---
            
        *   (i) the activity for which permission is given; and

    (4) The customary marine title group is to be treated as having given permission for the resource consent, for its duration, if notice of its decision is not received by the applicant in accordance with subsection (3).
    
    (5) In subsection (3), the grant of a resource consent means that the consent has been granted and any appeal rights exhausted, and that the resource consent would, but for the requirement for the permission of the customary marine title group, commence under [section 116][271] of the Resource Management Act 1991\.

##### 68 Effect of RMA permission right

    *   (b) a right of objection under [section 357][272] or [357A][273] of the Resource Management Act 1991\.
    
    

##### 69 Offence and penalty provision

    *   (b) order that the balance of the total sum described in paragraph (a) be paid---
            
        *   (i) in full to the relevant customary marine title group that brought the prosecution; or
        
        *   (ii) if another person or group brought the prosecution, to that person and the relevant customary marine title group in any proportion that the Environment Court directs.
        
        
    
    (5) Proceedings under this section and [section 70][91] must be heard either---

*   (1) Subsection (3) applies only if, in relation to the exercise of a resource consent,---
        
    *   (a) the RMA permission right is applicable; and
    
    *   (b) a resource consent is exercised without the permission of the customary marine title group being obtained.
    
    (2) If proceedings for an offence are commenced in the Environment Court, the [Criminal Procedure Act 2011][275] applies as if a reference to the District Court were a reference to the Environment Court, with any other necessary modifications.

        *   (ii) the area is nationally important for the conservation of a species; or

##### 82 Newly found taonga tūturu
    
*   (1) Any taonga tūturu found in a customary marine title area on or after the effective date is prima facie the property of the relevant customary marine title group.
    
    (2) Accordingly, [section 11(1)][283] of the Protected Objects Act 1975 does not apply to taonga tūturu to which subsection (1) applies.
    
    (3) Any person finding a taonga tūturu in a customary marine title area has a duty to notify the finding within 28 days, in accordance with [section 11(3)][283] of the Protected Objects Act 1975\.
    
    (4) The obligations of the chief executive under [section 11(4)][283] of the Protected Objects Act 1975 apply, but with the following modifications:

    *   (b) the public notice given by the chief executive must provide for a period of 6 months from the date of the notice for any claims of ownership to the taonga tūturu to be lodged.
    
    (5) To avoid doubt, the discretion conferred on the chief executive or other person by [section 11(2)][283] of the Protected Objects Act 1975 to apply to the Māori Land Court also applies under this section.
    
    (6) If no competing claims have been lodged with the chief executive after 6 months from the date of the notice given under subsection (4)(b), the relevant customary marine title group becomes the owner of the taonga tūturu.
    
    (7) If competing claims are lodged in respect of the taonga tūturu within the specified time,---
        
    *   (a) the relevant customary marine title group must be treated as having also lodged a claim for the ownership of the taonga tūturu; and
    
    *   (b) the ownership of the taonga tūturu must be determined in accordance with [sections 11(6) and (7)][283] and [12][284] of the Protected Objects Act 1975\.
    
    (8) [Section 11(8) and (9)][283] of the Protected Objects Act 1975 apply to the finding of taonga tūturu to which this section applies.
    
    (9) In this section, _relevant customary marine title group_ means the group that holds a customary marine title order or has entered into an agreement in relation to the part of the common marine and coastal area where the taonga tūturu is found.

    (3) The reservation of minerals in favour of the Crown continued by [section 16(2)][22] ceases.
    
    (4) This section does not limit or have any effect on [section 11(1A)][223] of the Crown Minerals Act 1991 (which excludes the reservation of minerals in favour of the Crown from applying to pounamu to which [section 3][224] of the Ngai Tahu (Pounamu Vesting) Act 1997 applies).

##### 84 Status of existing privileges within common marine and coastal area
    
*   (1) Despite [section 83(2) and (3)][111], the following privileges, rights, obligations, functions, and powers (including those preserved by the transitional provisions in [Part 2][285] of the Crown Minerals Act 1991) continue as if [section 83][111] had not been enacted:
        
    *   (a) privileges in existence immediately before the effective date; and
    
    *   (b) rights that can be exercised under the [Crown Minerals Act 1991][225] by the holders of those privileges or any other person; and
    
    *   (c) subsequent rights and privileges granted to those holders or any other person following the exercise of the rights referred to in paragraph (b) (including those provided for by [section 32][286] of the Crown Minerals Act 1991); and

    (2) A customary marine title group is entitled to receive the following royalties:
        
    *   (a) from the Crown, any royalties due to the Crown under the [Crown Minerals Act 1991][225] in respect of minerals (other than petroleum, gold, silver, and uranium existing in their natural condition) that are subject to any privilege referred to in subsection (1)(a) to (d) that applies to its customary marine title area; and
    
    *   (b) from the regional council, any royalties for sand and shingle taken from the customary marine title area imposed by regulations made under the [Resource Management Act 1991][196].

    *   (a) are payable on and after the date on which---
            
        *   (i) a customary marine title order is sealed under [section 113][129]; or
        
        *   (ii) an agreement is brought into effect under [section 96(1)(b)][129]; but

*   (1) This clause applies if---
        
    *   (a) a protected customary rights group gives written approval under [section 55(2)][70] for a resource consent for a proposed activity; and
    
    *   (b) the proposed activity, if carried out under the resource consent, would have the effect of preventing, in whole or in part, the exercise of a protected customary right.
    
    (2) The protected customary rights group must acknowledge in writing that the resource consent, if granted, would have the effect described in subclause (1)(b).

*   (1) If the effect of carrying out an activity under a resource consent granted in the circumstances contemplated by [clause 2][310] would be permanently to cancel a protected customary rights order or agreement, in whole or in part,---
        
    *   (a) the protected customary rights group must apply, as the case requires,---
            
        *   (i) to the High Court under [section 111][147] to vary or cancel the order; or

        *   (i) determined by the High Court under [section 111][147] and all appeal rights have been pursued, and registered under [section 114][153]; or
        
        *   (ii) agreed to by the responsible Minister as if it were an application for an agreement to which [sections 95][128], [96][129], and [114][153] apply.

## Schedule 2  
Process by which certain new activities in customary marine title area become deemed accommodated activities

[ss 63][83], [65][85]

## Part 1  
Deemed accommodated infrastructure

*   1 Prior to an application being lodged under the Resource Management Act 1991 for any resource consents for proposed infrastructure (within the meaning of section 65(1)(a)) in a customary marine title area, the proposed infrastructure may become a deemed accommodated activity in accordance with this Part.

*   2 Any person listed in paragraph (b) of the definition of accommodated infrastructure in section 63 may apply to the Minister for Land Information to declare a proposed infrastructure to be a deemed accommodated activity. In this Part, Minister means the Minister of Land Information.

*   3 In applying under this Part, the applicant must provide to the Minister the following information:
        
    *   (a) a survey and a plan that---
            
        *   (i) shows the customary marine title area where the proposed infrastructure is to be constructed; and
        
        *   (ii) must meet the requirements of the [Cadastral Survey Act 2002][318] as if it were a cadastral survey within the meaning of that Act; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) a detailed description of the proposed infrastructure, including all of the relevant resource consents that will be applied for in support of the proposed infrastructure; and
    
    *   (c) a detailed description of the purpose for which the proposed infrastructure is to be used; and
    
    *   (d) why the applicant considers that the proposed infrastructure complies with [section 65(1)(a)(iii)][85]; and
    
    *   (e) an assessment of all practicable alternative locations (within or outside the coastal marine area), and reasons why the proposed infrastructure cannot practicably be constructed in any location outside of the customary marine title area; and
    
    *   (f) a description of the negotiations that have already taken place with the customary marine title group and, on the basis of those negotiations, reasons why the applicant considers it cannot reasonably obtain the permission of that group for the proposed infrastructure.
    
    

*   4 Upon receipt of an application under clause 3, the Minister must consider and decide to---
        
    *   (a) make an initial decision on whether there is sufficient information to demonstrate that all of those requirements and criteria have been adequately addressed; or
    
    *   (b) seek more information from the applicant; or
    
    *   (c) decline the application on the basis that---
            
        *   (i) insufficient information has been provided; or
        
        *   (ii) the proposed infrastructure does not meet all or any of the requirements and criteria set out in [clause 3][319].
        
        
    
    

*   5 For the avoidance of doubt, a decision under clause 4(a) is not a substantive decision of the Minister in favour of the classification of the proposed infrastructure as a deemed accommodated activity. It is merely a decision that there is sufficient information for the Minister to consider the matter further with the relevant customary marine title group.

*   6 After making a decision under clause 4(a) that there is sufficient information (or after receiving further information under clause 4(b)), the Minister must, before determining the application,---
        
    *   (a) provide to the customary marine title group a copy of the application and any further information received from the applicant; and
    
    *   (b) invite the customary marine title group to identify appropriate compensation for the removal of its RMA permission right or conservation permission right and any other affected right associated with the customary marine title for the proposed infrastructure, in the event that it does not wish to agree to the construction of the proposed infrastructure going ahead; and
    
    *   (c) negotiate in good faith with the customary marine title group in an attempt to compensate for the waiver of its permission rights with respect to the application.
    
    

*   7 This clause applies if, after a period of 3 months,---
        
    *   (a) the customary marine title group fails to respond to any invitation issued under [clause 6][320]; or
    
    *   (b) the customary marine title group refuses to negotiate with the Minister; or
    
    *   (c) the Minister and the group do not agree to waive the permission rights.
    
    

*   8 If clause 7 applies, the Minister must consider the application and any material provided by the customary marine title group and any other relevant information and make a decision on---
        
    *   (a) whether to waive the customary marine title group's permission rights; and
    
    *   (b) whether there are any other affected rights associated with the customary marine title; and
    
    *   (c) what compensation to provide; and
    
    *   (d) whether to classify the matter as a deemed accommodated activity under [section 64][84].
    
    

*   9 In making his or her decision under clause 8, the Minister must consider whether the matters set out in clause 3 have been adequately addressed and, without limiting his or her consideration, the Minister may not agree to waive the permission rights if the Minister is satisfied that the information provided under clause 3(d) and (e) does not justify waiver.

*   10 If the customary marine title group agrees to waive the permission rights, or a decision is made by the Minister under clause 8 to waive the permission rights, then the proposed infrastructure will become a deemed accommodated activity, except that---
        
    *   (a) the waiver of the RMA permission right will operate only for the particular resource consents applied for with respect to the proposed infrastructure (and only as far as the proposed infrastructure is defined in the _Gazette_ notice set out in [clause 11][321]); and
    
    *   (b) the waiver of the permission rights will not otherwise take away the legal effect of the customary marine title order or agreement, except as the customary marine title group expressly agrees otherwise or the Minister decides otherwise; and
    
    *   (c) the waiver of the permission rights will only apply to the activity that is the subject of an application under [clause 3][319] and, unless expressly provided otherwise, it will not prevent the customary marine title group from exercising its permission rights under a customary marine title order or agreement within the same area for any other resource consent application not included in the _Gazette_ notice published under [clause 11][321]; and
    
    *   (d) the customary marine title order or agreement will still be a relevant matter for the consent authority when considering the resource consents necessary for the deemed accommodated activity under the [Resource Management Act 1991][196].
    
    

*   11 If a proposed infrastructure becomes a deemed accommodated activity under clause 10, the Minister must cause a notice to be published in the Gazette giving---
        
    *   (a) a description of the deemed accommodated activity, including a detailed description of the proposed infrastructure and all resource consents that will be applied for as part of the proposed infrastructure; and
    
    *   (b) a description of the customary marine title area and rights that are affected; and
    
    *   (c) a description of the purpose for which the infrastructure is to be used.
    
    

*   12 The Minister must serve a copy of the Gazette notice on the customary marine title group and the relevant regional council.
