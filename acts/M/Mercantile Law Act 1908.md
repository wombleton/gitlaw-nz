#### Dispositions by mercantile agents

##### 3 Powers of mercantile agent with respect to disposition of goods
    
*   (1) Where a mercantile agent is, with the consent of the owner, in possession of goods or of the documents of title to goods, any sale, pledge, or other disposition of the goods made by him when acting in the ordinary course of business of a mercantile agent shall, subject to the provisions of this Part of this Act, be as valid as if he were expressly authorised by the owner of the goods to make the same; provided that the person taking under the disposition acts in good faith, and has not at the time of the disposition notice that the person making the disposition has no authority to make the same.
    
    (1A) Where a mercantile agent is, with the consent of the owner, in possession of goods, or documents of title to the goods, that are subject to a perfected security interest under the [Personal Property Securities Act 1999][58], the person taking under any disposition of the goods is deemed to have notice that the person making the disposition has no authority to make it, unless it is proved that the authority did exist.
    
    (2) Where a mercantile agent has, with the consent of the owner, been in possession of goods or of the documents of title to goods, any sale, pledge, or other disposition which would have been valid if the consent had continued shall be valid notwithstanding the determination of the consent, provided that the person taking under the disposition has not at the time thereof notice that the consent has been determined.
    
    (3) Where a mercantile agent has obtained possession of any documents of title to goods by reason of his being or having been, with the consent of the owner, in possession of the goods represented thereby, or of any other documents of title to the goods, his possession of the first-mentioned documents shall, for the purposes of this Part of this Act, be deemed to be with the consent of the owner.
    
    (4) For the purposes of this Part of this Act the consent of the owner shall be presumed in the absence of evidence to the contrary.
    
    Compare: 1890 No 11 s 4; Factors Act 1889 s 2 (UK)
    
    Section 3(1A) : replaced, on 1 May 2002, by [section 191(1)][59] of the Personal Property Securities Act 1999 (1999 No 126).

##### 4 Effect of pledges of documents of title
    
*   A pledge of the documents of title to goods shall be deemed to be a pledge of the goods.
    
    Compare: 1890 No 11 s 5; Factors Act 1889 s 3 (UK)

##### 5 Pledge for antecedent debt
    
*   Where a mercantile agent pledges goods as security for a debt or liability due from the pledgor to the pledgee before the time of the pledge, the pledgee shall acquire no further right to the goods than could have been enforced by the pledgor at the time of the pledge.
    
    Compare: 1890 No 11 s 6; Factors Act 1889, s 4 (UK)

##### 6 Rights acquired by exchange of goods or documents
    
*   The consideration necessary for the validity of a sale, pledge, or other disposition of goods in pursuance of this Part of this Act may be either a payment in cash, or the delivery or transfer of other goods, or of a document of title to goods, or of a negotiable security, or any other valuable consideration; but where goods are pledged by a mercantile agent in consideration of the delivery or transfer of other goods, or of a document of title to goods, or of a negotiable security, the pledgee shall acquire no right or interest in the goods so pledged in excess of the value of the goods, documents, or security when so delivered or transferred in exchange.
    
    Compare: 1890 No 11 s 7; Factors Act 1889 s 5 (UK)

##### 7 Agreements through clerks, etc
    
*   For the purposes of this Part of this Act an agreement made with a mercantile agent through a clerk or other person authorised in the ordinary course of business to make contracts of sale or pledge on his behalf shall be deemed to be an agreement with the agent.
    
    Compare: 1890 No 11 s 8; Factors Act 1889 s 6 (UK)

##### 8 Provisions as to consignors and consignees
    
*   (1) Where the owner of goods has given possession of the goods to another person for the purpose of consignment or sale, or has shipped the goods in the name of another person, and the consignee of the goods has not had notice that such person is not the owner of the goods, the consignee shall, in respect of advances made to or for the use of such person, have the same lien on the goods as if such person were the owner of the goods, and may transfer any such lien to another person.
    
    (2) Nothing in this section shall limit or affect the validity of any sale, pledge, or disposition by a mercantile agent.
    
    Compare: 1890 No 11 s 9; Factors Act 1889 s 7 (UK)

##### 9 Effect of transfer of document of title to goods on vendor's lien, and right of stoppage _in transitu_
    
*   Where a document of title to goods has been lawfully transferred to a person as a buyer or owner of the goods, and that person transfers the document to a person who takes the document in good faith and for valuable consideration, the last-mentioned transfer shall have the same effect for defeating any vendor's lien or right of stoppage _in transitu_ as the transfer of a bill of lading has for defeating the right of stoppage _in transitu_:
    
    Provided that this section shall be construed subject to [section 48][60] of the Sale of Goods Act 1908\.
    
    Compare: 1890 No 11 s 12; Factors Act 1889 s 10 (UK)

    *   (c) prevent the owner of goods pledged by a mercantile agent from having the right to redeem the goods at any time before the sale thereof, on satisfying the claim for which the goods were pledged and paying to the mercantile agent, if by him required, any money in respect of which such agent would by law be entitled to retain the goods or the documents of title thereto, or any of them, by way of lien as against the owner, or from recovering from any person with whom the goods have been pledged any balance of money remaining in his hands as the produce of the sale of the goods after deducting the amount of his lien; or
    
    *   (d) prevent the owner of goods sold by a mercantile agent from recovering from the buyer the price agreed to be paid for the same, or any part of that price, subject to any right of set-off on the part of the buyer against such agent.

##### 13B Rights under shipping documents
    
*   (1) Subject to this section, a person who becomes---
        
    *   (a) the lawful holder of a bill of lading; or
    
    *   (b) the person who (without being an original party to the contract of carriage) is the person to whom delivery of the goods to which a sea waybill relates is to be made by the carrier in accordance with that contract; or
    
    *   (c) the person to whom delivery of the goods to which a ship's delivery order relates is to be made in accordance with the undertaking contained in the order,---
    
    shall (by virtue of becoming the holder of the bill or, as the case may be, the person to whom delivery is to be made) have transferred to and vested in him or her all rights of suit under the contract of carriage as if that person had been a party to that contract.
    
    (2) Where a person becomes the lawful holder of a bill of lading when possession of the bill no longer gives a right (as against the carrier) to possession of the goods to which the bill relates, that person shall not have any rights transferred to him or her by virtue of subsection (1) of this section unless that person becomes the holder of the bill---
        
    *   (a) by virtue of a transaction effected in pursuance of any contractual or other arrangements made before the time when such a right to possession ceased to attach to possession of the bill; or
    
    *   (b) as a result of the rejection to that person by another person of goods or documents delivered to the other person in pursuance of any such arrangements.
    
    (3) The rights vested in any person by virtue of the operation of subsection (1) of this section in relation to a ship's delivery order---
        
    *   (a) shall be so vested subject to the terms of the order; and

    *   (a) a person with any interest or right in or in relation to goods to which the document relates sustains loss or damage in consequence of a breach of the contract of carriage; but
    
    *   (b) subsection (1) of this section operates in relation to that document so that rights of suit in respect of that breach are vested in another person,---
    
    the other person shall be entitled to exercise those rights for the benefit of the person who sustained the loss or damage to the same extent as they could have been exercised if they had been vested in the person for whose benefit they are exercised.
    
    (5) Where rights are transferred by virtue of the operation of subsection (1) of this section in relation to any document, the transfer for which that subsection provides shall extinguish any entitlement to those rights that derives,---
        
    *   (a) where that document is a bill of lading, from a person's having been an original party to the contract of carriage; or
    
    *   (b) in the case of any document to which this Act applies from the previous operation of that subsection in relation to that document;
    
    but the operation of that subsection shall be without prejudice to any rights which derive from a person's having been an original party to the contract contained in, or evidenced by, a sea waybill and, in relation to a ship's delivery order, shall be without prejudice to any rights deriving otherwise than from the previous operation of that subsection in relation to that order.

    *   (a) takes or demands delivery from the carrier of any of the goods to which the document relates; or
    
    *   (b) makes a claim under the contract of carriage against the carrier in respect of any of those goods; or
    
    *   (c) is a person who, at a time before those rights were vested in him or her, took or demanded delivery from the carrier of any of those goods,---
    
    that person shall (by virtue of taking or demanding delivery or making the claim or, in a case to which paragraph (c) of this subsection applies, of having the rights vested in him or her) become subject to the same liabilities under that contract as if that person had been a party to that contract.
    
    (2) Where the goods to which a ship's delivery order relates form a part only of the goods to which the contract of carriage relates, the liabilities to which any person is subject by virtue of the operation of this subsection in relation to that order shall exclude liabilities in respect of any goods to which the order does not relate.
    
    (3) This section, so far as it imposes liabilities under any contract on any person, shall be without prejudice to the liabilities under the contract of any person as an original party to the contract.
