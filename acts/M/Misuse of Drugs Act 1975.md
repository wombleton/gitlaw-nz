#### Imposition of fines

##### 38 Fine may reflect illicit gains
    
*   In any case where any person is convicted of a drug dealing offence and the court by which he is convicted is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that any money or assets owned by the offender at the date of his trial has or have been acquired by him directly or indirectly from the offence, the court may, having regard to the amount of such money or the value of such assets, impose a fine greater than it would otherwise have imposed on the offender for the offence.

##### 39 Court may impose greater fine having regard to previous dealings
    
*   (1) In any case where any person is convicted of a drug dealing offence (in this section referred to as the primary offence) and the court by which he is convicted is, on the application of the Crown,---
        
    *   (a) satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, before the commission of the primary offence, the offender had engaged in any conduct (other than conduct that constituted the primary offence) that constitutes a drug dealing offence; and
    
    *   (b) satisfied on the balance of probabilities that any money or assets owned by the offender at the date of his trial has or have been acquired by him directly or indirectly from such conduct,---
    
    the court may, having regard to the amount of such money or the value of such assets, impose a fine greater than it would otherwise have imposed on the offender for the primary offence.
    
    (2) Where the prosecutor intends to seek leave to adduce evidence of the matters referred to in subsection (1), he shall give written notice of his intention and of the particulars of the evidence to be adduced to the court and to the defendant as soon as practicable after the conviction is entered, and in any event not later than 5 days before the date set for sentencing.
    
    (3) Notwithstanding anything in subsection (2), where the court is satisfied that the information on which such an application for the exercise of the court's powers could be based has come into the prosecutor's hands too late for him to give 5 days' notice as required by that subsection, the court may allow the prosecutor to give such shorter notice as may be necessary in the circumstances, but shall, if requested to do so by the defendant, postpone sentencing to a date not earlier than 5 days after the prosecutor gives such notice.

##### 40 Court's power not to be exercised in certain cases
    
*   (1) The power conferred by section 39(1) shall not be exercised by any court---

    *   (b) in respect of any money or assets in relation to which the power has been previously exercised by any court.

##### 41 Inability of offender to explain source of money or assets may be evidence
    
*   (1) Where, in any case to which section 38 applies, the offender fails to explain to the court's satisfaction the source of any money or assets owned by him, the court may accept that as evidence that the money or assets was or were derived by the offender from the offence.
    
    (2) Where, on any application for the exercise of the court's power under section 39, the court is satisfied in accordance with subsection (1)(a) of that section that the offender has committed any previous drug dealing offence, and the offender fails to explain to the court's satisfaction the source of any money or assets owned by him, the court may accept that as evidence that the money or assets was or were derived by the offender from that previous drug dealing offence.

##### 42 Court may treat alienated property as offender's
    
*   Where, in any case to which section 38 or section 39 applies, it appears to the court that any disposition of money or assets has been made, whether for value or not, by or on behalf of or by direction of or in the interests of the defendant to defeat the exercise of the court's power under those sections, the court may, on the application of the prosecutor or of its own motion, treat the money or assets as belonging to the offender for the purposes of those sections.

#### Enforcement of fines

##### 43 Enforcement of fines
    
*   (1) If the court sentences an offender on conviction for a drug dealing offence to pay a fine to which section 38 or 39 applies, section 19 of the Crimes Act 1961 or Part 3 of the Summary Proceedings Act 1957 applies (whichever is applicable) to the enforcement of the fine, subject to any necessary modifications.
    
    (2) The court or the Registrar may make any orders as are appropriate under any of the provisions specified in subsection (1) in respect of any money or assets that are treated as belonging to the offender under section 42 (which are deemed to be the offender's property for the purposes of this subsection).
    
    (3) In subsection (2), _Registrar_---
        
    *   (a) means any Registrar of the High Court or a District Court; and
    
    *   (b) includes any Deputy Registrar.

##### 45 Fine imposed in District Court may be enforced in High Court
    
*   Where any District Court sentences an offender on conviction of a drug dealing offence to pay a fine and the Registrar of that court is satisfied that payment of that fine may be more effectively enforced in the High Court, he may file a certificate to that effect under his hand in that court, containing full particulars of the conviction and the amount of the fine, and thereafter payment of the fine shall be enforced as if the fine had been imposed in the High Court.

## Schedule 2  
Statement of rights

[s 13B(b)][266]

*   Schedule 2: inserted, on 1 October 1985, by section 4 of the Misuse of Drugs Amendment Act 1985 (1985 No 130).

You have been detained under section 13A of the Misuse of Drugs Amendment Act 1978 because it is believed that you have secreted within your body any Class A controlled drugs or Class B controlled drugs for an unlawful purpose.

#### **Read this notice carefully. It tells you what rights you have while the detention continues.**

##### Medical examinations:

You will be asked if you wish to undergo certain types of medical examination that may help to determine whether or not you have any Class A controlled drugs or Class B controlled drugs secreted within your body.

For this reason, a doctor will be asked to see you to explain just what is involved in each type of examination.

#### **No such examination may take place without your consent**

If you do wish to undergo an examination, you will be asked to put your consent to the examination in writing.

If you refuse your consent, you may change your mind later. Just tell one of the officers supervising your detention.

If you decide not to have an examination, that fact, and any reasons you give for it, may be put before the Judge in any further proceedings.

##### Detention warrant:

As soon as possible after detaining you, the officer must apply to a District Court Judge for a warrant to authorise your continued detention.

If the Judge grants the warrant, you may be detained for up to 7 days, or such shorter period as the Judge may order. However, a warrant may be renewed by a Judge for further periods of up to 7 days each, if the Judge is satisfied that there are still reasonable grounds for believing that you have any Class A controlled drugs or Class B controlled drugs secreted within your body. You may not be detained for longer than 21 days.

##### Searches:

If a detention warrant is issued there are certain circumstances in which a constable or a Customs officer may undertake a rub-down search or strip search, or both.

##### Supervising lawyer and doctor:

If the Judge issues a detention warrant, he or she must appoint a lawyer and a doctor to see that your rights are protected and that you are properly cared for while you are being detained. These people are NOT there as part of the team detaining you: they are there as agents of the court to ensure fair play. You should consult them on any legal or medical matter that is worrying you.

However, you are also entitled to arrange for your own lawyer or doctor to visit and advise you.

##### Right of appeal:

You may appeal to the High Court against the issue or renewal of a detention warrant, or against any condition of detention imposed by the District Court Judge. If you wish to appeal, consult the court lawyer or your own lawyer.

##### Visiting rights:

While you are detained, the court lawyer and the court doctor may visit you at any time. Your own lawyer, your own doctor, and any other person you may reasonably wish to see may call on you at any reasonable time.

##### End of detention:

You must be released if the Judge refuses to grant a detention warrant, or refuses to renew it, or the warrant is cancelled by the High Court on appeal.

You must also be released if a medical examination shows that you do not have any Class A controlled drugs or Class B controlled drugs secreted within your body, or if the officers detaining you cease to believe that you have any such drugs secreted within your body.

If you are arrested, your detention under section 13A of the Misuse of Drugs Amendment Act 1978 will cease, and you will then be detained under arrest. From then on, you will have all the rights of an arrested person.

##### Court access:

You will not be entitled to appear in court while you are in detention. However, the court lawyer and your own lawyer will be entitled to address the court on appeal against a detention warrant or a condition of detention, or where an application is made for a renewal of the warrant.

##### Further advice:

This is only a brief summary of your rights. If there is anything you do not understand, talk to the court lawyer or your own lawyer.
    
*   Schedule 2: amended, on 1 October 2008, pursuant to [section 116(a)(ii)][158] of the Policing Act 2008 (2008 No 72).
*   Schedule 2: amended, on 22 June 2005, by [section 29][267] of the Misuse of Drugs Amendment Act 2005 (2005 No 81).
