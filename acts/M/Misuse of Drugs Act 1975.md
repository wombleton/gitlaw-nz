*   In any case where any person is convicted of a drug dealing offence and the court by which he is convicted is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that any money or assets owned by the offender at the date of his trial has or have been acquired by him directly or indirectly from the offence, the court may, having regard to the amount of such money or the value of such assets, impose a fine greater than it would otherwise have imposed on the offender for the offence.

##### 39 Court may impose greater fine having regard to previous dealings
    
*   (1) In any case where any person is convicted of a drug dealing offence (in this section referred to as the primary offence) and the court by which he is convicted is, on the application of the Crown,---
        
    *   (a) satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, before the commission of the primary offence, the offender had engaged in any conduct (other than conduct that constituted the primary offence) that constitutes a drug dealing offence; and
    
    *   (b) satisfied on the balance of probabilities that any money or assets owned by the offender at the date of his trial has or have been acquired by him directly or indirectly from such conduct,---
    
    the court may, having regard to the amount of such money or the value of such assets, impose a fine greater than it would otherwise have imposed on the offender for the primary offence.
    
    (2) Where the prosecutor intends to seek leave to adduce evidence of the matters referred to in subsection (1), he shall give written notice of his intention and of the particulars of the evidence to be adduced to the court and to the defendant as soon as practicable after the conviction is entered, and in any event not later than 5 days before the date set for sentencing.
    
    (3) Notwithstanding anything in subsection (2), where the court is satisfied that the information on which such an application for the exercise of the court's powers could be based has come into the prosecutor's hands too late for him to give 5 days' notice as required by that subsection, the court may allow the prosecutor to give such shorter notice as may be necessary in the circumstances, but shall, if requested to do so by the defendant, postpone sentencing to a date not earlier than 5 days after the prosecutor gives such notice.

##### 40 Court's power not to be exercised in certain cases
    
*   (1) The power conferred by section 39(1) shall not be exercised by any court---

    *   (b) in respect of any money or assets in relation to which the power has been previously exercised by any court.
    
    (2) The powers conferred by sections 38 and 39(1) shall not be exercised by any District Court so as to impose a fine greater than the maximum prescribed by section 6(3) of the principal Act.

*   (1) Where, in any case to which section 38 applies, the offender fails to explain to the court's satisfaction the source of any money or assets owned by him, the court may accept that as evidence that the money or assets was or were derived by the offender from the offence.
    
    (2) Where, on any application for the exercise of the court's power under section 39, the court is satisfied in accordance with subsection (1)(a) of that section that the offender has committed any previous drug dealing offence, and the offender fails to explain to the court's satisfaction the source of any money or assets owned by him, the court may accept that as evidence that the money or assets was or were derived by the offender from that previous drug dealing offence.

##### 42 Court may treat alienated property as offender's
    
*   Where, in any case to which section 38 or section 39 applies, it appears to the court that any disposition of money or assets has been made, whether for value or not, by or on behalf of or by direction of or in the interests of the defendant to defeat the exercise of the court's power under those sections, the court may, on the application of the prosecutor or of its own motion, treat the money or assets as belonging to the offender for the purposes of those sections.

## Schedule 2  
Statement of rights

[s 13B(b)][310]

*   Schedule 2: added, on 1 October 1985, by section 4 of the Misuse of Drugs Amendment Act 1985 (1985 No 130).

You have been detained under section 13A of the Misuse of Drugs Amendment Act 1978 because it is believed that you have secreted within your body any Class A controlled drugs or Class B controlled drugs for an unlawful purpose.

#### **Read this notice carefully. It tells you what rights you have while the detention continues.**

##### Medical examinations:

You will be asked if you wish to undergo certain types of medical examination that may help to determine whether or not you have any Class A controlled drugs or Class B controlled drugs secreted within your body.

For this reason, a doctor will be asked to see you to explain just what is involved in each type of examination.

#### **No such examination may take place without your consent**

If you do wish to undergo an examination, you will be asked to put your consent to the examination in writing.

If you refuse your consent, you may change your mind later. Just tell one of the officers supervising your detention.

If you decide not to have an examination, that fact, and any reasons you give for it, may be put before the Judge in any further proceedings.

##### Detention warrant:

As soon as possible after detaining you, the officer must apply to a District Court Judge for a warrant to authorise your continued detention.

If the Judge grants the warrant, you may be detained for up to 7 days, or such shorter period as the Judge may order. However, a warrant may be renewed by a Judge for further periods of up to 7 days each, if the Judge is satisfied that there are still reasonable grounds for believing that you have any Class A controlled drugs or Class B controlled drugs secreted within your body. You may not be detained for longer than 21 days.

##### Searches:

If a detention warrant is issued there are certain circumstances in which a constable or a Customs officer may undertake a rub-down search or strip search, or both.

##### Supervising lawyer and doctor:

If the Judge issues a detention warrant, he or she must appoint a lawyer and a doctor to see that your rights are protected and that you are properly cared for while you are being detained. These people are NOT there as part of the team detaining you: they are there as agents of the court to ensure fair play. You should consult them on any legal or medical matter that is worrying you.

However, you are also entitled to arrange for your own lawyer or doctor to visit and advise you.

##### Right of appeal:

You may appeal to the High Court against the issue or renewal of a detention warrant, or against any condition of detention imposed by the District Court Judge. If you wish to appeal, consult the court lawyer or your own lawyer.

##### Visiting rights:

While you are detained, the court lawyer and the court doctor may visit you at any time. Your own lawyer, your own doctor, and any other person you may reasonably wish to see may call on you at any reasonable time.

##### End of detention:

You must be released if the Judge refuses to grant a detention warrant, or refuses to renew it, or the warrant is cancelled by the High Court on appeal.

You must also be released if a medical examination shows that you do not have any Class A controlled drugs or Class B controlled drugs secreted within your body, or if the officers detaining you cease to believe that you have any such drugs secreted within your body.

If you are arrested, your detention under section 13A of the Misuse of Drugs Amendment Act 1978 will cease, and you will then be detained under arrest. From then on, you will have all the rights of an arrested person.

##### Court access:

You will not be entitled to appear in court while you are in detention. However, the court lawyer and your own lawyer will be entitled to address the court on appeal against a detention warrant or a condition of detention, or where an application is made for a renewal of the warrant.

##### Further advice:

This is only a brief summary of your rights. If there is anything you do not understand, talk to the court lawyer or your own lawyer.
    
*   Schedule 2: amended, on 1 October 2008, pursuant to [section 116(a)(ii)][157] of the Policing Act 2008 (2008 No 72).
*   Schedule 2: amended, on 22 June 2005, by [section 29][311] of the Misuse of Drugs Amendment Act 2005 (2005 No 81).

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1975\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 October 2012, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][333] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][334] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][335] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][336] and [17E][337] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
