An Act to provide for the symbolic return of Mount Egmont to the Taranaki Maori Trust Board on behalf of the Maori tribes concerned, and the gift of the Mountain back to the Crown by the Board for the purposes of a national park for the use and enjoyment of all the people of New Zealand
    
*   Whereas Mount Egmont (known in Maori as Taranaki) (in this preamble referred to as the Mountain) comprises part of the Egmont National Park: And whereas the Mountain comprises, in part, land that was confiscated by the Crown from its former Maori owners pursuant to the New Zealand Settlements Act 1863 and, in part, land that has been purchased by the Crown from its former Maori owners: And whereas certain provisions in relation to the confiscations above referred to were made by the Taranaki Maori Claims Settlement Act 1944 and are now contained in the [Maori Trust Boards Act 1955][13], which Act continued in existence the Taranaki Maori Trust Board: And whereas, in consideration of the special significance that the Mountain has for the Maori people of the Taranaki district, it has been agreed between the Crown and representatives of those Maori people that the Mountain shall be formally transferred to the Taranaki Maori Trust Board as representing the Maori people of the Taranaki district in order that it may be given back to the Crown for the purposes of a National Park as a free gift and as a symbol of love to all the people of New Zealand by the Board on behalf of the Atiawa, Ngati Mutunga, Ngati Maru, Ngati Tama, Ngati Ruanui, Ngaruahine, Taranaki, and Ngarauru tribes, and their descendants.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Mount Egmont Vesting Act 1978\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 April 1987, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][17] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][18] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][19] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][20] and [17E][21] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
