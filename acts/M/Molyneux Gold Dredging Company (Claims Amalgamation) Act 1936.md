An Act to provide for the amalgamation of several special dredging claims held under the Mining Act 1926 by the Molyneux Gold Dredging Company, Limited, and for the protection of the claims pending their amalgamation
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    Whereas the Molyneux Gold Dredging Company, Limited, a company incorporated in England (hereinafter referred to as the _company_), is the holder under the Mining Act 1926 of 8 licences, numbered respectively 1184, 1185, 1229, 1230, 1288, 1289, 1290, and 5359, for special dredging claims upon or adjacent to the Molyneux River between Cromwell and Alexandra:
    
    And whereas the company has expended large sums of money in the construction of a dredge to work the claims, but, owing to causes beyond the control of the company, it has not yet been possible to complete the dredge and place it on the river:
    
    And whereas, on account of delay in constructing the dredge and in commencing to work the claims, the licences for some of the claims may be deemed to be abandoned by operation of law or may be liable to forfeiture in accordance with the provisions of the Mining Act 1926:
    
    And whereas it is desirable that statutory provision should be made authorising the amalgamation of the claims notwithstanding such abandonment and liability to forfeiture, and protecting the claims pending their amalgamation.

##### 1 Short Title
    
*   This Act may be cited as the Molyneux Gold Dredging Company (Claims Amalgamation) Act 1936\.

##### 2 Authority for amalgamation of company's claims
    
*   (1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in paragraphs (b) and (d) of section 159 of the Mining Act 1926, or in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of paragraph (e) of section 156 of that Act, the claims held by the company as hereinbefore recited may be amalgamated into 1 claim under the said section 159 without the warden being satisfied that there has been expended in mining operations on each of the claims not less than such sum as is prescribed, and that the licences for the claims are validly subsisting, and are neither abandoned by operation of law nor liable to forfeiture, and that no proceedings are pending in respect of such abandonment or forfeiture.
    
    (2) Except as expressly provided in this section, the provisions of the Mining Act 1926 shall, so far as they are applicable, apply with respect to any amalgamated claim granted under this section and to every application or licence therefor.

##### 3 Protection of claims pending amalgamation
    
*   The licences now held by the company as hereinbefore recited shall not be liable to forfeiture, or be deemed to be abandoned by operation of law, for any cause whatsoever (whether arising before or after the passing of this Act):
    
    provided that the protection afforded by this section shall cease on 28 February 1937 or on the date of the amalgamation of the claims, whichever date is the earlier.

##### 4 Private Act
    
*   This Act is hereby declared to be a private Act.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Molyneux Gold Dredging Company (Claims Amalgamation) Act 1936\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 12 June 1936, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][7] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][8] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][9] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][10] and [17E][11] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
