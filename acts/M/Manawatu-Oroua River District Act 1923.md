        *   (i.) If the River Board and such local authority or ratepayer cannot agree as to the price to be paid for such protection-works, machinery, or assets, which price shall be such part of the sum actually paid by such local authority or ratepayer for such protection-works, machinery, or assets as represents the value to the River Board thereof as part of its undertaking, the dispute shall be referred to the determination and award of two arbitrators and their umpire, pursuant to and so as to have all the incidents and consequences of an arbitration under the [Arbitration Act 1996][44].

        *   (iii.) In case such purchase is made from a ratepayer the River Board, in lieu of paying for such protection-works, machinery, or assets, may issue debentures to such ratepayer for such period, on such terms, and at such rate of interest as the River Board and such ratepayer shall agree.

All other lands, which shall be non-rateable: or, at the River Board's option, into four or more classes by reference to the degree, if any, to which those lands have received or are likely to receive either an increase in value or an indirect benefit from the works and operations carried out or proposed to be carried out by the River Board. In the event of the second method of classification being adopted the rates shall be levied upon all the said classes of land (other than lands classified as not having received and not being likely to receive any increase in value or any indirect benefit from the said works and operations) in such proportions as the River Board in each case approves.

##### 39 Power to make by-laws
    
*   The River Board may from time to time by special order make by-laws---

    and may by any such by-law impose a fine not exceeding twenty dollars for any breach thereof:
    
    Provided always that no such by-law shall contravene any of the provisions herein contained with regard to local authorities and Harbour Boards.
