    (3) Except as provided in subsection (4), the result of a positive evidential breath test is not admissible in evidence in proceedings for an offence against any of [sections 40C to 40E][96] if---
        
    *   (a) the seafarer who underwent the test is not advised by an enforcement officer, without delay after the result of the test is ascertained, that the test was positive and that, if the seafarer does not request a blood test within 10 minutes, in the case of a positive test that indicates that the proportion of alcohol in the seafarer's breath exceeds 250 micrograms of alcohol per litre of breath, the test could of itself be conclusive evidence to lead to that seafarer's conviction for an offence against this Part; or
    
    *   (b) the seafarer who underwent the test---
            
        *   (i) advises an enforcement officer, within 10 minutes of being advised of the matters specified in paragraph (a), that the seafarer wishes to undergo a blood test; and

    (6) If a blood specimen is destroyed in accordance with [section 40N(7)][107], that act does not affect the admissibility in proceedings of a certificate given in respect of the specimen by an approved analyst for the purposes of this Part.

##### 41 Issue of maritime documents and recognition of documents
    
*   (1) After considering any application under [section 35][85], the Director shall, as soon as practicable, grant the application if he or she is satisfied that---
        
    *   (a) all things in respect of which the document is sought or, in the case of an application for recognition of a document as a maritime document, all things to which the document relates, meet any relevant prescribed requirements; and
    
    *   (b) the applicant and any person who is to have or is likely to have control over the exercise of the privileges under the document---
            
        *   (i) either hold the relevant prescribed qualifications and experience or hold such qualifications as are acceptable to the Director under subsection (2); and
        
        *   (ii) are fit and proper persons to have such control or hold the document; and
        
        *   (iii) meet all other relevant prescribed requirements; and
        
        
    
    *   (c) it is not contrary to the interests of maritime safety for the document to be granted, renewed, or recognised.
    
    (2) For the purpose of granting or renewing a maritime document, or recognising a document as a maritime document, the Director may, subject to any provisions in the maritime rules, recognise such qualifications or certifications as he or she considers appropriate in each case.
    
    (3) In no case shall the Director recognise foreign qualifications or foreign certificates where---
        
    *   (a) the requirements to gain such qualifications or to obtain such certificates are less than the requirements to gain similar qualifications or to obtain similar certificates in New Zealand; and
    
    *   (b) the Director believes that to recognise such qualifications or certificates might pose a risk or danger to the safety of any person, to property, or to the marine environment.
    
    (4) Where a licence, permit, certificate, or other document is recognised by the Director under this section, the Director shall either---
        
    *   (a) issue an equivalent maritime document under this section; or
    
    *   (b) notify in writing such recognition.
    
    (5) It shall be a condition of every current maritime document issued or recognised by the Director that the holder shall continue to satisfy the fit and proper person criteria specified in subsection (1)(b)(ii).
    
    (6) Where the Director declines to grant an application under [section 35][85], the applicant may appeal against that decision to a District Court under [section 424][632].
    
    (7) Nothing in this section applies in respect of any ship, crew, or maritime product in respect of which [section 42][120] applies.

    (2) The Director shall not accept, or shall suspend acceptance of, any documents referred to in subsection (1) where he or she has clear grounds for believing that---
        
    *   (a) the condition of the ship or maritime product does not correspond substantially with the particulars of any document relating to the ship or maritime product; or
    
    *   (b) the condition of the ship or maritime product has not been maintained in accordance with the provisions of any requirements leading to the issue of that document; or
    
    *   (c) the ship is not in all respects fit to proceed to sea without danger to the ship or the persons on board or without presenting an unreasonable threat of harm to the marine environment; or
    
    *   (d) the ship or maritime product has been materially altered without the sanction of the State that issued or approved the document; or
    
    *   (e) the document has been fraudulently obtained or the holder of the document is not the person to whom the document was originally issued.

    (2) Without limiting the general provisions of subsection (1), the Director may suspend any maritime document, or the recognition of any document as a maritime document, relating to the use of any ship, or maritime product, or impose conditions in respect of any such document, if he or she considers that there is reasonable doubt as to the seaworthiness of the ship or as to the quality or safety of the maritime product to which the document relates.

*   (d) ""Ship"" means any vessel used for the carriage of goods by sea.

*   (e) ""Carriage of goods"" covers the period from the time when the goods are loaded on to the time they are discharged from the ship.

## Article 2

Subject to the provisions of Article 6, under every contract of carriage of goods by sea the carrier, in relation to the loading, handling, stowage, carriage, custody, care and discharge of such goods, shall be subject to the responsibilities and liabilities, and entitled to the rights and immunities hereinafter set forth.

## Article 3
    
*   1\. The carrier shall be bound before and at the beginning of the voyage to exercise due diligence to---
        
    *   (a) Make the ship seaworthy.
    
    *   (b) Properly man, equip and supply the ship.
    
    *   (c) Make the holds, refrigerating and cool chambers, and all other parts of the ship in which goods are carried, fit and safe for their reception, carriage and preservation.
    
    

*   2\. Subject to the provisions of Article 4, the carrier shall properly and carefully load, handle, stow, carry, keep, care for, and discharge the goods carried.

*   3\. After receiving the goods into his charge the carrier or the master or agent of the carrier shall, on demand of the shipper, issue to the shipper a bill of lading showing among other things---
        
    *   (a) The leading marks necessary for identification of the goods as the same are furnished in writing by the shipper before the loading of such goods starts, provided such marks are stamped or otherwise shown clearly upon the goods if uncovered, or on the cases or coverings in which such goods are contained, in such a manner as should ordinarily remain legible until the end of the voyage.
    
    *   (b) Either the number of packages or pieces, or the quantity, or weight, as the case may be, as furnished in writing by the shipper.
    
    *   (c) The apparent order and condition of the goods.
    
    Provided that no carrier, master or agent of the carrier shall be bound to state or show in the bill of lading any marks, number, quantity, or weight which he has reasonable ground for suspecting not accurately to represent the goods actually received, or which he has had no reasonable means of checking.

*   4\. Such a bill of lading shall be prima facie evidence of the receipt by the carrier of the goods as therein described in accordance with paragraph 3(a), (b) and (c). **\[**However, proof to the contrary shall not be admissible when the bill of lading has been transferred to a third party acting in good faith.**\]**
        
    *   The words in square brackets were added by the Protocol of 23 February 1968\.
    
    

*   5\. The shipper shall be deemed to have guaranteed to the carrier the accuracy at the time of shipment of the marks, number, quantity and weight, as furnished by him, and the shipper shall indemnify the carrier against all loss, damages and expenses arising or resulting from inaccuracies in such particulars. The right of the carrier to such indemnity shall in no way limit his responsibility and liability under the contract of carriage to any person other than the shipper.

*   6\. Unless notice of loss or damage and the general nature of such loss or damage be given in writing to the carrier or his agent at the port of discharge before or at the time of the removal of the goods into the custody of the person entitled to delivery thereof under the contract of carriage, or, if the loss or damage be not apparent, within three days, such removal shall be prima facie evidence of the delivery by the carrier of the goods as described in the bill of lading.
    
    The notice in writing need not be given if the state of the goods has, at the time of their receipt, been the subject of joint survey or inspection.
    
    **\[**Subject to paragraph 6bis the carrier and the ship shall in any event be discharged from all liability whatsoever in respect of the goods, unless suit is brought within one year of their delivery or of the date when they should have been delivered. This period may, however, be extended if the parties so agree after the cause of action has arisen.**\]**
        
    *   The words in square brackets were substituted by the Protocol of 23 February 1968\.
    
    In the case of any actual or apprehended loss or damage the carrier and the receiver shall give all reasonable facilities to each other for inspecting and tallying the goods.

*   **\[**6bis. An action for indemnity against a third person may be brought even after the expiration of the year provided for in the preceding paragraph if brought within the time allowed by the law of the court seized of the case. However, the time allowed shall be not less than three months, commencing from the day when the person bringing such action for indemnity has settled the claim or has been served with process in the action against himself.**\]**
        
    *   The words in square brackets were added by the Protocol of 23 February 1968\.
    
    

*   7\. After the goods are loaded the bill of lading to be issued by the carrier, master, or agent of the carrier, to the shipper shall, if the shipper so demands, be a ""shipped"" bill of lading, provided that if the shipper shall have previously taken up any document of title to such goods, he shall surrender the same as against the issue of the ""shipped"" bill of lading, but at the option of the carrier such document of title may be noted at the port of shipment by the carrier, master, or agent with the name or names of the ship or ships upon which the goods have been shipped and the date or dates of shipment, and when so noted, if it shows the particulars mentioned in paragraph 3 of Article 3, shall for the purpose of this article be deemed to constitute a ""shipped"" bill of lading.

*   8\. Any clause, covenant, or agreement in a contract of carriage relieving the carrier or the ship from liability for loss or damage to, or in connection with, goods arising from negligence, fault, or failure in the duties and obligations provided in this article or lessening such liability otherwise than as provided in this convention, shall be null and void and of no effect. A benefit of insurance in favour of the carrier or similar clause shall be deemed to be a clause relieving the carrier from liability.

## Article 4
    
*   1\. Neither the carrier nor the ship shall be liable for loss or damage arising or resulting from unseaworthiness unless caused by want of due diligence on the part of the carrier to make the ship seaworthy, and to secure that the ship is properly manned, equipped and supplied, and to make the holds, refrigerating and cool chambers and all other parts of the ship in which goods are carried fit and safe for their reception, carriage and preservation in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 3\. Whenever loss or damage has resulted from unseaworthiness the burden of proving the exercise of due diligence shall be on the carrier or other person claiming exemption under this article.

*   2\. Neither the carrier nor the ship shall be responsible for loss or damage arising or resulting from---
        
    *   (a) Act, neglect or default of the master, mariner, pilot, or the servants of the carrier in the navigation or in the management of the ship.
    
    *   (b) Fire, unless caused by the actual fault or privity of the carrier.
    
    *   (c) Perils, dangers and accidents of the sea or other navigable waters.
    
    *   (d) Act of God.
    
    *   (e) Act of war.
    
    *   (f) Act of public enemies.
    
    *   (g) Arrest or restraint of princes, rulers or people, or seizure under legal process.

    *   (k) Riots and civil commotions.
    
    *   (l) Saving or attempting to save life or property at sea.

    *   (p) Latent defects not discoverable by due diligence.
    
    *   (q) Any other cause arising without the actual fault or privity of the carrier, or without the actual fault or neglect of the agents or servants of the carrier, but the burden of proof shall be on the person claiming the benefit of this exception to show that neither the actual fault or privity of the carrier nor the fault or neglect of the agents or servants of the carrier contributed to the loss or damage.
    
    

*   3\. The shipper shall not be responsible for loss or damage sustained by the carrier or the ship arising or resulting from any cause without the act, fault or neglect of the shipper, his agents or his servants.

*   4\. Any deviation in saving or attempting to save life or property at sea or any reasonable deviation shall not be deemed to be an infringement or breach of this convention or of the contract of carriage, and the carrier shall not be liable for any loss or damage resulting therefrom.

**\[**5\.
    
*   (a) Unless the nature and value of such goods have been declared by the shipper before shipment and inserted in the bill of lading, neither the carrier nor the ship shall in any event be or become liable for any loss or damage to or in connection with the goods in an amount exceeding 666.67 units of account per package or unit or 2 units of account per kilogramme of gross weight of the goods lost or damaged, whichever is the higher.**\]**

*   **\[**(b) The total amount recoverable shall be calculated by reference to the value of such goods at the place and time at which the goods are discharged from the ship in accordance with the contract or should have been so discharged.
    
    The value of the goods shall be fixed according to the commodity exchange price, or, if there be no such price, according to the current market price, or, if there be no commodity exchange price or current market price, by reference to the normal value of goods of the same kind and quality.

*   (c) Where a container, pallet or similar article of transport is used to consolidate goods, the number of packages or units enumerated in the Bill of Lading as packed in such article of transport shall be deemed the number of packages or units for the purpose of this paragraph as far as these packages or units are concerned. Except as aforesaid such article of transport shall be considered the package or unit.**\]**

*   **\[**(d) The unit of account mentioned in this Article is the Special Drawing Right as defined by the International Monetary Fund. The amounts mentioned in subparagraph (a) of this paragraph shall be converted into national currency on the basis of the value of that currency on a date to be determined by the law of the court seized of the case.

The value of the national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a State which is a member of the International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in accordance with the method of valuation applied by the International Monetary Fund in effect at the date in question for its operations and transactions. The value of the national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a State which is not a member of the International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in a manner determined by that State.

Nevertheless, a State which is not a member of the International Monetary Fund and whose law does not permit the application of the provisions of the preceding sentences may, at the time of ratification of the Protocol of 1979 or accession thereto or at any time thereafter, declare that the limits of liability provided for in this Convention to be applied in its territory shall be fixed as follows:

*   (i) in respect of the amount of 666.67 units of account mentioned in subparagraph (a) of paragraph 5 of this Article, 10,000 monetary units;

*   (ii) in respect of the amount of 2 units of account mentioned in subparagraph (a) of paragraph 5 of this Article, 30 monetary units.

The monetary unit referred to in the preceding sentence corresponds to 65.5 milligrammes of gold of millesimal fineness 900′. The conversion of the amounts specified in that sentence into the national currency shall be made according to the law of the State concerned.

The calculation and the conversion mentioned in the preceding sentences shall be made in such a manner as to express in the national currency of the State as far as possible the same real value for the amounts in subparagraph (a) of paragraph 5 of this Article as is expressed there in units of account.

States shall communicate to the depository the manner of calculation or the result of the conversion as the case may be, when depositing an instrument of ratification of the Protocol of 1979 or of accession thereto and whenever there is a change in either.**\]**

*   **\[**(e) Neither the carrier nor the ship shall be entitled to the benefit of the limitation of liability provided for in this paragraph if it is proved that the damage resulted from an act or omission of the carrier done with intent to cause damage, or recklessly and with knowledge that damage would probably result.

*   (f) The declaration mentioned in subparagraph (a) of this paragraph, if embodied in the Bill of Lading, shall be prima facie evidence, but shall not be binding or conclusive on the carrier.

*   (g) By agreement between the carrier, master or agent of the carrier and the shipper other maximum amounts than those mentioned in subparagraph (a) of this paragraph may be fixed, provided that no maximum amount so fixed shall be less than the appropriate maximum mentioned in that subparagraph.

*   (h) Neither the carrier nor the ship shall be responsible in any event for loss or damage to, or in connection with, goods if the nature or value thereof has been knowingly mis-stated by the shipper in the Bill of Lading.**\]**

*   Paragraph 5(a) was inserted by the Protocol of 21 December 1979\.
*   Paragraphs 5(b) and 5(c) were inserted by the Protocol of 23 February 1968\.
*   Paragraph 5(d) and the succeeding unlettered paragraphs were inserted by the Protocol of 21 December 1979\.
*   Paragraphs 5(e) to 5(h) were inserted by the Protocol of 23 February 1968\.

*   6\. Goods of an inflammable, explosive or dangerous nature to the shipment whereof the carrier, master or agent of the carrier has not consented with knowledge of their nature and character, may at any time before discharge be landed at any place, or destroyed or rendered innocuous by the carrier without compensation and the shipper of such goods shall be liable for all damages and expenses directly or indirectly arising out of or resulting from such shipment. If any such goods shipped with such knowledge and consent shall become a danger to the ship or cargo, they may in like manner be landed at any place, or destroyed or rendered innocuous by the carrier without liability on the part of the carrier except to general average, if any.

## **\[**Article 4bis
    
*   1\. The defences and limits of liability provided for in this Convention shall apply in any action against the carrier in respect of loss or damage to goods covered by a contract of carriage whether the action be founded in contract or in tort.

*   2\. If such an action is brought against a servant or agent of the carrier (such servant or agent not being an independent contractor), such servant or agent shall be entitled to avail himself of the defences and limits of liability which the carrier is entitled to invoke under this Convention.

*   3\. The aggregate of the amounts recoverable from the carrier, and such servants and agents, shall in no case exceed the limit provided for in this Convention.

*   4\. Nevertheless, a servant or agent of the carrier shall not be entitled to avail himself of the provisions of this Article, if it is proved that the damage resulted from an act or omission of the servant or agent done with intent to cause damage or recklessly and with knowledge that damage would probably result.**\]**

## Article 5

A carrier shall be at liberty to surrender in whole or in part all or any of his rights and immunities or to increase any of his responsibilities and obligations under this convention, provided such surrender or increase shall be embodied in the Bill of Lading issued to the shipper. The provisions of this convention shall not be applicable to charter parties, but if bills of lading are issued in the case of a ship under a charter party they shall comply with the terms of this convention. Nothing in these rules shall be held to prevent the insertion in a Bill of Lading of any lawful provision regarding general average.

## Article 6

Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding articles, a carrier, master or agent of the carrier and a shipper shall in regard to any particular goods be at liberty to enter into any agreement in any terms as to the responsibility and liability of the carrier for such goods, and as to the rights and immunities of the carrier in respect of such goods, or his obligation as to seaworthiness, so far as this stipulation is not contrary to public policy, or the care or diligence of his servants or agents in regard to the loading, handling, stowage, carriage, custody, care and discharge of the goods carried by sea, provided that in this case no bill of lading has been or shall be issued and that the terms agreed shall be embodied in a receipt which shall be a non-negotiable document and shall be marked as such.

Any agreement so entered into shall have full legal effect.

Provided that this article shall not apply to ordinary commercial shipments made in the ordinary course of trade, but only to other shipments where the character or condition of the property to be carried or the circumstances, terms and conditions under which the carriage is to be performed are such as reasonably to justify a special agreement.

## Article 7

Nothing herein contained shall prevent a carrier or a shipper from entering into any agreement, stipulation, condition, reservation or exemption as to the responsibility and liability of the carrier or the ship for the loss or damage to, or in connection with, the custody and care and handling of goods prior to the loading on, and subsequent to the discharge from the ship on which the goods are carried by sea.

## Chapter III  
Rights of salvors

### Article 12---Conditions for reward
    
*   1 Salvage operations which have had a useful result give right to a reward.

*   2 Except as otherwise provided, no payment is due under this Convention if the salvage operations have had no useful result.

*   3 This chapter shall apply, notwithstanding that the salved vessel and the vessel undertaking the salvage operations belong to the same owner.

### Article 13---Criteria for fixing the reward
    
*   1 The reward shall be fixed with a view to encouraging salvage operations, taking into account the following criteria without regard to the order in which they are presented below:
        
    *   (a) the salved value of the vessel and other property;
    
    *   (b) the skill and efforts of the salvors in preventing or minimizing damage to the environment;
    
    *   (c) the measure of success obtained by the salvor;
    
    *   (d) the nature and degree of the danger;
    
    *   (e) the skill and efforts of the salvors in salving the vessel, other property and life;
    
    *   (f) the time used and expenses and losses incurred by the salvors;
    
    *   (g) the risk of liability and other risks run by the salvors or their equipment;
    
    *   (h) the promptness of the services rendered;
    
    *   (i) the availability and use of vessels or other equipment intended for salvage operations;
    
    *   (j) the state of readiness and efficiency of the salvor's equipment and the value thereof.
    
    

*   2 Payment of a reward fixed according to paragraph 1 shall be made by all of the vessel and other property interests in proportion to their respective salved values. However, a State Party may in its national law provide that the payment of a reward has to be made by one of these interests, subject to a right of recourse of this interest against the other interests for their respective shares. Nothing in this article shall prevent any right of defence.

*   3 The rewards, exclusive of any interest and recoverable legal costs that may be payable thereon, shall not exceed the salved value of the vessel and other property.

### Article 14---Special compensation
    
*   1 If the salvor has carried out salvage operations in respect of a vessel which by itself or its cargo threatened damage to the environment and has failed to earn a reward under article 13 at least equivalent to the special compensation assessable in accordance with this article, he shall be entitled to special compensation from the owner of that vessel equivalent to his expenses as herein defined.

*   2 If, in the circumstances set out in paragraph 1, the salvor by his salvage operations has prevented or minimized damage to the environment, the special compensation payable by the owner to the salvor under paragraph 1 may be increased up to a maximum of 30% of the expenses incurred by the salvor. However, the tribunal, if it deems it fair and just to do so and bearing in mind the relevant criteria set out in article 13, paragraph 1, may increase such special compensation further, but in no event shall the total increase be more than 100% of the expenses incurred by the salvor.

*   3 Salvor's expenses for the purpose of paragraphs 1 and 2 means the out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by the salvor in the salvage operation and a fair rate for equipment and personnel actually and reasonably used in the salvage operation, taking into consideration the criteria set out in article 13, paragraph 1(h), (i) and (j).

*   4 The total special compensation under this article shall be paid only if and to the extent that such compensation is greater than any reward recoverable by the salvor under article 13\.

*   5 If the salvor has been negligent and has thereby failed to prevent or minimize damage to the environment, he may be deprived of the whole or part of any special compensation due under this article.

*   6 Nothing in this article shall affect any right of recourse on the part of the owner of the vessel.

### Article 15---Apportionment between salvors
    
*   1 The apportionment of a reward under article 13 between salvors shall be made on the basis of the criteria contained in that article.

*   2 The apportionment between the owner, master and other persons in the service of each salving vessel shall be determined by the law of the flag of that vessel. If the salvage has not been carried out from a vessel, the apportionment shall be determined by the law governing the contract between the salvor and his servants.

### Article 16---Salvage of persons
    
*   1 No remuneration is due from persons whose lives are saved, but nothing in this article shall affect the provisions of national law on this subject.

*   2 A salvor of human life, who has taken part in the services rendered on the occasion of the accident giving rise to salvage, is entitled to a fair share of the payment awarded to the salvor for salving the vessel or other property or preventing or minimizing damage to the environment.

### Article 17---Services rendered under existing contracts

No payment is due under the provisions of this Convention unless the services rendered exceed what can be reasonably considered as due performance of a contract entered into before the danger arose.

### Article 18---The effect of salvor's misconduct

A salvor may be deprived of the whole or part of the payment due under this Convention to the extent that salvage operations have become necessary or more difficult because of fault or neglect on his part or if the salvor has been guilty of fraud or other dishonest conduct.

### Article 19---Prohibition of salvage operations

Services rendered notwithstanding the express and reasonable prohibition of the owner or master of the vessel or the owner of any other property in danger which is not and has not been on board the vessel shall not give rise to payment under this Convention.

## Chapter IV  
Claims and actions

### Article 20---Maritime lien
    
*   1 Nothing in this Convention shall affect the salvor's maritime lien under any international convention or national law.

### Article 22---Interim payment
    
*   1 The tribunal having jurisdiction over the claim of the salvor may, by interim decision, order that the salvor shall be paid on account such amount as seems fair and just, and on such terms including terms as to security where appropriate, as may be fair and just according to the circumstances of the case.

*   2 The person against whom a claim is made may at any time during the running of the limitation period extend that period by a declaration to the claimant. This period may in the like manner be further extended.

*   3 An action for indemnity by a person liable may be instituted even after the expiration of the limitation period provided for in the preceding paragraphs, if brought within the time allowed by the law of the State where proceedings are instituted.

*   Schedule 6 Article 23 paragraph 2: amended, on 9 June 1999, by [section 38(1)][1187] of the Maritime Transport Amendment Act 1999 (1999 No 68).

THE STATES PARTIES TO THIS CONVENTION,

HAVING RECOGNIZED the desirability of determining by agreement certain uniform rules relating to the limitation of liability for maritime claims,

HAVE DECIDED to conclude a Convention for this purpose and have thereto agreed as follows:

## Chapter I  
The Right of Limitation

### Article 1---Persons entitled to limit liability
    
*   1\. Shipowners and salvors, as hereinafter defined, may limit their liability in accordance with the rules of this Convention for claims set out in Article 2\.

*   2\. The term ""shipowner"" shall mean the owner, charterer, manager and operator of a seagoing ship.

*   3\. Salvor shall mean any person rendering services in direct connexion with salvage operations. Salvage operations shall also include operations referred to in Article 2, paragraph 1(d), (e) and (f).

*   4\. If any claims set out in Article 2 are made against any person for whose act, neglect or default the shipowner or salvor is responsible, such person shall be entitled to avail himself of the limitation of liability provided for in this Convention.

*   5\. In this Convention the liability of a shipowner shall include liability in an action brought against the vessel itself.

*   6\. An insurer of liability for claims subject to limitation in accordance with the rules of this Convention shall be entitled to the benefits of this Convention to the same extent as the assured himself.

*   7\. The act of invoking limitation of liability shall not constitute an admission of liability.

### Article 2---Claims subject to limitation
    
*   1\. Subject to Articles 3 and 4 the following claims, whatever the basis of liability may be, shall be subject to limitation of liability:
        
    *   (a) claims in respect of loss of life or personal injury or loss of or damage to property (including damage to harbour works, basins and waterways and aids to navigation), occurring on board or in direct connexion with the operation of the ship or with salvage operations, and consequential loss resulting therefrom;
    
    *   (b) claims in respect of loss resulting from delay in the carriage by sea of cargo, passengers or their luggage;
    
    *   (c) claims in respect of other loss resulting from infringement of rights other than contractual rights, occurring in direct connexion with the operation of the ship or salvage operations;
    
    *   (d) claims in respect of the raising, removal, destruction or the rendering harmless of a ship which is sunk, wrecked, stranded or abandoned, including anything that is or has been on board such ship;
    
    *   (e) claims in respect of the removal, destruction or the rendering harmless of the cargo of the ship;
    
    *   (f) claims of a person other than the person liable in respect of measures taken in order to avert or minimize loss for which the person liable may limit his liability in accordance with this Convention, and further loss caused by such measures.
    
    

*   2\. Claims set out in paragraph 1 shall be subject to limitation of liability even if brought by way of recourse or for indemnity under a contract or otherwise. However, claims set out under paragraph 1(d), (e) and (f) shall not be subject to limitation of liability to the extent that they relate to remuneration under a contract with the person liable.

### Article 3---Claims excepted from limitation

The rules of this Convention shall not apply to:
    
*   (a) claims for salvage or contribution in general average;

*   (b) claims for oil pollution damage within the meaning of the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, dated 29 November 1969 or of any amendment or Protocol thereto which is in force;

*   (c) claims subject to any international convention or national legislation governing or prohibiting limitation of liability for nuclear damage;

*   (d) claims against the shipowner of a nuclear ship for nuclear damage;

*   (e) claims by servants of the shipowner or salvor whose duties are connected with the ship or the salvage operations, including claims of their heirs, dependants or other persons entitled to make such claims, if under the law governing the contract of service between the shipowner or salvor and such servants the shipowner or salvor is not entitled to limit his liability in respect of such claims, or if he is by such law only permitted to limit his liability to an amount greater than that provided for in Article 6\.

### Article 4---Conduct barring limitation

A person liable shall not be entitled to limit his liability if it is proved that the loss resulted from his personal act or omission, committed with the intent to cause such loss, or recklessly and with knowledge that such loss would probably result.

### Article 5---Counterclaims

Where a person entitled to limitation of liability under the rules of this Convention has a claim against the claimant arising out of the same occurrence, their respective claims shall be set off against each other and the provisions of this Convention shall only apply to the balance, if any.

## Chapter II  
Limits of Liability

### Article 6---The general limits
    
*   1\. The limits of liability for claims other than those mentioned in Article 7, arising on any distinct occasion, shall be calculated as follows:
        
    *   (a) in respect of claims for loss of life or personal injury,
            
        *   (i) 333,000 Units of Account for a ship with a tonnage not exceeding 500 tons,
        
        *   (ii) for a ship with a tonnage in excess thereof, the following amount in addition to that mentioned in (i):
                
            *   for each ton from 501 to 3,000 tons, 500 Units of Account;
            
            *   for each ton from 3,001 to 30,000 tons, 333 Units of Account;
            
            *   for each ton from 30,001 to 70,000 tons, 250 Units of Account; and
            
            *   for each ton in excess of 70,000 tons, 167 Units of Account,
            
            
        
        
    
    *   (b) in respect of any other claims,
            
        *   (i) 167,000 Units of Account for a ship with a tonnage not exceeding 500 tons,
        
        *   (ii) for a ship with a tonnage in excess thereof the following amount in addition to that mentioned in (i):
                
            *   for each ton from 501 to 30,000 tons, 167 Units of Account;
            
            *   for each ton from 30,001 to 70,000 tons, 125 Units of Account; and
            
            *   for each ton in excess of 70,000 tons, 83 Units of Account.
            
            
        
        
    
    

*   2\. Where the amount calculated in accordance with paragraph 1(a) is insufficient to pay the claims mentioned therein in full, the amount calculated in accordance with paragraph 1(b) shall be available for payment of the unpaid balance of claims under paragraph 1(a) and such unpaid balance shall rank rateably with claims mentioned under paragraph 1(b).

*   3\. However, without prejudice to the right of claims for loss of life or personal injury according to paragraph 2, a State Party may provide in its national law that claims in respect of damage to harbour works, basins and waterways and aids to navigation shall have such priority over other claims under paragraph 1(b) as is provided by that law.

*   4\. The limits of liability for any salvor not operating from any ship or for any salvor operating solely on the ship to, or in respect of which he is rendering salvage services, shall be calculated according to a tonnage of 1,500 tons.

*   5\. For the purpose of this Convention the ship's tonnage shall be the gross tonnage calculated in accordance with the tonnage measurement rules contained in Annex I of the International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, 1969\.

### Article 7---The limit for passenger claims
    
*   1\. In respect of claims arising on any distinct occasion for loss of life or personal injury to passengers of a ship, the limit of liability of the shipowner thereof shall be an amount of 46,666 Units of Account multiplied by the number of passengers which the ship is authorized to carry according to the ship's certificate, but not exceeding 25 million Units of Account.

*   2\. For the purpose of this Article ""claims for loss of life or personal injury to passengers of a ship"" shall mean any such claims brought by or on behalf of any person carried in that ship:
        
    *   (a) under a contract of passenger carriage, or
    
    *   (b) who, with the consent of the carrier, is accompanying a vehicle or live animals which are covered by a contract for the carriage of goods.
    
    

### Article 8---Unit of Account
    
*   1\. The Unit of Account referred to in Articles 6 and 7 is the Special Drawing Right as defined by the International Monetary Fund. The amounts mentioned in Articles 6 and 7 shall be converted into the national currency of the State in which limitation is sought, according to the value of that currency at the date the limitation fund shall have been constituted, payment is made, or security is given which under the law of that State is equivalent to such payment. The value of a national currency in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a State Party which is a member of the International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in accordance with the method of valuation applied by the International Monetary Fund in effect at the date in question for its operations and transactions. The value of a national currency in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a State Party which is not a member of the International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in a manner determined by that State Party.

*   2\. Nevertheless, those States which are not members of the International Monetary Fund and whose law does not permit the application of the provisions of paragraph 1 may, at the time of signature without reservation as to ratification, acceptance or approval or at the time of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession or at any time thereafter, declare that the limits of liability provided for in this Convention to be applied in their territories shall be fixed as follows:
        
    *   (a) in respect of Article 6, paragraph 1(a) at an amount of:
            
        *   (i) 5 million monetary units for a ship with a tonnage not exceeding 500 tons,
        
        *   (ii) for a ship with a tonnage in excess thereof, the following amount in addition to that mentioned in (i):
                
            *   for each ton from 501 to 3,000 tons, 7,500 monetary units;
            
            *   for each ton from 3,001 to 30,000 tons, 5,000 monetary units;
            
            *   for each ton from 30,001 to 70,000 tons, 3,750 monetary units; and
            
            *   for each ton in excess of 70,000 tons, 2,500 monetary units; and
            
            
        
        
    
    *   (b) in respect of Article 6, paragraph 1(b), at an amount of:
            
        *   (i) 2.5 million monetary units for a ship with a tonnage not exceeding 500 tons,
        
        *   (ii) for a ship with a tonnage in excess thereof, the following amount in addition to that mentioned in (i): 
                
            *   for each ton from 501 to 30,000 tons, 2,500 monetary units;
            
            *   for each ton from 30,001 to 70,000 tons, 1,850 monetary units; and
            
            *   for each ton in excess of 70,000 tons, 1,250 monetary units; and
            
            
        
        
    
    *   (c) in respect of Article 7, paragraph 1, at an amount of 700,000 monetary units multiplied by the number of passengers which the ship is authorized to carry according to its certificate, but not exceeding 375 million monetary units.
    
    Paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 6 apply correspondingly to sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of this paragraph.

*   3\. The monetary unit referred to in paragraph 2 corresponds to sixty-five and a half milligrammes of gold of millesimal fineness nine hundred. The conversion of the amounts referred to in paragraph 2 into the national currency shall be made according to the law of the State concerned.

*   4\. The calculation mentioned in the last sentence of paragraph 1 and the conversion mentioned in paragraph 3 shall be made in such a manner as to express in the national currency of the State Party as far as possible the same real value for the amounts in Articles 6 and 7 as is expressed there in units of account. States Parties shall communicate to the depositary the manner of calculation pursuant to paragraph 1, or the result of the conversion in paragraph 3, as the case may be, at the time of the signature without reservation as to ratification, acceptance or approval, or when depositing an instrument referred to in Article 16 and whenever there is a change in either.

### Article 9---Aggregation of claims
    
*   1\. The limits of liability determined in accordance with Article 6 shall apply to the aggregate of all claims which arise on any distinct occasion:
        
    *   (a) against the person or persons mentioned in paragraph 2 of Article 1 and any person for whose act, neglect or default he or they are responsible; or
    
    *   (b) against the shipowner of a ship rendering salvage services from that ship and the salvor or salvors operating from such ship and any person for whose act, neglect or default he or they are responsible; or
    
    *   (c) against the salvor or salvors who are not operating from a ship or who are operating solely on the ship to, or in respect of which, the salvage services are rendered and any person for whose act, neglect or default he or they are responsible.
    
    

*   2\. The limits of liability determined in accordance with Article 7 shall apply to the aggregate of all claims subject thereto which may arise on any distinct occasion against the person or persons mentioned in paragraph 2 of Article 1 in respect of the ship referred to in Article 7 and any person for whose act, neglect or default he or they are responsible.

### Article 10---Limitation of liability without constitution of a limitation fund
    
*   1\. Limitation of liability may be invoked notwithstanding that a limitation fund as mentioned in Article 11 has not been constituted. However, a State Party may provide in its national law that, where an action is brought in its Courts to enforce a claim subject to limitation, a person liable may only invoke the right to limit liability if a limitation fund has been constituted in accordance with the provisions of this Convention or is constituted when the right to limit liability is invoked.

*   2\. If limitation of liability is invoked without the constitution of a limitation fund, the provisions of Article 12 shall apply correspondingly.

*   3\. Questions of procedure arising under the rules of this Article shall be decided in accordance with the national law of the State Party in which action is brought.

## Chapter III  
The Limitation Fund

### Article 11---Constitution of the fund
    
*   1\. Any person alleged to be liable may constitute a fund with the Court or other competent authority in any State Party in which legal proceedings are instituted in respect of claims subject to limitation. The fund shall be constituted in the sum of such of the amounts set out in Articles 6 and 7 as are applicable to claims for which that person may be liable, together with interest thereon from the date of the occurrence giving rise to the liability until the date of the constitution of the fund. Any fund thus constituted shall be available only for the payment of claims in respect of which limitation of liability can be invoked.

*   2\. A fund may be constituted, either by depositing the sum, or by producing a guarantee acceptable under the legislation of the State Party where the fund is constituted and considered to be adequate by the Court or other competent authority.

*   3\. A fund constituted by one of the persons mentioned in paragraph 1(a), (b) or (c) or paragraph 2 of Article 9 or his insurer shall be deemed constituted by all persons mentioned in paragraph 1(a), (b) or (c) or paragraph 2, respectively.

### Article 12---Distribution of the fund
    
*   1\. Subject to the provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of Article 6 and of Article 7, the fund shall be distributed among the claimants in proportion to their established claims against the fund.

*   2\. If, before the fund is distributed, the person liable, or his insurer, has settled a claim against the fund such person shall, up to the amount he has paid, acquire by subrogation the rights which the person so compensated would have enjoyed under this Convention.

*   3\. The right of subrogation provided for in paragraph 2 may also be exercised by persons other than those therein mentioned in respect of any amount of compensation which they may have paid, but only to the extent that such subrogation is permitted under the applicable national law.

*   4\. Where the person liable or any other person establishes that he may be compelled to pay, at a later date, in whole or in part any such amount of compensation with regard to which such person would have enjoyed a right of subrogation pursuant to paragraphs 2 and 3 had the compensation been paid before the fund was distributed, the Court or other competent authority of the State where the fund has been constituted may order that a sufficient sum shall be provisionally set aside to enable such person at such later date to enforce his claim against the fund.

### Article 13---Bar to other actions
    
*   1\. Where a limitation fund has been constituted in accordance with Article 11, any person having made a claim against the fund shall be barred from exercising any right in respect of such claim against any other assets of a person by or on behalf of whom the fund has been constituted.

*   2\. After a limitation fund has been constituted in accordance with Article 11, any ship or other property, belonging to a person on behalf of whom the fund has been constituted, which has been arrested or attached within the jurisdiction of a State Party for a claim which may be raised against the fund, or any security given, may be released by order of the Court or other competent authority of such State. However, such release shall always be ordered if the limitation fund has been constituted:
        
    *   (a) at the port where the occurrence took place, or, if it took place out of port, at the first port of call thereafter; or
    
    *   (b) at the port of disembarkation in respect of claims for loss of life or personal injury; or
    
    *   (c) at the port of discharge in respect of damage to cargo; or
    
    *   (d) in the State where the arrest is made.
    
    

*   3\. The rules of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply only if the claimant may bring a claim against the limitation fund before the Court administering that fund and the fund is actually available and freely transferable in respect of that claim.

### Article 14---Governing law

Subject to the provisions of this Chapter the rules relating to the constitution and distribution of a limitation fund, and all rules of procedure in connexion therewith, shall be governed by the law of the State Party in which the fund is constituted.

## Chapter IV

    *   (a) according to the law of that State, ships intended for navigation on inland waterways
    
    *   (b) ships of less than 300 tons.
    
    

*   A State Party which makes use of the option provided for in this paragraph shall inform the depositary of the limits of liability adopted in its national legislation or of the fact that there are none.

*   3\. A State Party may regulate by specific provisions of national law the system of limitation of liability to be applied to claims arising in cases in which interests of persons who are nationals of other States Parties are in no way involved.

*   4\. The Courts of a State Party shall not apply this Convention to ships constructed for, or adapted to, and engaged in, drilling:
        
    *   (a) when that State has established under its national legislation a higher limit of liability than that otherwise provided for in Article 6; or
    
    *   (b) when that State has become party to an international convention regulating the system of liability in respect of such ships.
    
    In a case to which sub-paragraph (a) applies that State Party shall inform the depositary accordingly.

*   5\. This Convention shall not apply to: 
        
    *   (a) air-cushion vehicles;
