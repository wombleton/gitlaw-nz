    _improvements_ on land means, subject to the provisions of subsection (2), all work done or material used at any time on or for the benefit of the land by the expenditure of capital or labour by any owner or lessee thereof in so far as the effect of the work done or material used is to increase the value of the land, and the benefit thereof is unexhausted at the time of valuation; but does not include work done or material used on or for the benefit of the land by the Crown or by any statutory public body, except so far as the work done or material used has been paid for by the owner or lessee by way of direct contribution
    
    _improvements effected by the lessee_ means improvements effected by a lessee during the currency of a subsisting lease or during the currency of any former lease; and includes improvements paid for, purchased, or otherwise acquired by a lessee whether from a former lessee or otherwise

    _unimproved value_ of any land means the sum, exclusive of the value of any indigenous timber trees, which the owner's estate or interest in the land, if unencumbered by any mortgage or other charge thereon, might be expected to realise at the time of valuation if offered for sale on such reasonable terms and conditions as a bona fide seller might be expected to impose, and if no improvements (as hereinbefore defined) had been made on the said land
    
    _Valuation Court_ means the High Court, including the additional members holding office under the [Land Valuation Proceedings Act 1948][93], in the exercise of its jurisdiction under that Act

##### 8 Māori Trustee and lessee may come to agreement outside of provisions of Act
    
*   (1) Nothing in this Act shall be so construed as to limit or affect the right of the Māori Trustee to make any arrangement or agreement with any lessee holding under a subsisting lease for the settlement or discharge of the lessee's rights otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this Act or the terms of the lease, but no lessee shall, in the absence of any such arrangement or agreement, have in respect of his lease any enforceable rights as against the Māori Trustee or the beneficial owners of the land affected by his lease other than those conferred on him by this Act.
    
    (2) Where any subsisting lease is subject to a mortgage, no arrangement or agreement for the settlement or discharge of the lessee's rights shall be made under this section without the consent of the mortgagee.
    
    (3) Nothing in this Act shall prejudicially affect any negotiations in progress at the commencement thereof for the sale and purchase of any vested land, and any such negotiations may be continued and completed as if this Act had not been passed.

##### 9 Agreements for preservation of existing rights
    
*   (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Act, any lessee holding under any subsisting lease which contains a provision conferring on him a right to compensation for improvements may, if his lease expires at any time before 1 April 1955 give notice in writing to the Maori Trustee at any time before 1 March 1955 to the effect that he elects to have his rights determined in accordance with the terms of his lease.
    
    (2) Any lessee holding under any such subsisting lease which expires after 31 March 1955 may give notice in writing to the Maori Trustee to the like effect at any time within 3 months prior to the date of the expiration of his lease:
    
    provided that the lessee shall not be required to give any notice under this subsection before 1 March 1955\.
    
    (3) The Maori Trustee may, within the time prescribed in subsection (1) or subsection (2), as the case may require, give notice in writing to the lessee holding under any such subsisting lease that he requires the rights of the lessee to be determined in accordance with the terms of his lease.
    
    (4) Within 2 months after the date of the receipt by the Maori Trustee of any notice given to him by the lessee under subsection (1) or subsection (2), or within 2 months after the date of the receipt by the lessee of any notice given by the Maori Trustee under subsection (3), the Maori Trustee or the lessee shall, by notice in writing to the lessee or to the Maori Trustee, as the case may require, indicate whether or not he is agreeable to a determination of the lessee's rights in accordance with the terms of the lease. If the Maori Trustee or the lessee, as the case may require, fails to give notice in accordance with the provisions of this subsection within the time limited in that behalf, he shall be deemed to have agreed to a determination of the lessee's rights in accordance with the terms of his lease.
    
    (5) If, in accordance with the provisions of this section, the Maori Trustee and the lessee agree to a determination of the lessee's rights in accordance with his lease, the lessee's right to compensation shall be deemed to be extinguished unless within 6 months after the date of the expiration of his lease, or within such extended period, not exceeding 6 months, as the Maori Land Court may allow, the lessee has applied to the Maori Land Court for an order charging the amount of any unpaid compensation on the land and for the appointment of a receiver for the purpose of enforcing the charge.
    
    (6) The Maori Land Court shall have jurisdiction to make a charging order and to appoint a receiver under subsection (5) of this section, and the provisions of section 33 of the Maori Affairs Act 1953 shall apply to any receiver so appointed.
    
    (7) Where, pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this section, the Maori Trustee and the lessee agree to a determination of the lessee's rights in accordance with his lease, any appointment of a valuer, arbitrator, or umpire theretofore made, or any valuation or arbitration theretofore completed or undertaken, or any order made by the Maori Land Court creating a charge on the land for the value of improvements or appointing a receiver, shall, notwithstanding that the lease may have been extended by statute or otherwise, and notwithstanding that the appointment, valuation, arbitration, or order was made before the commencement of this Act, subsist for the purpose for which it was made unless the Maori Trustee and the lessee otherwise agree. Where the Maori Trustee and the lessee otherwise agree, the appointment, valuation, arbitration, or order, as the case may require, shall become null and void, and the Maori Land Court, on application made to it in that behalf, may cancel any order made by it in the premises.
    
    (8) Before giving any notice to any lessee under subsection (3) or before making, under [section 8][14], any arrangement or agreement with any lessee for the settlement or discharge of the lessee's rights otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this Act, the Maori Trustee shall, so far as is practicable, ascertain the wishes of the beneficial owners of the land affected by the lease and shall act in accordance with those wishes.
    
    (9) Where any subsisting lease is subject to a mortgage, no agreement for the determination of the lessee's rights in accordance with the terms of his lease shall be made under this section without the consent of the mortgagee.

##### 10 Land Valuation Tribunal to determine disputes
    
*   Where in respect of any subsisting lease any dispute arises between the lessee and the Māori Trustee as to the existence in the lessee of any right to compensation for improvements, or as to the extent of any such right, or as to the nature and kind of improvements in respect of which the lessee has any such right, the lessee or the Māori Trustee may refer the dispute to the Land Valuation Tribunal for determination, and that Tribunal shall have exclusive jurisdiction, in accordance with the provisions of this Act, to determine the dispute accordingly.
