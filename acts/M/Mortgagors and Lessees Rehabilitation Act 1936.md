    (2) Where any mortgage in respect of which a notice has been filed as aforesaid has before the passing of this Act ceased to be subject to the Rural Mortgagors Final Adjustment Act 1934-35 an application relating to that mortgage may be filed under section [29][37] or under section [30][38] of this Act.

    Provided that the Court may at any time, if it thinks fit, direct that any application shall be dealt with by the Court without reference to an Adjustment Commission, or that any application that has been referred to an Adjustment Commission, or any specified matter in relation to any such application, shall be dealt with by the Court.
    
    (2) Unless the Court otherwise directs, the Adjustment Commission to which any matter is referred as aforesaid shall be the Commission usually exercising its functions under this Act in the locality in which the property, the subject-matter of the mortgage or lease to which the application relates, is situated.

##### 38 Adjustment Commission to determine whether or not applicant is a farmer applicant, or a home applicant, the value of his property, the basic rent of his leasehold property, and whether he is entitled to retain property
    
*   (1) In so far it may be necessary in order to enable an adjustment to be made of the liabilities of any applicant the Adjustment Commission shall make an order determining---
        
    *   (a) Whether the applicant is a farmer applicant, or is a home applicant, or is neither a farmer applicant nor a home applicant:
    
    *   (b) The value of any property of the applicant other than his interests (if any) in any farm lands:
    
    *   (c) The basic value of the applicant's interests (if any) in any farm land:
    
    *   (d) The basic rent of any property held by the applicant as lessee under any lease:

    *   (f) The amount of principal and other money secured on any property of the applicant by any adjustable security, after allowing for any remissions made under subsection [(3)][47] of this section.
    
    (2) In determining the value of any property of any applicant other than his interest (if any) in any farm lands, the Adjustment Commission shall have regard to the values subsisting at the passing of this Act, but shall make such increases or reductions in those values as it deems necessary in order to make them fair values to serve as a basis for the adjustment of the liabilities of the applicant in accordance with this Part of this Act.
    
    (3) In determining the amount secured by any adjustable security the Adjustment Commission shall take into account (in addition to all other amounts properly included therein) all interest that has accrued due before the date of the order and has not been remitted under this subsection or under any other enactment. The Adjustment Commission may remit the whole or any part of any interest accrued due before the date of the order (whether or not it has been capitalised), or the whole or any part of any additional charge of 10 percent added to any rates pursuant to section 71 of the Rating Act 1967\.

    (2) In determining whether it is necessary to make any increase or reduction in the productive value as aforesaid the Adjustment Commission shall consider the nature and extent of the applicant's interest in the lands, the extent (if any) to which the productive capacity of the farm can be increased by the applicant, and such other matters affecting the farm property as it considers relevant.
    
    (3) For the purposes of this Part of this Act the productive value of any farm lands shall be deemed to be an amount equal to the net annual income that can be derived from the lands by the average efficient farmer, capitalised at a rate to be fixed for the purpose pursuant to the provisions in that behalf of subsection [(6)][48] hereof.
    
    (4) In order to ascertain the net annual income referred to in the last preceding subsection, there shall be deducted from the gross income that can be derived from the lands as aforesaid all expenses, other than capital expenditure, required to be incurred in the production of such income. The amount of the gross income aforesaid shall be determined on the basis of such prices for farm products as may be fixed for the purposes of this section by the Governor-General by Order in Council, or, in default of any such Order in Council or in so far as any such Order in Council does not extend, by the Court. The said prices shall be fixed after taking into consideration the prices received in respect of products of the same or approximately the same kind, grade, and quality produced in New Zealand during a period of from 8 to 10 years immediately prior to the 31st day of July 1935\. The Governor-General may from time to time, by Order in Council, fix prices for the purposes of this section as hereinbefore provided.
    
    (5) For the purposes of the last preceding subsection the expenses required to be incurred in the production of the income shall be deemed to include (in addition to all other amounts properly included therein) rates and taxes, reasonable remuneration for the work performed by the applicant or any other person in the production of the income, and interest on the average annual value of the stock and chattels required to be used in the farming operations, computed at a rate to be fixed for the purpose pursuant to the provisions in that behalf of the next succeeding subsection.
    
    (6) The Governor-General may from time to time, by Order in Council, fix the rate at which income is to be capitalised for the purposes of subsection [(3)][48] hereof, and the rate at which interest is to be computed for the purposes of the last preceding subsection.

##### 40 Basic rent
    
*   (1) For the purposes of this Part of this Act the basic rent of any property means such rent as in the opinion of the Adjustment Commission is a fair rent to serve as a basis for the adjustment of the liabilities of the applicant in accordance with this Part of this Act.
    
    (2) In determining the basic rent of any property the Adjustment Commission shall have regard to the value of the property, or in the case of farm lands the productive value of the lands as ascertained under the last preceding section, the value of the lessee's interest (if any) in the improvements on the property, and all other relevant considerations.

##### 41 Method of determining whether applicant is entitled to retain farm lands or other property
    
*   (1) In determining whether or not any farmer applicant is entitled to retain his farm lands or any part thereof, the Adjustment Commission shall take into consideration the following matters, namely:
        
    *   (a) The conduct of the applicant in relation to the care and management of the lands and the disbursement of his income:
    
    *   (b) The extent (if any) to which the area of the farm lands exceeds or is less than the area required to enable the applicant to obtain a reasonable standard of comfort for himself and his family:
    
    *   (c) Whether any relief granted pursuant to this Act would be reasonably likely to enable the applicant to meet his future liabilities in respect of the farm lands:
    
    *   (d) Any other matters that it deems relevant.
    
    (2) In determining whether or not any applicant is entitled to retain any property (not being farm lands), that is subject to an adjustable security or is comprised in an adjustable lease, or any part of the property, the Adjustment Commission shall take into consideration the following matters, namely:
        
    *   (a) The conduct of the applicant in relation to the care of the property and the disbursement of his income:
    
    *   (b) Whether any relief granted pursuant to this Act would be reasonably likely to enable the applicant to meet his future liabilities in respect of the property:
    
    *   (c) Any other matters that it deems relevant.
    
    

##### 42 Money secured on farm lands or other property to be reduced to value of security, and balance to be an adjustable debt
    
*   (1) Subject to subsection [(3)][51] of this section, if the basic value of any applicant's interest in any farm lands is less than the total amount of the principal and other money secured on his interest in those lands by any adjustable security or adjustable securities, as determined by the Adjustment Commission, the amount so secured shall be deemed to be reduced to an amount equal to the basic value.
    
    (2) Subject to the next succeeding subsection, if the value as determined by the Adjustment Commission of any property of any applicant (other than his farm lands, if any) is less than the total amount of the principal and other money secured on that property by any adjustable security or adjustable securities, as determined by the Adjustment Commission, the amount so secured shall be deemed to be reduced to an amount equal to the value of that property as aforesaid.
    
    (3) Nothing in the foregoing provisions of this section shall apply with respect to any property that is sold under section [46][55] or section [47][56] of this Act, or in respect of any property to which section [48][57] of this Act applies.
    
    (4) If different portions of the applicant's property (including his farm lands, if any) are subject to different adjustable securities, the foregoing provisions of this section shall apply with respect to each portion separately.
    
    (5) If there is more than one adjustable security on the same property the total amount deemed to be secured thereby shall for the purposes of this section be appropriated to the several securities in the order of their priority so that the first security shall be satisfied in full before any amount is appropriated to the second security, and so on.
    
    (6) The reduction effected by the operation of this section in the amount secured by any adjustable security shall take effect on a date to be specified in that behalf by an order of the Adjustment Commission. The date so specified may be earlier or later than the date of the order of the Adjustment Commission.
    
    (7) The amount by which any adjustable security is reduced in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this section shall be deemed to be a debt due by the applicant to the person entitled to the security, and, except to the extent (if any) to which it may be otherwise secured, shall be deemed to be an adjustable debt, and the provisions of section [49][58] of this Act shall apply accordingly with respect to that amount.

##### 43 Variation of terms of repayment and other terms of adjustable securities
    
*   (1) For the purpose of giving effect to the provisions of this section and the other provisions of this Act the Adjustment Commission may make such orders as it thinks fit, having regard to the general purposes specified in section [2][2] of this Act, for the variation of the terms and conditions of any adjustable security or for the substitution of a new security for any adjustable security, whether or not the amount secured by the adjustable security has been reduced by the operation of the last preceding section.
    
    (2) The whole or any part of the amount secured by any adjustable security, whether or not it is a table mortgage, may be made repayable by instalments of principal and interest as under a table mortgage, payable at such regular intervals and throughout such period as may be specified in that behalf by an order of the Adjustment Commission. The period so specified may commence earlier or later than the date of the order.
    
    (3) Where the amount secured on any land has been reduced by the operation of the last preceding section, so much of the reduced amount as is secured by mortgage and is not to be repayable by instalments of principal and interest as under a table mortgage shall be repayable as follows---that is to say, as to a sum to be specified in that behalf by an order of the Adjustment Commission, at the expiration of 5 years from the date on which the reduction took effect, and as to the balance, on such later date as the Adjustment Commission thinks fit. The sum so specified to be repayable at the expiration of the said period of 5 years shall not exceed such amount as, in the opinion of the Adjustment Commission, the mortgagor will then be able to borrow on first mortgage of the land on reasonable terms; and the terms of the mortgage or mortgages (as varied in accordance with this section), or of any new mortgage or mortgages given pursuant to this section, may provide that the mortgagor shall be entitled to borrow the whole or any part of the sum so specified on first mortgage of the land, and to give a second mortgage or, if necessary, 2 or more subsequent mortgages for so much of the reduced amount secured on the land as remains owing after the said sum has been repaid.
    
    (4) The interest payable on any adjustable security (or on any new security given pursuant to this section) in respect of any period after a date to be specified in that behalf by an order of the Adjustment Commission shall not exceed the appropriate rate of interest to be prescribed for the purpose pursuant to the provisions in that behalf of the next succeeding subsection. The date so specified may be earlier or later than the date of the order of the Adjustment Commission.

    (7) The terms of any adjustable security (as varied in accordance with this section), or of any new security given pursuant to this section, may provide for the repayment of the money secured thereby in the event of the sale or transfer, before the date fixed for repayment, of the property that is subject to the security.
    
    (8) For the purpose of better enabling the owner of any property to pay the amount secured on the property by any adjustable charge or, in the case of any leasehold property, to pay any arrears of rent, the Adjustment Commission may make such orders as it thinks fit for the postponement, capitalisation, reduction, or remission of any interest payable or to become payable under any mortgage of the property, whether in respect of a period before or after the date of the order.
    
    (9) Subject to the foregoing provisions of this section, the terms and conditions of every adjustable security (as varied in accordance with this section), or of any security substituted therefor as provided in subsection [(1)][52] hereof, shall be such as the Adjustment Commission thinks fit.
    
    (10) Nothing in this section shall be construed to render it obligatory on the Adjustment Commission to make an order for the variation of any term or condition of a mortgage unless that term or condition is less favourable to the mortgagor than the corresponding term or condition (if any) specified in this section.

##### 44 Rent payable under any adjustable lease to be reduced to basic rent, and arrears of rent to be an adjustable debt

The period so specified may commence before or after the date of the order of the Adjustment Commission.
    
    (2) The amount of rent owing by any applicant under any adjustable lease up to a date to be specified in that behalf by an order of the Adjustment Commission shall be deemed to be a debt due by the applicant to the lessor, and, except to the extent (if any) to which it may be otherwise secured, shall be deemed to be an adjustable debt, and the provisions of section [49][58] of this Act shall apply accordingly with respect to that amount. The date so specified may be earlier or later than the date of the order of the Adjustment Commission.

##### 45 Variation of provisions of adjustable leases
    
*   For the purpose of giving effect to the provisions of this Act the Adjustment Commission may make such orders as it thinks fit, having regard to the general purposes specified in section [2][2] hereof, for the variation of the provisions of any adjustable lease, whether or not the rent payable under the adjustable lease is reduced under the last preceding section.

##### 46 Adjustment Commission may order sale of any property of applicant in certain cases
    
*   (1) The Adjustment Commission may make such orders as it thinks fit for the sale or offering for sale, on such terms and conditions as the Commission may fix in that behalf, either by public auction or public tender, with a right for any mortgagee to become the purchaser, or by private contract, whether to any specified mortgagee, creditor, or other person, or otherwise howsoever,---
        
    *   (a) Of any property of any applicant that is subject to an adjustable security or is comprised in an adjustable lease, if the Adjustment Commission has determined that the applicant shall not be entitled to retain the property, or if the applicant has elected not to retain the property or has abandoned the property:

    (2) If the net proceeds of the sale of any property under this section are not sufficient to pay the total amount (if any) secured on that property by any adjustable security, the amount remaining unpaid shall be deemed to be a debt due by the applicant to the person entitled to the security, and, except to the extent (if any) to which it may be otherwise secured, shall be deemed to be an adjustable debt, and the provisions of section [49][58] of this Act shall apply accordingly with respect to that amount.

##### 47 Right of vendor-mortgagee to repurchase property at same price, subject to allowances for improvements and depreciation

    (3) If the net proceeds of the sale of any property under this section are not sufficient to pay the total amount secured on that property by any adjustable security, the amount remaining unpaid shall be deemed to be a debt due by the applicant to the person entitled to the security, and, except to the extent (if any) to which it may be otherwise secured, shall be deemed to be an adjustable debt, and the provisions of section [49][58] of this Act shall apply accordingly with respect to that amount.

    Provided that where the applicant has no assets available for the payment or satisfaction of any adjustable debt, no order shall be made for the payment or satisfaction of that debt unless the Adjustment Commission deems it just and equitable to make such an order, after taking into consideration the amount of the income of the applicant, any hardship that would be inflicted on the creditor by failure to make the order, and all other relevant matters.

    *   (d) Providing for the borrowing of money on the security of any property of the applicant, to be applied in or towards the satisfaction of any adjustable debts:

    (2) Where the person by whom any money has been so advanced or to whom any debts have been so incurred during any farming season is a creditor of the applicant in respect of any other money, the last preceding subsection shall apply only with respect to so much of the amount of the money so advanced or of the debts so incurred as exceeds the total amount received by the creditor during that farming season in respect of any of the applicant's liabilities to him.

    (2) The owner of any such chattel may at any time apply to the Adjustment Commission for authority to terminate the agreement or to remove the chattel from the possession of the applicant, and the Adjustment Commission shall give such authority except in cases where in its opinion the chattel is required by the applicant for the purposes of his farming operations.
    
    (3) If in the opinion of the Adjustment Commission the chattel is required by the applicant for the purposes of his farming operations, the Adjustment Commission may refuse to consent to the termination of the agreement or the removal of the chattel and may from time to time make such orders as it deems just and equitable for the variation of the agreement, or may at any time order that the agreement be terminated and that the chattel be returned to the owner upon such terms and conditions as the Adjustment Commission thinks fit.

An application for any such extension may be made at any time (whether before or after the service of the notice) not later than the said 31st day of January 1937\.
