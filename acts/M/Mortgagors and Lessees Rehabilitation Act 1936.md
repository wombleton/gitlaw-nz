    *   (a) whether the applicant is a farmer applicant, or is a home applicant, or is neither a farmer applicant nor a home applicant:

    (2) In determining the value of any property of any applicant other than his interest (if any) in any farm lands, the Adjustment Commission shall have regard to the values subsisting at the passing of this Act, but shall make such increases or reductions in those values as it deems necessary in order to make them fair values to serve as a basis for the adjustment of the liabilities of the applicant in accordance with this Part.

    *   (a) the conduct of the applicant in relation to the care of the property and the disbursement of his income:

    (2) Subject to the next succeeding subsection, if the value as determined by the Adjustment Commission of any property of any applicant (other than his farm lands, if any) is less than the total amount of the principal and other moneys secured on that property by any adjustable security or adjustable securities, as determined by the Adjustment Commission, the amount so secured shall be deemed to be reduced to an amount equal to the value of that property determined as aforesaid.

    (5) If there is more than 1 adjustable security on the same property the total amount deemed to be secured thereby shall for the purposes of this section be appropriated to the several securities in the order of their priority so that the first security shall be satisfied in full before any amount is appropriated to the second security, and so on.
    
    (6) The reduction effected by the operation of this section in the amount secured by any adjustable security shall take effect on a date to be specified in that behalf by an order of the Adjustment Commission. The date so specified may be earlier or later than the date of the order of the Adjustment Commission.
    
    (7) The amount by which any adjustable security is reduced in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this section shall be deemed to be a debt due by the applicant to the person entitled to the security, and, except to the extent (if any) to which it may be otherwise secured, shall be deemed to be an adjustable debt, and the provisions of [section 49][59] shall apply accordingly with respect to that amount.

##### 43 Variation of terms of repayment and other terms of adjustable securities
    
*   (1) For the purpose of giving effect to the provisions of this section and the other provisions of this Act the Adjustment Commission may make such orders as it thinks fit, having regard to the general purposes specified in [section 2][3], for the variation of the terms and conditions of any adjustable security or for the substitution of a new security for any adjustable security, whether or not the amount secured by the adjustable security has been reduced by the operation of the last preceding section.
    
    (2) The whole or any part of the amount secured by any adjustable security, whether or not it is a table mortgage, may be made repayable by instalments of principal and interest as under a table mortgage, payable at such regular intervals and throughout such period as may be specified in that behalf by an order of the Adjustment Commission. The period so specified may commence earlier or later than the date of the order.

The sum so specified to be repayable at the expiration of the said period of 5 years shall not exceed such amount as, in the opinion of the Adjustment Commission, the mortgagor will then be able to borrow on first mortgage of the land on reasonable terms; and the terms of the mortgage or mortgages (as varied in accordance with this section), or of any new mortgage or mortgages given pursuant to this section, may provide that the mortgagor shall be entitled to borrow the whole or any part of the sum so specified on first mortgage of the land, and to give a second mortgage or, if necessary, 2 or more subsequent mortgages for so much of the reduced amount secured on the land as remains owing after the said sum has been repaid.
    
    (4) The interest payable on any adjustable security (or on any new security given pursuant to this section) in respect of any period after a date to be specified in that behalf by an order of the Adjustment Commission shall not exceed the appropriate rate of interest to be prescribed for the purpose pursuant to the provisions in that behalf of the next succeeding subsection. The date so specified may be earlier or later than the date of the order of the Adjustment Commission.

    (8) For the purpose of better enabling the owner of any property to pay the amount secured on the property by any adjustable charge or, in the case of any leasehold property, to pay any arrears of rent, the Adjustment Commission may make such orders as it thinks fit for the postponement, capitalisation, reduction, or remission of any interest payable or to become payable under any mortgage of the property, whether in respect of a period before or after the date of the order.
    
    (9) Subject to the foregoing provisions of this section, the terms and conditions of every adjustable security (as varied in accordance with this section), or of any security substituted therefor as provided in subsection (1), shall be such as the Adjustment Commission thinks fit.
    
    (10) Nothing in this section shall be construed to render it obligatory on the Adjustment Commission to make an order for the variation of any term or condition of a mortgage unless that term or condition is less favourable to the mortgagor than the corresponding term or condition (if any) specified in this section.

##### 44 Rent payable under any adjustable lease to be reduced to basic rent, and arrears of rent to be an adjustable debt

The period so specified may commence before or after the date of the order of the Adjustment Commission.
    
    (2) The amount of rent owing by any applicant under any adjustable lease up to a date to be specified in that behalf by an order of the Adjustment Commission shall be deemed to be a debt due by the applicant to the lessor, and, except to the extent (if any) to which it may be otherwise secured, shall be deemed to be an adjustable debt, and the provisions of [section 49][59] shall apply accordingly with respect to that amount.

    *   (a) of any property of any applicant that is subject to an adjustable security or is comprised in an adjustable lease, if the Adjustment Commission has determined that the applicant shall not be entitled to retain the property, or if the applicant has elected not to retain the property or has abandoned the property:
    
    *   (b) in the case of a farmer applicant, of any other property, if the Adjustment Commission considers that its sale is desirable for the purposes of the adjustment of the liabilities of the applicant.
    
    (2) If the net proceeds of the sale of any property under this section are not sufficient to pay the total amount (if any) secured on that property by any adjustable security, the amount remaining unpaid shall be deemed to be a debt due by the applicant to the person entitled to the security, and, except to the extent (if any) to which it may be otherwise secured, shall be deemed to be an adjustable debt, and the provisions of [section 49][59] shall apply accordingly with respect to that amount.

    (3) If the net proceeds of the sale of any property under this section are not sufficient to pay the total amount secured on that property by any adjustable security, the amount remaining unpaid shall be deemed to be a debt due by the applicant to the person entitled to the security, and, except to the extent (if any) to which it may be otherwise secured, shall be deemed to be an adjustable debt, and the provisions of [section 49][59] shall apply accordingly with respect to that amount.
    
    (4) In any case where a mortgagee who is entitled to purchase any property under this section does not do so, nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the powers conferred on the Adjustment Commission by the last preceding section.
    
    (5) Where the mortgagees under 2 or more mortgages desire to purchase any property under this section, preference shall be given to the mortgagee under the mortgage that was last registered.

##### 48 Moneys secured on property that is abandoned to be an adjustable debt

    (2) Unless the Adjustment Commission otherwise orders, where at the date of adjustment the creditor in respect of any adjustable debt to which any applicant is subject is himself subject to any liability, present or future, certain or contingent, in favour of the applicant, the adjustable debt and the creditor's liability may be set off one against the other, and the last preceding subsection shall apply only with respect to the excess (if any) of the adjustable debt over the amount of the creditor's liability.
    
    (3) The Adjustment Commission may make such orders as it thinks fit, having regard to the general purposes specified in [section 2][3], and to the other provisions of this Act, and to the circumstances in which the debts were contracted, and to all other relevant considerations, for the payment or satisfaction in whole or in part of the adjustable debts of any applicant, whether or not he continues in the use and occupation of his property or of any part thereof:
    
    provided that where the applicant has no assets available for the payment or satisfaction of any adjustable debt, no order shall be made for the payment or satisfaction of that debt unless the Adjustment Commission deems it just and equitable to make such an order, after taking into consideration the amount of the income of the applicant, any hardship that would be inflicted on the creditor by failure to make the order, and all other relevant matters.
    
    (4) In particular, without limiting the general power hereinbefore conferred, orders may be made under this section for all or any of the following purposes:

    *   (d) providing for the borrowing of money on the security of any property of the applicant, to be applied in or towards the satisfaction of any adjustable debts:
    
    *   (e) providing for the application of any property of the applicant in its existing form in or towards the satisfaction of any adjustable debts:

    (2) The owner of any such chattel may at any time apply to the Adjustment Commission for authority to terminate the agreement or to remove the chattel from the possession of the applicant, and the Adjustment Commission shall give such authority except in cases where in its opinion the chattel is required by the applicant for the purposes of his farming operations.
    
    (3) If in the opinion of the Adjustment Commission the chattel is required by the applicant for the purposes of his farming operations, the Adjustment Commission may refuse to consent to the termination of the agreement or the removal of the chattel and may from time to time make such orders as it deems just and equitable for the variation of the agreement, or may at any time order that the agreement be terminated and that the chattel be returned to the owner upon such terms and conditions as the Adjustment Commission thinks fit.
    
    (4) For the purposes of this section the term _owner_ in relation to any chattel means the vendor or bailor of that chattel within the meaning of section 57 of the Chattels Transfer Act 1924\.

##### 54 Adjustment of liability of applicant under guarantee
    
*   (1) The liability or obligation of any applicant under any guarantee in respect of an adjustable mortgage or adjustable lease shall, except to the extent (if any) to which it may be otherwise secured, be deemed to be an adjustable debt, and the provisions of [section 49][59] shall apply accordingly with respect thereto.

    (3) Where an order of the court affects any estate or interest in land that is subject to the Land Transfer Act 1915, or affects any other property that is subject to an Act providing that registration is necessary to give effect to dealings with the legal title thereto, the order, until it is registered in accordance with this section, shall affect only the equitable title to the property.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Mortgagors and Lessees Rehabilitation Act 1936\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 July 2013, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][119] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][120] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][121] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][122] and [17E][123] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
