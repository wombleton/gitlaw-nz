*   #### Preamble
    
    (1) By the [Treaty of Waitangi][328], the Queen of England confirmed and guaranteed to the chiefs, tribes, and individual Maori the full, exclusive, and undisturbed possession of their fisheries for so long as they wished to retain them:
    
    (2) Maori claimed in proceedings in the High Court and in various claims to the Waitangi Tribunal that the quota management system introduced by the Fisheries Amendment Act 1986 was unlawful and in breach of the principles of the [Treaty of Waitangi][328], or had no application to Maori fisheries (including commercial fisheries):
    
    (3) In legal proceedings, Maori obtained from the High Court and the Court of Appeal, by way of interim relief, a declaration that the Crown ought not to take further steps to bring the fisheries within the quota management system:
    
    (4) The Maori Fisheries Act 1989 was enacted to make better provision for the recognition of Maori commercial fishing rights secured by the [Treaty of Waitangi][328]. The Act provided that the Maori Fisheries Commission was to be provided with 10% of all quota holdings then subject to the quota management system, or the equivalent value in cash as compensation for commercial fishing claims:
    
    (5) A Deed of Settlement dated 23 September 1992 was entered into between the Crown and representatives of the New Zealand Maori Council, the National Maori Congress, and iwi:
    
    (6) In that Deed of Settlement it was agreed that the settlement (which was ultimately for the benefit of all Maori), the implementation in legislation of the agreements made in that Deed, and the continuing relationship between the Crown and Maori, would constitute a full and final settlement of all Maori claims to commercial fishing rights:
    
    (7) The [Treaty of Waitangi (Fisheries Claims) Settlement Act 1992][329], an Act ""to give effect to the settlement of claims relating to Maori fishing rights"", provided for the implementation of the Deed of Settlement through the following means:
        
    *   (a) reconstitution of the Maori Fisheries Commission as the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission; and
    
    *   (b) payment by the Crown to the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission of a sum of $150 million to be used for the development and involvement of Maori in the New Zealand fishing industry, including participation in a joint venture with Brierley Investments Limited to acquire Sealord Products Limited, a major fishing company; and
    
    *   (c) provision for the allocation to the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission of 20% of quota for any new quota management stocks brought within the quota management system; and
    
    *   (d) provision for the making of regulations to recognise and provide for customary food gathering by Maori; and
    
    *   (e) empowerment of the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission to allocate the assets held by the Maori Fisheries Commission at the settlement date specified in the Deed of Settlement, after considering how best to give effect to the resolutions adopted by the Annual General Meeting of the Maori Fisheries Commission on 25 July 1992 and reporting to the Minister of Fisheries for approval of that scheme of allocation; and
    
    *   (f) empowerment of the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission, after full consultation with Maori, to develop and report to the Minister on proposals for a new Maori Fisheries Act that would provide---
            
        *   (i) a scheme for identifying the beneficiaries and their interests under the Deed of Settlement; and
        
        *   (ii) a procedure to allocate the assets of the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission (other than those held prior to the signing of that Deed):
        
        
    
    (8) The Crown, through the provisions of the [Fisheries Act 1996][330], allocates to the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission 20% of quota for any new quota management stocks brought within the quota management system:
    
    (9) The Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission, having considered its duties under the Maori Fisheries Act 1989 and the Deed of Settlement, has examined alternative methods for allocating its assets, produced discussion material, and consulted with iwi and Maori on the allocation of the assets referred to in Schedule 1A of the Maori Fisheries Act 1989:
    
    (10) In 1998 the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission developed an ""optimum model"" for allocation. The bases for that model have been challenged in successive court actions and overall have been found to have been consistent with the intent of the Deed of Settlement:
    
    (11) The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, in _Te Waka Hi Ika o Te Arawa v Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission_ \[2002\] 2 NZLR 17, held that the obligations of the trust imposed by the Deed of Settlement required the benefits of the settlement to be allocated to iwi, meaning the traditional tribes, for the ultimate benefit of all Maori:
    
    (12) Subsequently, the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission considered and took into account the findings of the courts as to its duties under the Maori Fisheries Act 1989 and the Deed of Settlement. It examined alternative methods for allocating its assets, produced further consultation material, consulted with iwi and Maori, and after undertaking additional processes to reach agreement on the model, considered that it had secured the maximum possible support for its allocation proposals:
    
    (13) In May 2003, the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission reported to the Minister of Fisheries on its proposal for the allocation of the assets it held on the settlement date specified in the Deed of Settlement: _He Kawai Amokura: A model for allocation of the Fisheries Settlement Assets: Report to the Minister of Fisheries_:
    
    (14) The Minister of Fisheries assessed the proposal of the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission, in accordance with the requirements of the Maori Fisheries Act 1989 and the Deed of Settlement, and considered the proposal to be consistent with those requirements. He therefore agreed to incorporate the proposal in legislation:
    
    (15) The enactment of this legislation will complete implementation of the agreements in the Deed of Settlement between the Crown and Maori in respect of Maori claims to commercial fisheries, as outlined in the Preamble to that Deed and in the [Preamble][331] of the Treaty of Waitangi (Fisheries Claims) Settlement Act 1992\.

### Subpart 2---Key concepts

#### Classification of deepwater and inshore quota

##### 7 Classification of new quota
    
*   (1) If the responsible Minister declares under [section 18][335] of the Fisheries Act 1996 that a stock is subject to the quota management system, Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Limited must, within 6 months of the notification of that declaration,---
        
    *   (a) determine the appropriate classification for the stock in accordance with [sections 8][13] and [9][14]; and
    
    *   (b) in accordance with [section 8][13], determine, for every harbour specified in [Schedule 2][320] that is within the relevant quota management area, either---
            
        *   (i) the quantity of harbour quota for the stock; or
        
        *   (ii) that there is no harbour quota for the stock; and
        
        
    
    *   (c) publish in the _Gazette_---
            
        *   (i) the classification of the stock; and
        
        *   (ii) whether harbour quota applies to that stock; and

##### 8 Basis for classifying stock under section 7
    
*   (1) For the purpose of classifying stock under [section 7][12], a stock for which Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Limited determines, on the basis of scientific or anecdotal evidence, that the commercial catch during the 5 fishing years prior to the declaration referred to in section 7(1) was entirely taken---
        
    *   (a) at depths greater than 400 m from the surface, must be classified as deepwater:
    
    *   (b) at depths less than 200 m from the surface, must be classified as inshore:
    
    *   (c) in freshwater, must be classified as freshwater.
    
    (2) For each stock, if any commercial catch was taken during the 5 fishing years prior to the declaration referred to in [section 7(1)][12] in any of the harbours listed in [Schedule 2][320], Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Limited must determine a harbour quota.
    
    (3) In relation to each harbour listed in [Schedule 2][320], the proportion of the available settlement quota that is to be classified as harbour quota for each stock must be the proportion of the total commercial catch of that stock taken in that harbour in the fishing year with the highest commercial catch in that harbour during the 5 fishing years prior to the declaration referred to in [section 7(1)][12].
    
    (4) Harbour quota is calculated under subsection (3) in accordance with the following formula:
    
    Harbour quota for the listed harbour = a × c 
    
    b 
    
    where---
    
    **a**
    > 
    > is the highest commercial catch of a stock in a listed harbour in a fishing year during the 5 fishing years prior to the declaration referred to in [section 7(1)][12]
    
    **b**
    > 
    > is the total commercial catch of that stock in that year
    
    **c**
    > 
    > is the available settlement quota.
    
    

##### 9 Alternative basis for classification of new quota

##### 20 Withdrawal of group from joint mandated iwi organisation
    
*   (1) In addition to the matters required for the constitutional documents of a mandated iwi organisation under [section 17][25], the constitutional documents of a joint mandated iwi organisation must provide,---
        
    *   (a) in the cases of the iwi of Hauraki and the iwi of Te Arawa, for any iwi to withdraw, if it so chooses, from the relevant joint mandated iwi organisation; and

    (2) The constitutional documents of each joint mandated iwi organisation must also provide---
        
    *   (a) the process that a withdrawing group must undertake in order to withdraw, including giving notice of its intention to withdraw to---
            
        *   (i) Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Limited; and
        
        *   (ii) the relevant joint mandated iwi organisation; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) the process for determining, consistently with the provisions of [Part 3][185], the matters set out in subsection (3); and
    
    *   (c) the criteria that must be met by the withdrawing group in order to complete the process of withdrawal, including having a mandated iwi organisation recognised by Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Limited in accordance with [section 13(1)][21].
    
    (3) The matters that must be determined by the process provided for under subsection (2)(b) are---
        
    *   (a) the amount of the notional iwi population specified in column 2 of [Schedule 3][321] for an iwi that must, in each case, be attributed to any withdrawing group; and
    
    *   (b) the division of settlement assets that must be made between the joint mandated iwi organisation and a withdrawing group, including the proportion that the withdrawing group is entitled to receive of---

            *   (A) under [sections 36(1)(f)(ii)][59], [43][66], [84(1)(g)][123], and [96(1)(g)][141]; and
            
            *   (B) as a consequence of the allocation and transfer of settlement assets under [subparts 1][187] and [2][204] of Part 3, including quota shares in respect of new species introduced into the quota management system and transferred to Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Limited under [section 44][332] of the Fisheries Act 1996\.
            
            
        
        
    
    (4) In determining the amount of the notional iwi population to be attributed to a withdrawing group under subsection (3)(a) and the proportion of the settlement assets that a withdrawing group must receive under subsection (3)(b), a joint mandated iwi organisation and a withdrawing group may use any relevant information, including the relevant data from the census of 2001 or 2006 (but no other census data).
    
    (5) If a withdrawing group chooses to withdraw from its joint mandated iwi organisation, it must commence the process of withdrawal, in accordance with the process provided for under subsection (2)(a), not later than 5 years after the recognition of the relevant joint mandated iwi organisation under [section 13(1)][21].

##### 21 Recognition of mandated iwi organisation of withdrawing group
    
*   (1) Despite [section 13(2)][21], if a withdrawing group notifies in accordance with [section 20(2)(a)][37] its intention to withdraw from a joint mandated iwi organisation, Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Limited must recognise under section 13(1) a mandated iwi organisation for the withdrawing group if the withdrawing group has set up an organisation that meets---
        
    *   (a) the criteria of [section 14][22] (other than section 14(d)(ii)); and
    
    *   (b) the following further criteria:
            
        *   (i) it has on its register of iwi members no fewer than the minimum number of persons specified in column 4 of [Schedule 3][321], in the proportion that the amount attributed to the withdrawing group under [section 20(3)(a)][37] represents of the notional iwi population specified in column 2 of Schedule 3, calculated in accordance with the formula---
            
            a × c 
            
            b 
            
            where---
            
            **a**
            > 
            > is the amount attributed to the withdrawing group under [section 20(3)(a)][37]
            
            **b**
            > 
            > is the total notional population for the iwi set out in column 2 of [Schedule 3][321]
            
            **c**
            > 
            > is the minimum number of members specified in column 4 of [Schedule 3][321]; and
            
            
        
        *   (ii) it has an asset-holding company, as required by [section 12(1)(d)][20].
        
        
    
    (2) Despite subsection (1), if a group has withdrawn from a joint mandated iwi organisation as provided for under [section 20][37], settlement assets must be distributed under [section 36(1)(f)(ii)][59], allocated and transferred under [section 43][66] or [Part 3][185], or payments must be made under [section 84(1)(g)][123] or [section 96(1)(g)][141], as the case may be, to the relevant joint mandated iwi organisation as if no group had withdrawn from that joint mandated iwi organisation.

##### 22 Transfer of assets
    
*   (1) A joint mandated iwi organisation must not transfer to a withdrawing group the assets referred to in [section 20(3)(b)][37] until the withdrawing group has completed the process of withdrawal in accordance with the criteria provided for under section 20(2)(c).
    
    (2) A transfer of assets referred to in subsection (1) must be---
        
    *   (a) free of charge to the withdrawing group, other than reasonable administrative costs; and
    
    *   (b) treated as if it were between wholly-owned asset-holding companies of the joint mandated iwi organisation.
    
    

##### 23 Voting rights
    
*   (1) The mandated iwi organisation of a withdrawing group, after it has completed the process of withdrawal provided for under [section 20(2)(c)][37],---
        
    *   (a) has all the voting rights of a mandated iwi organisation under this Act; and
    
    *   (b) may exercise those rights from the date when it has completed the process of withdrawal.
    
    (2) However, only the joint mandated iwi organisation may exercise voting rights in respect of an appointment or removal at a meeting convened under---
        
    *   (a) [clause 1][349] or [clause 6][355] of Schedule 8 to appoint or remove a member or alternate member of Te Kawai Taumata; or

    *   (a) the notional iwi population represented by the mandated iwi organisation of any withdrawing group is the amount attributed to the withdrawing group under [section 20(3)(a)][37], and
    
    *   (b) the notional iwi population represented by the joint mandated iwi organisation is the number stated in column 2 of [Schedule 3][321], after subtracting the amount attributed, under [section 20(3)(a)][37], to the withdrawing group.
    
    

##### 24 Status of Ngati Hine and Rongomaiwahine
    
*   (1) If Ngati Hine withdraws from the joint mandated iwi organisation of Ngapuhi in accordance with the constitutional documents of Ngapuhi, Ngati Hine becomes, upon completion of its withdrawal, an iwi for the purposes of this Act as if it were listed in Group B---NGAPUHI of [Schedule 3][321].
    
    (2) If Rongomaiwahine withdraws from the joint mandated iwi organisation of Ngati Kahungunu in accordance with the constitutional documents of Ngati Kahungunu, Rongomaiwahine becomes, upon completion of its withdrawal, an iwi for the purposes of this Act as if it were listed in Group G---TAKITIMU of [Schedule 3][321].
    
    (3) Subsections (1) and (2) do not override [section 21(2)][38].

    (2) If the constitutional documents of a mandated iwi organisation make provision as contemplated by subsection (1), that does not disqualify the organisation from being recognised as a mandated iwi organisation or affect the validity of its constitutional documents, to the extent that they relate to matters provided for by or under this Act.

    *   (a) request Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Limited to exercise its powers under [section 133][193]; and

    (2) In offering an opportunity to bid under subsection (1), a mandated iwi organisation that wishes to sell, as a single lot, a bundle of assets that includes 1 or more stocks of settlement quota must provide for---
        
    *   (a) single bids to be made for the total bundle of assets; and
    
    *   (b) a set of bids to be made for lots covering all the assets in the bundle, including separate bids for each individual settlement quota stock.

    (4) A bid submitted under subsection (1) is binding until the conclusion of the sale process required by this subpart.

##### 164 Procedure for selling bundle of assets
    
*   If bids have been received under [section 163(1)][249] to purchase a bundle of assets as a single lot, the mandated iwi organisation offering to sell must---
        
    *   (a) calculate the sum of the highest bids received under [section 163(2)(b)][249] for each of the asset lots; and
    
    *   (b) either---
            
        *   (i) notify all bidders of its intention to proceed with the sale as a bundle of assets or as separate lots, whichever yields the higher total cash return based on the bids received; or
        
        *   (ii) withdraw the settlement quota from sale.
        
        
    
    

##### 165 Procedure to determine right to purchase

    *   (a) in the case of inshore settlement quota, to Te Ohu Kai Moana Group and every mandated iwi organisation that holds a registered coastline entitlement for any inshore stock offered:
    
    *   (b) in the case of freshwater settlement quota, to Te Ohu Kai Moana Group and every mandated iwi organisation whose territory is wholly or partly within a relevant quota management area.
    
    

##### 166 Basis on which sale must proceed
    
*   (1) The vendor must sell to a party that, having been offered the settlement quota under [section 165][251], matches the highest bid obtained under [section 163(1)][249], unless---
        
    *   (a) the vendor decides not to sell; or
    
    *   (b) an alternative procedure has been provided for in rules made under [section 176][268].
    
    (2) If the highest bid is matched by bids from more than 1 party referred to in [section 165][251], the vendor may---
        
    *   (a) negotiate with those parties; or
    
    *   (b) conduct a second bidding process between or amongst those other bidders; or
    
    *   (c) withdraw the settlement quota from sale.
    
    (3) If no party referred to in [section 165][251] matches the highest bid obtained under [section 163(1)][249], the vendor must sell to the party that submitted the highest bid under section 163(1), unless---
        
    *   (a) the vendor decides not to sell; or
    
    *   (b) an alternative procedure has been provided for in rules made under [section 176][268].
    
    (4) If there are 2 matching highest bids obtained under [section 163(1)][249] that are not matched by a party referred to in [section 165][251], the vendor may---
        
    *   (a) negotiate with those parties; or
    
    *   (b) conduct a second bidding process between or amongst those other bidders; or
    
    *   (c) withdraw the settlement quota from sale.
    
    (5) To avoid doubt, subsections (3) and (4) apply to any sale of settlement quota to which [section 165][251] does not apply.

##### 167 Other constraints on disposal
    
*   (1) [Section 162][247] applies if a mandated iwi organisation proposes to enter into a transaction with any party by way of, for example, an option, security, mortgage, or guarantee or series of transactions that could, if the rights under the transaction were exercised, result in---
        
    *   (a) the sale of settlement quota; or
    
    *   (b) the iwi being disentitled, for a period of more than 5 years, to---
            
        *   (i) the income from annual catch entitlements arising from that quota; or
        
        *   (ii) the control or use of the annual catch entitlements arising from that quota.
        
        
    
    (2) [Section 162][247] must be complied with before a transaction referred to in subsection (1) is entered into, but the other provisions of this subpart do not apply at that time.
    
    (3) If a third party to a transaction referred to in subsection (1) exercises a right to sell, or requires a sale of, settlement quota, [sections 161(1)][246] and [163 to 166][249] apply as if the seller were the mandated iwi organisation referred to in subsection (1).
    
    (4) In this section, _third party_ means a party not entitled to hold settlement quota.

##### 168 Application of this subpart to Te Ohu Kai Moana Group
    
*   (1) If an entity within Te Ohu Kai Moana Group acquires settlement quota under this subpart, [sections 161(1)][246] and [163 to 166][249] apply to that entity as if it were a mandated iwi organisation.
    
    (2) An entity within Te Ohu Kai Moana Group must not sell settlement quota unless it---
        
    *   (a) passes a special resolution, in compliance with its constitutional documents, authorising it to exercise, in relation to settlement quota, either---
            
        *   (i) a specific power of sale; or
        
        *   (ii) a general power of sale; and

## Schedule 6  
Methodology for determination of coastline entitlements

[s 11(1), (2)][17]

##### 1 Overview of methodology and status of examples
    
*   (1) The methodology by which the coastline entitlements of iwi must be determined in respect of quota management stocks comprises---
        
    *   (a) the process set out in [clauses 2 to 11][372] which must be followed in making determinations under [section 11][17]; and
    
    *   (b) a geographic information system computation model, described in [clauses 12 to 14][407], that is based on---
            
        *   (i) a specified map database of the coastline of New Zealand; and
        
        *   (ii) specified decision rules; and
        
        *   (iii) matters relevant to creating and maintaining the computation model.
        
        
    
    (2) An example used in this schedule is only illustrative of the provision to which it relates, and does not limit the provision.
    
    (3) If an example and the provision to which it relates are inconsistent, the provision prevails.

## Part 1  
Determination of coastline entitlements

#### Process for making coastline claim

##### 2 Interpretation
    
*   In this Part,---
    
    _affected iwi_ means, in relation to a coastline claim for a particular quota management stock, an iwi whose mandated iwi organisation has made, or is likely to make, coastline claims that abut, overlap, or are contained within, the specified points used in the coastline claims of the claimant iwi for that stock
    
    _coastal boundary point_ means any point on the mean high-water mark whose co-ordinates are defined under the [Fisheries Act 1996][330]
    
    _coastal endpoint_ means a point on the mean high-water mark that is defined in the description of a quota management area under the [Fisheries Act 1996][330]
    
    _harbour entrance point_ means a point on the mean high-water mark on either the northern or southern entrance of the harbour, the co-ordinates of which are listed in [Part 1][380] of Schedule 2
    
    _specified point_ means a point on the coastline that complies with [clause 3(2)(b)][359].

##### 3 Method of making coastline claim
    
*   (1) To enable Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Limited to make a determination of the coastline entitlements of an iwi as required by [section 11][17], the mandated iwi organisation of that iwi must submit to Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Limited---
        
    *   (a) a coastline claim for each quota management stock included in [Schedule 1][319] for which the iwi is entitled to receive an allocation based on coastline under [sections 140 to 142][206]; and
    
    *   (b) coastline claims for each stock for which harbour quota is listed in [Part 2][338] of Schedule 2 and for which the iwi is entitled to receive an allocation under [section 143][212].
    
    (2) A coastline claim for each stock must identify---
        
    *   (a) the quota management stock; and
    
    *   (b) 2 specified points on the coastline, each of which must be---
            
        *   (i) a coastal boundary point; or
        
        *   (ii) a harbour entrance point; or
        
        *   (iii) a point on the mean high-water mark with co-ordinates certified by a registered cadastral surveyor; and
        
        
    
    *   (c) a percentage representing the proportion of the coastline between the 2 specified points that the mandated iwi organisation is claiming for that stock; and
    
    *   (d) all affected iwi for that claim.
    
    (3) A coastline claim submitted under this clause may---
        
    *   (a) contain all, or only some, of the coastline claims necessary to enable Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Limited to determine all the coastline entitlements for the mandated iwi organisation, as required by [section 130(3)(b)][189]:
    
    *   (b) be an interim coastline claim as provided for in [clause 4][394] or a supplementary coastline claim as provided for in [clause 5][408].
    
    ###### Example relating to clause 3
    
    Either of the points may be a point on the mean high-water mark taken from the description of the relevant quota management area boundary for the stock, as set out in [Part 3][409] of Schedule 1 of the Fisheries Act 1996 or otherwise defined under that Act.
    
    If the 2 specified points mark out the 2 extremities of a claimant's territory, the percentage claimed would be 100%.
    
    If a mandated iwi organisation has agreed a percentage split with other mandated iwi organisations, they may set out the points marking out the whole area to which the agreement relates, and the percentage of that area assigned by agreement to the claimant iwi.

##### 4 Interim coastline claims
    
*   (1) If 2 mandated iwi organisations are unable to reach agreement to allow their coastline claims to be made under [clause 3][359], but are able to agree in writing to the geographical extent of the coastline under dispute, each may submit an interim coastline claim based on the undisputed coastline.
    
    (2) An interim coastline claim must comply with the requirements of [clause 3][359], except that it must exclude the area of coastline under dispute.
    
    (3) Following verification under [clause 10][376], an interim coastline claim may be used to determine under [clause 11][363] a coastline entitlement that is then registered as an interim coastline entitlement.
    
    (4) An interim coastline entitlement for a quota management stock satisfies the requirements of [section 130(3)(b)][189] for that stock.
    
    ###### Example relating to clauses 4 and 5
    
    ###### Interim and supplementary claims
    
    Iwi A and iwi B have overlapping claims to a section of coastline. They sign an agreement to exclude the coastline between points X and Y. They may then make interim coastline claims as provided for by [clause 3(3)(b)][359], which may allow them to qualify for allocation of settlement assets. The quota allocated on the basis of the coastline length between points X and Y must be held back by Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Limited until the dispute is resolved.
    
    Following allocation on this basis, where iwi are unable to agree on a boundary point within the section of coastline between points X and Y, they may be able to agree on a percentage split for that section without nominating a boundary point. This is provided for in [clause 3][359].
    
    For example, iwi A and B may agree that, in order to finalise the allocation of settlement quota without conceding to the relevance of a particular point on the coast as a tribal boundary,---
        
    *   40% of the quota to be allocated on the basis of the disputed coastline should go to iwi A; and
    *   60% to iwi B.
    
    Both iwi could then submit a supplementary coastline claim to Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Limited as provided for by [clause 3(3)(b)][359], nominating points X and Y as the specified points and the agreed percentage for their iwi (40% for iwi A and 60% for iwi B).
    
    ![. ](images/MaoriSch6Pt1cl4.jpg)
    
    (5) To avoid doubt, this clause does not apply to a claim for harbour quota.
    
    Schedule 6 Part 1 clause 4(5): added, on 13 December 2006, by [section 8(1)][410] of the Maori Fisheries Amendment Act 2006 (2006 No 78).

##### 5 Supplementary coastline claims
    
*   (1) If, after the registration of an interim coastline entitlement, a dispute referred to in [clause 4(1)][394] is resolved, the affected mandated iwi organisations may make supplementary coastline claims for relevant stocks within the coastline that was the subject of the dispute.
    
    (2) A supplementary coastline claim---
        
    *   (a) must be made---
            
        *   (i) using the method set out in [clause 3][359]; and
        
        *   (ii) solely in respect of the coastline previously in dispute; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) must not be submitted as an interim coastline claim for the coastline previously in dispute.
    
    

##### 6 Endorsements required in support of claim
    
*   (1) Any coastline claim submitted under [clause 3][359] must be accompanied by endorsements from the mandated iwi organisation of each iwi that is an affected iwi in respect of the claim.
    
    (2) Endorsements may be presented in the form of either or both of the following:
        
    *   (a) copies of signed multi-party mandated iwi organisation agreements that include the affected iwi:
    
    *   (b) signed written statements from the mandated iwi organisations of the affected iwi.
    
    (3) Agreements or statements presented under subclause (2) must set out---
        
    *   (a) the stocks for which the iwi is an affected iwi for the purpose of the claims being made; and
    
    *   (b) for each stock, the agreement of the mandated iwi organisation of the affected iwi to the specified point or points in respect of which it is an affected iwi; and
    
    *   (c) for each stock for which the mandated iwi organisation of the affected iwi has made or intends to make a coastline claim between the specified points identified for that stock by the claimant, the agreement of the mandated iwi organisation of the affected iwi to the percentage stated in the coastline claim; and
    
    *   (d) in the case of an agreement supporting an interim coastline claim under [clause 4][394], 2 specified points that define the disputed portion of coastline.
    
    (4) The co-ordinates of all specified points, except harbour entrance points or coastal boundary points, must be supported in a report from a registered cadastral surveyor.
    
    (5) If any part of a claim has been the subject of dispute resolution under [clause 9][411], the documentation of that process may be used to support a claim instead of the endorsements referred to in subclause (1), but the documentation must clearly set out the information required under subclause (3).

##### 7 Agreements
    
*   Before a mandated iwi organisation submits a claim under [clause 3][359] to Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Limited, it must take reasonable steps to reach agreements, in relation to the data required by clause 3(2), with every affected iwi as to the matters set out under [clause 6(3)(a) to (c)][373].

##### 8 Registration of agreements
    
*   (1) A mandated iwi organisation may, at any time, request Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Limited to verify and subsequently place on the iwi register any agreement made by mandated iwi organisations relating to coastline claims to which it is a party.
    
    (2) If a request is made under subclause (1), Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Limited must attempt to verify the agreement by the procedures set out in [clause 10][376].
    
    (3) If Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Limited is able to verify an agreement under subclause (2), it must record the details of the agreement on the iwi register.
    
    (4) The registration of an agreement under this clause binds the parties to the terms of the agreement for any coastline claims to which it is relevant, unless the agreement is withdrawn by written consent of all the parties.

##### 9 Dispute resolution
    
*   (1) If a mandated iwi organisation is unable to reach an agreement required by [clause 7][374], the dispute must be resolved in accordance with [sections 181][276] and [182][277].
    
    (2) Once resolutions are reached under the dispute resolution process,---
        
    *   (a) the points and percentages settled in that process must be included in any relevant coastline claim submitted under [clause 3(1)][359]; and
    
    *   (b) the signed documentation of the resolution of the dispute must be included with the endorsement of the claim required by [clause 6(1)][373].
    
    

#### Process for verifying coastline claims and determining entitlements

##### 10 Verification of coastline claim
    
*   (1) After receiving a coastline claim under [clause 3][359], Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Limited must---
        
    *   (a) attempt to verify that all the data required by [clause 3][359] or [clause 6(3)(d)][373] has been supplied for each stock for which a claim is made; and
    
    *   (b) attempt to verify that each specified point is---
            
        *   (i) a coastal boundary point; or
        
        *   (ii) a harbour entrance point; or
        
        *   (iii) is shown as a co-ordinate that has been provided by, and is supported in a report from, a registered cadastral surveyor; and
        
        
    
    *   (c) satisfy itself that,---
            
        *   (i) for each stock for which a coastline claim is made, there are endorsements as required by [clause 6(1)][373]; and
        
        *   (ii) if a claim for a stock is for less than 100% of the coastline between the specified points, the total of the percentages of the coastline between the specified points assigned to the iwi in the agreement supporting that claim is 100%; and
        
        *   (iii) if any part of a coastline claim has been the subject of a dispute resolution process in accordance with [clause 9][411], there is appropriately authorised documentation of the outcome of the process to support the claim.
        
        
    
    (2) If Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Limited is not able to verify an aspect of a coastline claim, it must refer that matter back to the claimant.
    
    (3) A claimant may clarify the matter referred to it under subclause (2) and resubmit its coastline claim in respect of the affected quota management stocks.

##### 10A Determination of entitlements for harbour quota
    
*   (1) This clause applies when Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Limited, after receiving a coastline claim for harbour quota,---
        
    *   (a) has verified the matters set out in [clause 10(1)(a) and (b)][376]; and
    
    *   (b) is satisfied as to the matters set out in [clause 10(1)(c)][376].
    
    (2) Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Limited must determine coastline entitlements for harbour quota by multiplying the percentage set out in the claim (as required by [clause 3(2)(c)][359]) by the total number of harbour quota shares for the relevant stock and harbour.
    
    (3) For each harbour quota stock, the percentage set out in the claim and the number of shares resulting from the calculation made under subclause (2) together describe the coastline entitlement for the claimant iwi.
    
    Schedule 6 Part 1 clause 10A: inserted, on 13 December 2006, by [section 8(2)][410] of the Maori Fisheries Amendment Act 2006 (2006 No 78).

##### 11 Determination of entitlements other than for harbour quota
    
*   (1) Before the determination of a coastline entitlement under this clause, Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Limited must determine the length of the relevant quota management area by applying the 2 coastal endpoints for the area as input to the computation model described in [Part 2][412] of this schedule.
    
    (2) When Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Limited has verified the matters set out in [clause 10(1)(a) and (b)][376] and is satisfied of the matters set out in [clause 10(1)(c)][376], it must determine coastline entitlements as follows:
        
    *   (a) for each coastline claim, the data representing the 2 specified points must be applied as input to the computation model to produce output that represents the coastline length between the 2 points; and
    
    *   (b) using the coastline length of the relevant quota management area determined under subclause (1), the percentage of the quota management area coastline represented by the result obtained from the calculation under paragraph (a) must be determined; and
    
    *   (c) the result obtained from the determination under paragraph (b) must be multiplied by the percentage set out in the claim, as required by [clause 3(2)(c)][359]; and
    
    *   (d) the result obtained from the calculation under paragraph (c) must be multiplied by the total number of settlement quota shares to be allocated on the basis of coastline for the stock that is the subject of the claim.
    
    (3) For each stock, the results obtained from calculations made under subclause (2)(c) and (d) together describe the coastline entitlement for the claimant iwi.
    
    ###### Examples for clause 11
        
    *   If the stock is an inshore stock, the entitlement is a percentage of the total settlement quota for that stock, and the equivalent number of quota shares.
    *   If the stock is a deepwater stock, the entitlement is a percentage of the part of the settlement quota that is allocated on the basis of coastline (ie, 25% of the total settlement quota for the stock, and the equivalent number of quota shares).
    
    Schedule 6 Part 1 clause 11 heading: amended, on 13 December 2006, by [section 8(3)][410] of the Maori Fisheries Amendment Act 2006 (2006 No 78).

##### 11A Recalculation of entitlements
    
*   (1) Subsection (2) applies if---
        
    *   (a) the number of shares for a stock available for distribution is reduced by the application of [section 23(1)][384] of the Fisheries Act 1996 as a result of accrued rights arising under [section 28N][385] of the Fisheries Act 1983; and
    
    *   (b) an iwi entitlement to a stock has been calculated and registered under [clause 10A][362] or [11][363]; but
    
    *   (c) the quota shares have not been transferred to the iwi.
    
    (2) Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Limited must recalculate the number of shares of the entitlement and amend the register.
    
    Schedule 6 Part 1 clause 11A: inserted, on 13 December 2006, by [section 8(4)][410] of the Maori Fisheries Amendment Act 2006 (2006 No 78).

## Part 2  
Computation model

##### 12 Requirement for computation model
    
*   (1) Before making the first calculation of coastline lengths to be used to determine coastline entitlements for the purposes of [section 11][17], Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Limited must ensure that an appropriate computation model is created for the purpose of calculating coastline lengths between 2 specified coordinates on the mean high-water mark.
    
    (2) Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Limited must ensure that, after the first application under [clause 11][363] of the computation model to produce results to be used to determine a coastline entitlement, there are no alterations to---
        
    *   (a) the software, algorithms, or computer code of the model; or
    
    *   (b) the specified baselines; or
    
    *   (c) the specified decision rules; or
    
    *   (d) the hardware platform for the model.
    
    (3) Subclause (2) does not exclude alterations to the model unless the alteration would mean that a recalculation of a coastline length, using the input data used for a completed determination under [clause 11][363], would produce an output differing from the original result by more than 1%.
    
    (4) Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Limited must ensure that the records of all input data applied to, and output data derived from, the computation model for determining coastline entitlements are preserved for not less than 10 years.

##### 13 Specified baselines
    
*   (1) The computation model used for determining coastline entitlements must use the following baselines:
        
    *   (a) the map database created for the purpose by Land Information New Zealand from the 1:50 000 topographical map series; and
    
    *   (b) the coastal endpoints of each quota management area; and
    
    *   (c) the harbour entrance points.
    
    (2) Coastlines must be defined along the line of the mean high-water mark.
    
    (3) For each quota management area, Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Limited must specify a date upon which the coastal endpoints referred to in subclause (1) are definitive, and any later change to the quota management area under the [Fisheries Act 1996][330] has no effect for the purpose of determining coastline entitlements under this Act.

##### 14 Decision rules for computation model
    
*   The calculation of coastline lengths must be based on the following decision rules in relation to the specified geographical features:
        
    *   ###### River mouth
    
    *   (a) Rivers are cut off where the mean high-water mark meets the natural entrance points of the river, and the distance across the river mouth is included in the coastline length.
    
    *   ###### Bays
    
    *   (b) A bay is an indentation of the coast,---
            
        *   (i) the area of which is not less than the area of a semicircle with a diameter drawn across the mouth of the indentation; and
        
        *   (ii) the length of the diameter referred to in subparagraph (i) is 10 km or less.
        
        
    
    *   (c) The straight line drawn across the mouth of a bay is substituted for the actual coastline of the bay in the calculation of coastline length.
    
    *   (d) The presence of islands at the mouth of, or within, an indentation does not affect the calculations necessary to determine whether an indentation is a bay.
    
    *   ###### Offshore islands
    
    *   (e) An offshore island is a naturally formed area of land that, at mean high-water tides, is---
            
        *   (i) surrounded by water; but
        
        *   (ii) not submerged by water.
        
        
    
    *   (f) The coastlines of the following offshore islands must be counted as coastlines of the relevant quota management areas:
            
        *   (i) Stewart/Rakiura:
        
        *   (ii) Great Barrier/Aotea:
        
        *   (iii) Motiti.
        
        
    
    *   (g) The coastlines of other offshore islands must be counted as coastlines of the relevant quota management area if Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Limited is satisfied that 1 or more iwi have---
            
        *   (i) ahi kaaroa (both long-term and current habitation on the island); and
        
        *   (ii) a traditional and separate fishery associated with the island; and
        
        *   (iii) current occupation of the island, as shown by the presence of marae and other communal structures.
        
        
    
    *   ###### Chatham Islands
    
    *   (h) For the purpose of calculating the coastline in the Chatham zone, only the coastlines of the following islands are relevant:
            
        *   (i) Chatham Island; and
        
        *   (ii) Pitt Island.

*   This is a reprint of the Maori Fisheries Act 2004\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 16 September 2011, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][425] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][426] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][427] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][428] and [17E][429] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)

    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
