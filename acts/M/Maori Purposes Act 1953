##### 3 Beneficial owners of trust estates incorporated
    
*   (1) The equitable and beneficial owners of the land comprised in each trust estate, other than the Maraetaha No 2, Section 4, Trust Estate (the assets of which are comprised exclusively of property other than land), are hereby constituted a body corporate under Part 17 of the Maori Land Act 1931 from 1 July 1953, as if an order of incorporation had been made by the court in that behalf, and, except as otherwise provided in this Part, all the provisions of the said Part 17 and the regulations made thereunder shall apply to every such body corporate accordingly.
    
    (2) Every body corporate constituted by this section shall bear the name "The Proprietors of \[_name of the land as set out in Part 3 of Schedule 1 of the Maori Purposes Act 1951_\]":
    
    provided that the body corporate of the beneficial owners of the land comprised in the Mangaotane Trust Estate shall bear the name "The Proprietors of Mangatu Nos 5 and 6".
    
    (3) On application by the Commissioner, the court, at any time after the commencement of this Act, shall, in accordance with rules of court, fix a time and place for the holding of a general meeting of the members of any body corporate constituted by this section, for the purpose of electing a committee of management therefor.
    
    (4) Notwithstanding the provisions of Part 17 of the Maori Land Act 1931, the fee simple of the land comprised in any trust estate shall not, by reason of the constitution of the beneficial owners thereof as a body corporate by this section, vest in the body corporate, but every such body corporate shall be entitled to have transferred to it all land and all personal property comprised in the trust estate in accordance with and subject to the provisions of this Part.
    
    (5) Notwithstanding the constitution by this section of the bodies corporate aforesaid, the Commissioner shall continue to hold so much of the trust estates as have not been transferred by him under this Part and to conduct the business thereof in accordance with the powers and authorities vested in him as trustee and agent for the bodies corporate hereby constituted until such time in each case as he has, in accordance with the provisions of [section 4][6], transferred and delivered to the body corporate the assets for the time being held by him in respect thereof, and the committee of management appointed for the body corporate shall have no power to deal with any such assets so held by the Commissioner until they are so transferred and delivered.

##### 4 Commissioner to transfer trust estates to bodies corporate
    
*   (1) Subject to the provisions of this section, the Commissioner is hereby authorized and directed, as soon as conveniently may be after the commencement of this Act, to transfer and assure to each of the bodies corporate constituted by [section 3][5] the title to all land and interests in land comprised in the trust estate in respect of which the body corporate is constituted, and to transfer, set over, and deliver all livestock, plant, implements, stores, and farming chattels comprised in and allocated exclusively to the trust estate, freed and discharged from any liability to the Commissioner except the general liability to contribution and the liability to indemnify the Commissioner imposed by this Part.
    
    (2) Before any transfer in accordance with subsection (1) is made of any property comprised in any trust estate for the time being indebted to the Commissioner, the body corporate constituted in respect of that trust estate shall make arrangements with the Commissioner for the payment of the following amounts:
        
    *   (a) the amount owing by the trust estate to the Commissioner as at 30 June 1953, as recorded in the books of account of the Commissioner:
    
    *   (b) such further amount as may be owing by the trust estate to the Commissioner in respect of advances made in the course of the conduct of the business of the trust estate on and after 1 July 1953:
    
    *   (c) any sum ascertained in accordance with subsection (4) as chargeable to the trust estate in respect of the charges, expenses, and liabilities incurred or to be incurred by the Commissioner in carrying out the duties prescribed for him under this Part.
    
    (3) Upon the payment, or, as the case may be, upon the making of arrangements satisfactory to the Commissioner for the payment, of the amounts referred to in subsection (2), the Commissioner shall contemporaneously transfer and assure to the body corporate the farming assets of the trust estate in respect of which the body corporate is constituted.
    
    (4) The sum referred to in paragraph (c) of subsection (2) shall be the sum ascertained by the Commissioner, with the approval and concurrence of his duly appointed auditors, as the proportion fairly and justly chargeable to the trust estate in respect of which it is ascertained, of the total existing liabilities and losses of the Commission not chargeable directly to any 1 or more of the trust estates, and of the total estimated contingent liabilities, costs, and expenses arising out of the winding up of the Commissioner's business and assets generally.
    
    (5) On the transfer to any body corporate of the land and chattels of the trust estate, in accordance with subsection (1) or subsection (3), all book debts (whether for advances to beneficiaries or otherwise) and all choses in action the property of the trust estate shall vest in the body corporate, and the Commissioner, at the request of the body corporate made at the time of transfer or at any time thereafter, shall formally assign and transfer any such book debt or chose in action accordingly.
    
    (6) On the transfer as aforesaid to a body corporate of the land and chattels comprised in any trust estate, the Commissioner shall pay over to the body corporate all moneys appropriated and held by him to the credit of individual beneficial owners in the trust estate, and all such moneys shall be held by the body corporate upon the same trusts and subject to the same liabilities and encumbrances as they were subject to in the hands of the Commissioner.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Maori Purposes Act 1953\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 27 November 1970, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][45] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][46] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][47] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][48] and [17E][49] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
