    (4) It shall be in the power of the said trustees, under the name of the Raukawa Marae Trustees, to acquire by purchase, lease, or gift any land adjoining or adjacent to the said lands for the purpose of enlarging or improving the said Raukawa Marae, and to be held upon the same trusts.

    *   (b) If a trustee dies, or is removed under the last preceding paragraph, the Court may, on the application of the said trustees, appoint a new trustee or new trustees to fill the vacancy, or may appoint additional trustees:
        
        Provided that trustees appointed to fill vacancies shall as far as practical be chosen from the relative hapu or section from which his predecessor was selected.

##### 11 Setting aside land for Sir James Carroll Memorial
    
*   Whereas it is proposed to erect a memorial to the late Sir James Carroll which is intended to include the construction of a Maori meeting house and other appurtenances and accessories: And whereas the Maori owners of the following lands situated in the Tairawhiti Maori Land Court District---namely Taumata-o-teo Number 22E, Taumata-o-teo Number 24A, Taumata-o-teo Number 25B, Taumata-o-teo Number 34, Taumata-o-teo Number 35, (all which lands are hereinafter in this section referred to as the said land, and shall be known as the Waihirere Marae)---desire to set aside such lands as a site or sites for the purpose aforesaid and as a Maori reservation for the purposes of this section: Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    (1) The Court is hereby authorised and empowered to make an order vesting the said land in 2 or more trustees in trust to hold and administer the same for the purpose of this section. On the making of a vesting order or orders under this section the land affected thereby shall be deemed to be one Maori reservation within the meaning of section 298 of the principal Act, set apart and reserved for the common use of the Wairoa section of the Ngati-Kahungunu Maori Tribe, including the beneficial owners of the said land, as a meeting place, a building site, a recreation ground, or in any other manner.
    
    (2) It shall be in the power of such trustees to acquire by purchase, lease, or gift, and without confirmation under Part 13 of the principal Act, any other land which it may be thought expedient to acquire for use in conjunction with the said land, and the land when so acquired shall be deemed to be and become part of the Maori reservation created by this section, and be deemed freehold land within the meaning of the principal Act.
    
    (3) The Court may from time to time make such rules as it thinks expedient for the administration and control of the Maori reservation hereby created, and for the proper use thereof, or any part thereof, by any person. Any regulation in force under section 298 of the principal Act shall not (except where such regulations are expressly made so to do) apply to the Maori reservation created under this section.
    
    (4) Notwithstanding anything in the Land Transfer Act 1915, the District Land Registrar may, without payment of fee, issue a certificate of title for the said land to the trustees appointed under this section.
    
    (5) 
        
    *   (a) For the purpose of erecting a memorial as aforesaid and accessories and appurtenances thereto on the said land for the improvement of the Maori reservation, and for the management of any gathering or ceremony taking place in connection with the memorial, including the acquisition of furniture and other chattels, there is hereby constituted a committee, to be called the Carroll Memorial Committee, consisting of the President of the Tairawhiti Maori Land Board, the East Coast Commissioner, and Te Hata Tipoki of Wairoa (or if he shall die or be incapable of acting, such other Maori of the Wairoa District as the Minister of Maori Affairs may appoint), and the said committee is hereby empowered to make all arrangements and to do all things necessary for the construction of buildings and for any other purpose specified in this paragraph of this subsection. The said committee shall appoint one of its members as chairman and shall otherwise regulate its own proceedings. The committee shall continue in office until the said memorial and accessories and appurtenances thereto are completed and handed over to the trustees appointed under this section, and until the ceremony taking place in connection with the memorial is concluded.
    
    *   (b) For the purpose of making payments in connection with the construction of the memorial and the accessories and appurtenances thereto, and in connection with any ceremony taking place in regard thereto, and for any other purpose which the Carroll Memorial Committee may think expedient, the Tairawhiti District Maori Land Board shall, whenever required so to do by the committee, make payments from money in the Carroll Memorial Fund referred to in the next succeeding subsection. Any payment made by the said Board out of the Carroll Memorial Fund shall be deemed to be a proper payment if made upon the certificate of the committee. Such certificate may be given before or after the payment it refers to.
    
    (6) 
        
    *   (a) For the purpose of this section a fund is hereby established to be called the Carroll Memorial Fund (herein called the said fund), to be kept by the Tairawhiti Maori Land Board, and the Board may, subject to the provisions of the last preceding subsection, from time to time expend the money in such fund for the acquisition of land, the improvement of the Maori reservation, the erection, replacement, repair, upkeep, and insurance of buildings, the preparing and paying the upkeep of sports grounds, the expenses of any gathering or ceremony taking place in connection with the memorial, the acquisition of furniture and other chattels, and generally for any purpose in connection with or incidental to the said land as the Board may think proper. The expenditure of money upon the said land or any part thereof in respect of improvements, buildings, or chattels prior to the commencement of this Act shall be deemed to be expenditure duly authorised.
    
    *   (b) Any Maori Land Board or East Coast Commissioner, or any local authority, corporate body, company, trustee, or person may contribute to the said fund for the purpose of furthering the objects thereof, and any payment or contributions so made shall be deemed to be a payment lawfully made, anything in any Act to the contrary notwithstanding.
    
    *   (c) The assembled owners of any parcel of Maori land, or the committee of any land vested in the East Coast Commissioner, may pass a resolution that such sum as may be indicated shall be paid to the said fund out of any rents or other money which is due or accruing due or payable in the future either in one sum or by instalments. Any resolution heretofore passed for the purpose set forth in this section shall enure for the purposes of this Act as if it had originated under this section, and shall be deemed to have so originated.
    
    *   (d) It shall be lawful for a Maori Land Board, the Maori Trustee, or the East Coast Commissioner to make advances out of their respective accounts of the whole or any part of the amounts directed by any resolution passed under the last preceding paragraph in anticipation of the rents or other money to become due or payable, and to charge the money so advanced against the land affected. In the case of a Maori Land Board a memorandum of charge may be executed under section 109 of the principal Act.
    
    (7) When the Carroll Memorial Committee has fulfilled the purposes for which it was constituted the provisions of subsection [(5)][11] of this section shall cease to operate, and thereafter all payments out of the said fund shall be made as the regulations prescribe, or, if there are no regulations, on the certificate of 2 or more of the trustees as the Court may authorise. The Tairawhiti Maori Land Board shall not be bound to pay any amount so certified by the trustees, but if any dispute shall arise between the Board and the trustees the matter shall be referred to the Minister of Maori Affairs, whose decision shall be final and shall be acted upon accordingly.
    
    In the preamble to this section the words ""Hinewhaki West (or Number 2) Section 29, Hinewhaki West (or Number 2), section 30, and Hinewhaki West (or Number 2) section 31"" were omitted by section [11(9)][23] Maori Purposes Act 1937\.
