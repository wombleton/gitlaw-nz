    (2) A notice referred to in subclause (1) must be in writing and must include all of the following:

#### Hearings

##### 8 Manner in which Disputes Tribunal conducts hearings
    
*   (1) Every hearing of a Disputes Tribunal must be conducted in private and with as little formality as the requirements of this Act and the proper consideration of the matters before the Disputes Tribunal permit.
    
    (2) The Disputes Tribunal may accept any relevant evidence or information, whether or not that evidence or information would normally be admissible in a court of law.

##### 9 Right to appear at hearings
    
*   (1) At any hearing of an application or claim before a Disputes Tribunal, any party to the proceedings is entitled to attend and be heard.
    
    (2) No party is entitled to be represented at a hearing of the Disputes Tribunal by a representative unless the adjudicator---
        
    *   (a) considers it appropriate in all the circumstances to allow a party to be represented; and
    
    *   (b) approves the representative.
    
    (3) However, the following parties may be represented by a representative who is approved by the adjudicator:
        
    *   (a) a corporation or an unincorporated body of persons, if the representative is an officer or employee or a member of the corporation or body or holds a majority interest in it:
    
    *   (b) a person jointly liable or entitled with another or others, if the representative is one of the persons jointly liable or entitled or, in the case of a partnership, is an employee of those persons:
    
    *   (c) a minor, or other person under disability:
    
    *   (d) any other person, if the adjudicator is satisfied that for sufficient cause that person is unable to appear in person or is unable to present the person's case adequately.
    
    (4) If any party to any proceedings before the Disputes Tribunal is represented by a representative, any other party to those proceedings may also be represented.
    
    (5) An adjudicator must not approve a representative---

    *   (b) who, in the opinion of the adjudicator, has been regularly engaged in advocacy work before other tribunals.
    
    (6) Subclause (5) does not apply if---

    *   (b) the party seeking to be represented is a company and the person proposed for approval is the majority shareholder of the company.
    
    

##### 10 Duties of assessor
    
*   (1) The duties of an assessor are to---
        
    *   (a) sit with the Disputes Tribunal; and
    
    *   (b) act in all respects as an extra member of the Disputes Tribunal for the hearing of the application; and
    
    *   (c) act as an extra member of the Disputes Tribunal to assist in the determination of the application, but the adjudicator alone determines the application.
    
    (2) Before starting his or her duties, an assessor must take an oath before the adjudicator that the assessor will faithfully and impartially perform the duties.
    
    (3) The failure of an assessor to perform his or her duties does not prevent the adjudicator from making a decision on the application without the input of the assessor.
    
    (4) An adjudicator who is satisfied that it is appropriate to do so may appoint a substitute assessor under [section 82(3)(b)][122].

##### 11 Remuneration and allowances of assessors

##### 12 Immunity of witnesses, adjudicators, and assessors
    
*   (1) Witnesses have the same privileges and immunities in relation to the hearings of a Disputes Tribunal as they would have if the hearings were proceedings in a court of law.
    
    (2) Neither an adjudicator nor an assessor is under any criminal or civil liability in respect of---
        
    *   (a) any act done or omitted in the course of the exercise or intended exercise of any of their functions, duties, or powers under this Act; or
    
    *   (b) any words spoken or written at, or for the purposes of, any hearing under this Act.
    
    (3) Subclause (2) does not apply if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court before which any proceedings are taken that the adjudicator or the assessor, as the case may be, has acted in bad faith.

#### Decisions

*   (1) The adjudicator's decision is the decision of the Disputes Tribunal.

    *   (b) contain the reasons for the decision.
    
    

##### 14 Disputes Tribunal may award costs in certain circumstances

    *   (a) in the opinion of the Disputes Tribunal,---
            
        *   (i) the proceedings are frivolous or vexatious or ought not to have been brought:
        
        *   (ii) the matter ought reasonably to have been settled before proceeding to a hearing but that the party against whom an award of costs is to be made refused, without reasonable excuse, to take part in the discussions referred to in [clause 5(1)(b)][346] or acted in a contemptuous or improper manner during those discussions; or
        
        
    
    *   (b) any party, after receiving notice of a hearing, fails to attend the hearing without good cause.

        *   (i) the reasonable costs of the Disputes Tribunal hearing:
        
        *   (ii) the fees and expenses of any witness that have been paid or are payable by the Crown; or
        
        
    
    *   (b) to another party all, or any part of, the reasonable costs of that other party in connection with the proceedings.

    (2) Upon filing, the decision is enforceable in all respects as a final judgment of the District Court in its civil jurisdiction.
    
    (3) No decision of a Disputes Tribunal may be filed unless the time allowed for an appeal against the decision has expired and no appeal has been brought.
    
    (4) For the purposes of this clause, _District Court_, in relation to the filing under subclause (1) of a decision of a Disputes Tribunal, means the District Court nearest to the place of business at which the motor vehicle in respect of which the decision is given was sold.
    
    Schedule 1 clause 15(1): amended, on 1 October 2010, by [section 24(7)][364] of the Motor Vehicle Sales Amendment Act 2010 (2010 No 112).

    (2) If the amount of the claim exceeds $12,500, the appeal may be brought on either of the following grounds:
