    *   (a) the iwi aquaculture organisation is a mandated iwi organisation under the [Maori Fisheries Act 2004][79]; and
    
    *   (b) the trustee is satisfied that the constitution of the organisation authorises the organisation to act on behalf of its iwi in relation to aquaculture claims and settlement assets under this Act; and
    
    *   (c) in the case of a joint mandated iwi organisation (as defined in [section 5][81] of the Maori Fisheries Act 2004), the trustee is satisfied that the constitution of the organisation includes a process for determining the division of settlement assets between the organisation and a withdrawing group (as defined in [section 19][122] of that Act).
    
    (2) The trustee must recognise a new iwi aquaculture organisation and record its recognition in the iwi aquaculture register in place of another iwi aquaculture organisation (an **existing iwi aquaculture organisation**) if---
        
    *   (a) the new iwi aquaculture organisation is entitled to be recognised under subsection (1); and
    
    *   (b) before becoming a mandated iwi organisation under the [Māori Fisheries Act 2004][79], the existing iwi aquaculture organisation notified the members of the iwi of the proposed replacement and of the effect of that replacement in terms of subsections (3) and (4).
    
    (3) On and from the time when the new iwi aquaculture organisation is recognised in place of the existing iwi aquaculture organisation under subsection (2), all rights and interests of the existing iwi aquaculture organisation under this Act become the rights and interests of the new iwi aquaculture organisation.
    
    (4) Without limiting subsection (3),---
        
    *   (a) any regional agreement entered into under [section 10][13] by the existing iwi aquaculture organisation is to be treated as having been entered into by the new iwi aquaculture organisation; and
    
    *   (b) any entitlement, claim, agreement, or written statement in respect of the allocation of settlement assets made or entered into by the existing iwi aquaculture organisation is to be treated as having been made or entered into by the new iwi aquaculture organisation; and
    
    *   (c) any settlement assets held by the existing iwi aquaculture organisation become the settlement assets of the new iwi aquaculture organisation; and
    
    *   (d) any settlement assets held by an enterprise under [section 32(3)][39] for the existing iwi aquaculture organisation are to be held for the new iwi aquaculture organisation.
    
    (5) To avoid doubt, [section 50][59] does not apply to settlement assets that become the settlement assets of the new iwi aquaculture organisation by subsections (3) and (4).

    (4) The trustee may amend a determination to give effect to a written agreement referred to in [section 45(4)][54] to the extent that the agreement relates to settlement assets under a regional agreement that was entered into after the written agreement and, if it does so, the amendment becomes a determination of settlement assets allocation entitlements.

    *   (a) only to iwi whose territory abuts the coastline of the region in which the assets are situated; and
    
    *   (b) in accordance with settlement assets allocation entitlements determined and registered under [section 31][37].
    
    (3) The trustee must not determine settlement assets allocation entitlements in relation to a region until all iwi entitled to make a claim for assets in the region have had iwi aquaculture organisations recognised by the trustee.

##### 46 Criteria for agreement
    
*   In reaching an agreement for the purposes of [sections 48][57] and [49][58], the iwi aquaculture organisations must have regard to---
        
    *   (a) whether all iwi will be treated equitably based on the value and quality of the settlement assets to be transferred to them; and
    
    *   (b) the desirability of allocating settlement assets that are of an economic size.
    
    

##### 47 Basis of allocation of settlement assets
    
*   (1) The trustee must determine settlement assets allocation entitlements in accordance with this section and Schedule 1 if,---
        
    *   (a) by the end of the 12-month period specified in [section 45(4A)][54], the iwi aquaculture organisations have not made a written agreement; and
    
    *   (b) at any time after the end of the 12-month period specified in [section 45(4A)][54], an iwi aquaculture organisation notifies the trustee in writing that it does not intend to enter into a written agreement.

    *   (b) to agree on the proportion of the harbour settlement assets for the harbour that must be attributed to each iwi and used subsequently by the iwi aquaculture organisation of each iwi in submitting claims for settlement assets allocation entitlements for that harbour.
    
    (5) If, after negotiating in good faith, the iwi aquaculture organisations cannot reach agreement under subsection (4), they may enter into the dispute resolution process provided for in [sections 52 to 55][62].

## Part 1  
Determination of allocation entitlements

#### Process for making allocation entitlement claim

##### 3 Method of making claim for allocation entitlement
    
*   (1) To enable the trustee to make a determination of the settlement assets allocation entitlements of an iwi as required by [section 45][54], the iwi aquaculture organisation of the iwi must submit to the trustee---
        
    *   (a) a coastal claim for each regional coastline the rohe of the iwi abuts, that is not within any of the harbours listed in [Schedule 2][73]; and
    
    *   (b) a harbour claim for each harbour listed in [Schedule 2][73] within which the rohe of the iwi abuts high-water mark.
    
    (2) Each claim must identify---
        
    *   (a) the regional coastline or harbour to which the claim pertains; and
    
    *   (b) 2 specified points on the coastline, each of which must be---
            
        *   (i) a coastal boundary point; or
        
        *   (ii) a coastal endpoint; or
        
        *   (iii) a harbour entrance point; or
        
        *   (iv) a point on the mean high-water mark with co-ordinates certified by a registered cadastral surveyor; and
        
        
    
    *   (c) a percentage representing the proportion of the coastline between the 2 specified points that the iwi aquaculture organisation is claiming for that regional coastline or harbour; and
    
    *   (d) all affected iwi for that claim.
    
    (3) In the case of a harbour claim, for the purposes of subclause (2)(b), the points must be the entrance points of the harbour.
    
    (4) A group of claims submitted by an iwi aquaculture organisation under this clause may cover all, or only some, of the claims that the iwi is entitled to make.

##### 4 Endorsements required in support of claim
    
*   (1) Any claim submitted under [clause 3][103] must be accompanied by endorsements from the iwi aquaculture organisation of each iwi that is an affected iwi in respect of the claim.
    
    (2) Endorsements may be presented in the form of either or both of the following:
        
    *   (a) copies of signed multi-party iwi aquaculture organisation agreements that include the affected iwi:
    
    *   (b) signed written statements from the iwi aquaculture organisations of the affected iwi.
    
    (3) Agreements or statements presented under subclause (2) must set out---
        
    *   (a) the regional coastlines and harbours for which the iwi is an affected iwi for the purpose of the claims being made; and
    
    *   (b) for each regional coastline and harbour the agreement of the iwi aquaculture organisation of the affected iwi to the specified point or points in respect of which it is an affected iwi; and
    
    *   (c) for each regional coastline and harbour for which the iwi aquaculture organisation of the affected iwi has made, or intends to make, a claim for a settlement assets allocation entitlement between the specified points identified by the claimant, the agreement of the iwi aquaculture organisation of the affected iwi to the percentage submitted by the claimant iwi.
    
    (4) The co-ordinates of all specified points, except harbour entrance points, coastal endpoints, or coastal boundary points, must be supported in a report from a registered cadastral surveyor.
    
    (5) If any part of a claim has been the subject of dispute resolution under [clause 7][139], the documentation of that process may be used to support a claim instead of the endorsements referred to in subclause (1), but the documentation must clearly set out the information required under subclause (3).

##### 5 Agreements
    
*   Before an iwi aquaculture organisation submits a claim under [clause 3][103] to the trustee, it must take reasonable steps to reach agreements, in relation to the data required by clause 3(2), with every affected iwi as to the matters set out under [clause 4(3)][140].

##### 6 Registration of agreements
    
*   (1) An iwi aquaculture organisation may, at any time, request the trustee to verify and subsequently place on the iwi aquaculture register any agreement made by iwi aquaculture organisations relating to aquaculture claims to which it is a party.
    
    (2) If a request is made under subclause (1), the trustee must attempt to verify the agreement by the application of the procedures set out in [clause 8][141].
    
    (3) If the trustee is able to verify an agreement under subclause (2), it must record the details of the agreement on the iwi aquaculture register.
    
    (4) The registration of an agreement under this clause binds the parties to the terms of the agreement for any coastline claims to which it is relevant, unless the agreement is withdrawn by written consent of all the parties.

##### 7 Dispute resolution
    
*   (1) If an iwi aquaculture organisation is unable to reach an agreement required by [clause 5][142], the dispute must be resolved in accordance with [sections 52 to 55][62].
    
    (2) Once resolutions are reached under the dispute resolution process,---
        
    *   (a) the points and percentages settled in that process must be included in any relevant claim submitted under [clause 3(1)][103]; and
    
    *   (b) the signed documentation of the resolution of the dispute must be included with the endorsements of the claim required by [clause 4(1)][140].
    
    

#### Process for verifying claims and determining entitlements

##### 8 Verification of claim for entitlement
    
*   (1) After receiving a claim under [clause 3][103], the trustee must---
        
    *   (a) attempt to verify that all the data required by [clause 3][103] has been supplied for each regional coastline or harbour for which a claim is made; and
    
    *   (b) attempt to verify that each specified point is---
            
        *   (i) a coastal boundary point; or
        
        *   (ii) a coastal endpoint; or
        
        *   (iii) a harbour entrance point; or
        
        *   (iv) shown as a co-ordinate that has been provided by, and is supported in a report from, a registered cadastral surveyor; and
        
        
    
    *   (c) satisfy itself that,---
            
        *   (i) for each claim, there are endorsements as required by [clause 4(1)][140]; and
        
        *   (ii) if a claim is for less than 100% of the coastline between specified points, the total of the percentages assigned to the iwi in the agreement supporting that claim is 100%; and
        
        *   (iii) if any part of a claim has been the subject of a dispute resolution process in accordance with [clause 7][139], there is appropriately authorised documentation of the outcome of the process to support the claim.
        
        
    
    (2) If the trustee is not able to verify an aspect of a claim, it must refer that matter back to the claimant.
    
    (3) A claimant may clarify the matter referred to it under subclause (2) and resubmit its coastline claim.

##### 9 Determination of coastal entitlements
    
*   (1) Before the determination of a coastal settlement assets allocation entitlement under this clause, the trustee must determine the length of the relevant regional coastline by applying the relevant 2 coastal endpoints, as notified in the _Gazette_, as input to the computation model described in [Part 2][143] of this schedule.
    
    (2) When the trustee has verified the matters set out in [clause 8(1)(a) and (b)][141] and is satisfied of the matters set out in clause 8(1)(c), it must determine coastal settlement assets allocation entitlements as follows:
        
    *   (a) for each claim, the data representing the 2 specified points must be applied as input to the computation model to produce output that represents the coastline length between the 2 points; and
    
    *   (b) using the length of the relevant regional coastline determined under subclause (1), the percentage of the regional coastline represented by the result obtained from the calculation under paragraph (a) must be determined; and
    
    *   (c) the result obtained from the determination under paragraph (b) must be multiplied by the percentage set out in the claim, as required by [clause 3(2)(c)][103].
    
    (3) For each claim, the results obtained from calculations made under subclause (2)(c) describe the settlement asset allocation entitlement for the claimant iwi for the regional coastline that is the subject of the claim.

##### 10 Determination of harbour entitlements
    
*   If, in relation to a harbour claim, the trustee has verified the matters set out in [clause 8(1)(a) and (b)][141] and is satisfied about the matters set out in clause 8(1)(c), the trustee must determine the harbour settlement assets allocation entitlement of the claimant to be the percentage set out in the claim as required by [clause 3(2)(c)][103].

## Part 2  
Computation model

##### 11 Requirement for computation model
    
*   (1) Before making the first calculation of coastline lengths to be used to determine allocation entitlements for the purposes of [section 45][54], the trustee must ensure that an appropriate computation model is created for the purpose of calculating coastline lengths between 2 specified co-ordinates on the mean high-water mark.
    
    (2) The trustee must ensure that, after the first application under [clause 9][144] of the computation model to produce results to be used to determine a coastline entitlement, there are no alterations to---
        
    *   (a) the software, algorithms, or computer code of the model; or
    
    *   (b) the specified baselines; or
    
    *   (c) the specified decision rules; or
    
    *   (d) the hardware platform for the model.
    
    (3) Subclause (2) does not exclude alterations to the model unless the alteration would mean that a recalculation of a coastline length, using the input data used for a completed determination under [clause 9][144], would produce an output differing from the original result by more than 1%.
    
    (4) The trustee must ensure that the records of all input data applied to, and output data derived from, the computation model for determining coastline entitlements are preserved for not less than 10 years.

##### 12 Specified baselines
    
*   (1) The computation model used for determining allocation entitlements must use the following baselines:
        
    *   (a) the map database created for the purpose by Land Information New Zealand from the 1:50 000 topographical map series; and
    
    *   (b) the coastal endpoints as notified in the _Gazette_ for each regional coastline; and
    
    *   (c) the harbour entrance points listed in [Schedule 2][73].
    
    (2) Coastlines must be defined along the line of the mean high-water mark.
    
    (3) If the regional planning area of a regional council is altered and, as a result, the coastal endpoints referred to in subclause (1)(b) no longer represent the points where the boundary of the regional planning area intersects the coastline, then the trustee must---
        
    *   (a) redefine the coastal endpoints accordingly; and
    
    *   (b) notify the new coastal endpoints in the _Gazette_; and
    
    *   (c) recalculate the allocation entitlements of the iwi concerned in accordance with subclause (4).
    
    (4) For the purposes of subclause (3)(c), the trustee must---
        
    *   (a) recalculate the allocation entitlements of the iwi concerned by using the data from the original verified claims of each iwi together with the new coastal endpoints; and
    
    *   (b) record these new entitlements on the iwi aquaculture register together with the date of registration; and
    
    *   (c) record the cancellation of the entitlements being replaced and the relevant date; and
    
    *   (d) use the new entitlements only for the allocation of settlement assets received after the date on which the alteration to the planning area becomes operative.
    
    

##### 13 Decision rules for computation model
    
*   The calculation of coastline lengths must be based on the following decision rules in relation to the specified geographical features:
        
    *   ###### River mouth
    
    *   (a) rivers are cut off where the mean high-water mark meets the natural entrance points of the river, and the distance across the river mouth is included in the coastline length:
    
    *   ###### Bays
    
    *   (b) a bay is an indentation of the coast---
            
        *   (i) the area of which is not less than the area of a semicircle with a diameter drawn across the mouth of the indentation; and
        
        *   (ii) the length of the diameter referred to in subparagraph (i) is 10 km or less:
        
        
    
    *   (c) the straight line drawn across the mouth of a bay is substituted for the actual coastline of the bay in the calculation of coastline length:
    
    *   (d) the presence of islands at the mouth of, or within, an indentation does not affect the calculations necessary to determine whether an indentation is a bay:
    
    *   ###### Offshore islands
    
    *   (e) an offshore island is a naturally formed area of land that, at mean high-water tides, is---
            
        *   (i) surrounded by water; but
        
        *   (ii) not submerged by water:
        
        
    
    *   (f) the coastlines of the following offshore islands must be counted as coastlines of the relevant regional coastlines:
            
        *   (i) Stewart/Rakiura:
        
        *   (ii) Great Barrier/Aotea:
        
        *   (iii) Motiti:
        
        
    
    *   (g) the coastlines of other offshore islands must be counted as part of the relevant regional coastline if the trustee is satisfied that 1 or more iwi have---
            
        *   (i) ahi kaaroa (both long-term and current habitation on the island); and
        
        *   (ii) a traditional and separate fishery associated with the island; and
        
        *   (iii) current occupation of the island, as shown by the presence of marae and other communal structures:
        
        
    
    *   ###### Chatham Islands
    
    *   (h) for the purpose of calculating the coastline in the Chatham Islands, only the coastlines of the following islands are relevant:
            
        *   (i) Chatham Island; and
        
        *   (ii) Pitt Island.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Maori Commercial Aquaculture Claims Settlement Act 2004\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 October 2011, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][146] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][147] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][148] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][149] and [17E][150] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
