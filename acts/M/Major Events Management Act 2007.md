    ###### **Example**

    Company A pays Company B to produce hats with writing on them that states "Company A---proud to bring you the 2007 Football World Cup".
    
    Neither Company A nor Company B has the written authorisation of the major event organiser for Company A's representation of an association between itself and the Football World Cup.
    
    Both Company A and Company B are in breach of section 10\.

##### 11 Presumption if major event emblems or words are used
    
*   (1) The court may presume that a representation is in breach of [section 10][14] if it includes any of the following:
        
    *   (a) a major event emblem; or
    
    *   (b) a major event word or major event words; or
    
    *   (c) a representation that so closely resembles a major event emblem, a major event word, or major event words as to be likely to deceive or confuse a reasonable person.
    
    (2) Subsection (1) applies even if the representation is qualified by words like ""unauthorised"" or ""unofficial"", or other words that are intended to defeat the purpose of [section 10][14].

##### 12 Exceptions to sections 10 and 11
    
*   (1) [Sections 10][14] and [11][15] do not apply if---
        
    *   (a) the association between the major event and the goods, services, brand of goods or services, or person who provides goods or services has the written authorisation of the major event organiser; or
    
    *   (b) the representation has the written authorisation of the major event organiser; or
    
    *   (c) the representation is of personal opinion made by a natural person for no commercial gain; or
    
    *   (d) in accordance with honest practices in industrial or commercial matters, the representation---
            
        *   (i) is necessary to indicate the intended purpose of goods or services; or
        
        *   (ii) is made by an existing organisation continuing to carry out its ordinary activities; or
        
        *   (iii) is for the purposes of reporting news, information, criticism, or a review (including promoting that news, information, criticism, or review) in a newspaper or magazine, or by means of television, radio, film, the Internet, or other means of reporting; or
        
        *   (iv) in the case of a word or emblem (provided that the word or emblem is not being used in combination with other words or emblems with the intention of suggesting an association that breaches [section 10][14]), comprises the whole or part of---
                
            *   (A) the proper name of any town or road or other place in New Zealand; or
            
            *   (B) the legal or trade name (not being used for the purpose of defeating the intention of this subpart) of the person making the representation; or
            
            *   (C) an existing registered trade mark.
            
            
        
        
    
    (2) Nothing in subsection (1)(d)(iii) authorises a person to make a representation in a way likely to suggest to a reasonable person that there is an association between news, information, criticism, or a review about a major event and---
        
    *   (a) goods or services; or
    
    *   (b) a brand of goods or services; or
    
    *   (c) a person who provides goods or services.
    
    ###### **Examples**
    
    The Football World Cup finals are to be held in New Zealand in 2007\. The Football World Cup finals are declared to be a major event under section 7\.
    
    All combinations of the words "Football", "World", and "Cup" are declared to be major event words under section 8\.
    
    **Example 1**
    
    The World's Best Cup Makers Limited is a New Zealand business that was established in 1982\. For many years it has advertised itself with a slogan that states "Maker of cups and trophies for all sporting events, from football to synchronised swimming!" and a logo that shows a football player kicking a football. The World's Best Cup Makers Limited continues to operate and promote itself in this way during the period when the Football World Cup finals are held in New Zealand.
    
    The World's Best Cup Makers Limited does not have the written authorisation of the major event organiser for the use of its company name, its advertising, its slogan, or its logo.
    
    This is not a breach of section 10 because of the exception in section 12(1)(d)(ii).
    
    **Example 2**
    
    Daily Newspaper A produces a 20-page Football World Cup supplement. It contains a schedule of the games to be played during the Football World Cup finals, an explanation of the rules of football, and details about each of the teams and the players and coaches in each of those teams. The supplement also contains a lot of advertising, none of which breaches section 10\. However, Company B has paid Daily Newspaper A for the right to state on the cover of the supplement "Coverage of the Football World Cup finals is brought to you by Company B".
    
    Neither Daily Newspaper A nor Company B has the written authorisation of the major event organiser for Company B's statement on the cover of the supplement.
    
    The content of the supplement and the advertising within it does not breach section 10 because of the exception in section 12(1)(d)(iii). However, both Daily Newspaper A and Company B are in breach of section 10 because of Company B's statement on the cover of the supplement.
    
    Compare: 1981 No 47 [s 20A(3)][119]; 2002 No 49 [s 95][120]; London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Act 2006 Schedule 4 cl 1(2)(b) (UK)

##### 13 Offences and penalty for breach of section 10
    
*   (1) Every person commits an offence who knowingly breaches [section 10][14].

    ###### **Examples**
    
    The Football World Cup finals are to be held in New Zealand in 2007\. The Football World Cup finals are declared to be a major event under section 7\.
    
    **Example 1: Clean zone and clean period**
    
    The final game of the Football World Cup is to be held at the rugby stadium located in Phillipstown in Christchurch between 3 pm and 7 pm on Saturday, 9 June 2007\.
    
    The Police and the Christchurch City Council have decided, in the particular circumstances of this major event activity, that in order to host safely the final game of the Football World Cup, it is necessary to close Stevens Street, Talfourd Place, and Lismore Street to vehicles from 12.01 am to 11.59 pm on Saturday, 9 June 2007\. Falsgrove Street (between Lismore Street and Stevens Street) will also be closed for parts of that day.
    
    After taking into account the matters set out in section 16(2) and looking at the requirements of the particular event, the Economic Development Minister decides to declare a clean zone and a clean period for the final game of the Football World Cup in accordance with section 16(1).
    
    The Minister declares the clean zone to be the area bordered by, and including, the footpaths on the north side of Stevens Street, the west side of Wilsons Road North (between Stevens Street and Lismore Street), the south side of Lismore Street (between Wilsons Road North and Falsgrove Street), and the west side of Falsgrove Street (between Lismore Street and Stevens Street).
    
    The stadium and its surrounds, including the stadium car park, (all of which are within the area described above) are included in the clean zone. However, none of the private land or private buildings within the area described above is included in the clean zone.
    
    The Minister declares the clean period for this clean zone to start at 12.01 am on Saturday, 9 June 2007 and finish at 11.59 pm on Saturday, 9 June 2007\.
    
    **Example 2: Clean transport routes and clean periods**
    
    In accordance with section 16(1), the Economic Development Minister also decides to declare 2 clean transport routes and a clean period for the final game of the Football World Cup.
    
    State Highway 73 and the Christchurch Southern Motorway 73 are declared to be a clean transport route from the point on the Christchurch Southern Motorway that is 5 km in a straight line (in a south-westerly direction) from the corner of Falsgrove and Lismore Street, to the point on State Highway 73 that is 5 km in a straight line (in a south-easterly direction) from the corner of Lismore Street and Wilsons Road North.
    
    All of State Highway 74A is within 5 km of the clean zone and therefore all of this highway is also declared to be a clean transport route.
    
    Both clean transport routes are declared to include the areas directly proximate to the highways and motorway that do not consist of private land or private buildings.
    
    It appears that very few people will be using the railway lines to the north of State Highway 73 to travel to or from the clean zone. Therefore, the Minister decides not to declare this railway line to be a clean transport route.
    
    The clean period for the clean transport routes is declared to start at 8 am on Saturday, 9 June 2007 and finish at 11 pm on Saturday, 9 June 2007\.
    
    Section 16(4)(b)(i): amended, on 1 August 2008, by [section 50(1)][127] of the Land Transport Management Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No 47).

    Neither Company A nor Company B has the written authorisation of the major event organiser for this advertising.
    
    Both Company A and Company B are in breach of section 18 during the clean period.
    
    **Example 2**
    
    Company A pays Company B to undertake an advertising campaign on its behalf. Accordingly, Company B hires people to stand on Lancaster Street, just outside the clean zone, and give away T-shirts to people as they enter the clean zone in order to watch the final game of the Football World Cup.

    Two weeks before the final game of the Football World Cup is held, Company X places an advertisement advertising its products on a billboard on Lancaster Street, about 50 m outside the clean zone. The billboard faces away from the clean zone so that, although the back of the billboard is clearly visible from within the clean zone, the advertising on the billboard cannot be seen from within the clean zone. The billboard is not in a clean transport route.
    
    Company X does not have the written authorisation of the major event organiser for this advertising.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Major Events Management Act 2007\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 October 2012, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][191] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][192] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][193] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][194] and [17E][195] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
