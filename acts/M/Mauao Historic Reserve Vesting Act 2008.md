    (6) Legislation is required to enable Mauao historic reserve to be vested in the trustees of the Mauao Trust and the Crown's conditions in relation to the vesting to be met:
    
    (7) An agreement to introduce vesting legislation in relation to Mauao, dated 11 August 2007, was signed by the Minister of Māori Affairs, representatives of Ngāi Te Rangi, Ngāti Ranginui, Ngāti Pūkenga, and Waitaha, and the trustees of the Mauao Trust:

## Schedule 1  
Description of Mauao historic reserve

[s 3][5]

75.6658 hectares, more or less, being part Section 1, Section 3, and Section 12, Block VI, Tauranga Survey District as shown on SO Plans 4802 and 51477\.

---

## Schedule 2  
Encumbrances

[s 5(1)(b)][9]

*   1 The right of the Tauranga City Council to construct and operate on Mauao historic reserve a firefighting water line, and to include an additional power cable duct within the firefighting water line trench (Tauranga City Council Resource Consent No 1581; details of easement concerned shown on DP 368290).

    *   (a) the existing water reservoir (comprising 2437 square metres, being Section 1 SO Plan 400511) for a 60-year period (by lease dated 18 April 2008, granted by the Department of Conservation to Tauranga City Council); and

---

## Schedule 3  
Statement of recognition of Waitaha's ancestral associations and historical connections with Mauao

[s 13(1)][22]

This statement of recognition reflects the history to which Waitaha subscribes, but it does not recount that history in full. Waitaha's history will sit alongside other iwi and hapū histories and altogether these histories make up the diverse relationships that are attributed to Mauao.

For Waitaha, that place is borne of the occupation of the maunga by Tutauaroa (the son of Waitaha), his son Taiwhanake, and Taiwhanake's son Kinonui. Tutauaroa moved to Otamarakau, leaving Taiwhanake to maintain Waitaha's presence on Mauao. Ngāti Ranginui and Waitaha occupied Mauao, later followed by Ngāi Te Rangi after the Battle of Kokowai. Mauao continues to be an integral part of Waitaha's history and their tribal future.

For Waitaha, the enduring protection of Waitaha's ancestral associations and historical connections with Mauao is paramount.
