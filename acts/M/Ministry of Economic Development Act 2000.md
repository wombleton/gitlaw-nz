##### Notes


###### 1 General
    
*   
    
    
    This is a reprint of the Ministry of Economic Development
    Act 2000\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as
    at 7 September 2000, as specified in the list of amendments at
    the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that have
    yet to come into force or that contain relevant transitional or savings
    provisions are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological
    order.
    



###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   
    
    
    Under [section 16D][30] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act
    1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the
    date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and
    by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even
    though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations
    Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official
    volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal
    enactment and its amendments are contained.
    



###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   
    
    
    A number of editorial conventions are followed in the
    preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included
    in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted.
    For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/
    or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts
    and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in
    Force_.
    



###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations
Publication Act 1989
    
*   
    
    
    [Section
    17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out
    in [sections 17D][31] and [17E][32] of that Act
    so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted
    enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice.
    Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January
    2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since
    1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of
    the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation
    reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation
    and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under
    the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act
    1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where
    relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
    
        
    *   
        
        •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   
        
        •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
        
    *   
        
        •layout of provisions, including:
        
            
        *   
            
            •indentation
        *   
            
            •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear
            above the section)
            
        
        
        
    *   
        
        •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type,
        without quotation marks)
    *   
        
        •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   
        
        •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page
        of each Act)
    *   
        
        •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
        
    *   
        
        •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals,
        and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   
        
        •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
        
            
        *   
            
            •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared
            with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are
            amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word
            (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
            
        *   
            
            •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now
            capital letters
            
        
        
        
    *   
        
        •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule),
        and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   
        
        •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
        
    *   
        
        •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules
        of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather
        than chronological).
