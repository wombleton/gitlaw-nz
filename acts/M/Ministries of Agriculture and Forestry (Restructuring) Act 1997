##### 14 Penalty for failure to pay statutory fees, etc
    
*   (1) In this section and in [sections 15 to 17][19], _statutory debt_ means any fee, charge, or levy required by any enactment administered in the new Ministry or by any regulation, order, notice, direction, or other instrument made or issued under any such enactment (other than an enactment that provides for the payment of interest or a monetary penalty for late payment of, or failure or refusal to pay, the fee, charge, or levy), to be paid to the Ministry or the holder of any specified office.
    
    (2) If, after the expiration of the time provided by the enactment concerned (or by subsection (4)), all or any part of a statutory debt remains unpaid, the debt is deemed to have been increased by an amount calculated in accordance with subsection (3).
    
    (3) The amount by which an unpaid statutory debt, or any unpaid part of a statutory debt, is deemed to have been increased is the sum of---
        
    *   (a) 10% of the debt (or that part of the debt that remained unpaid after the expiry of the time provided for the debt's payment); and
    
    *   (b) for every complete period of 6 months after that expiry during which the debt or any part of it (including any deemed increase calculated under this subsection) has remained unpaid, 10% of the debt or that part.
    
    (4) If no time is otherwise provided by any enactment for the payment of statutory debts of any kind or description, the debt must be paid within 20 working days of its being demanded in writing from the person required to pay it by any employee of the new Ministry.
    
    (5) When the Ministry notifies a person of the incurring of a statutory debt, it must also notify that person of the consequences of non-payment under this section.
    
    (6) This section applies only in respect of statutory debts that first arise after the commencement of this Act.

##### 15 Waiver of penalty
    
*   (1) If the chief executive is satisfied that the failure or refusal of any person to pay all or any part of a statutory debt was a result of a genuine dispute between the person and the Ministry as to---
        
    *   (a) the person's liability to pay the debt; or
    
    *   (b) the amount of the debt; or

    (2) If, in any action for the recovery of a statutory debt, the court is satisfied that the failure or refusal of any person to pay all or any part of a statutory debt was a result of a genuine dispute between the person and the Ministry as to---

    *   (b) the amount of the debt; or

    *   (b) the time provided by the enactment concerned (or by [section 14(4)][18]) for the debt's payment has expired; and
    
    *   (c) the debt or any part of it has not been paid,---
    
    the chief executive may give to the person liable to pay the debt written notice that, unless within 10 working days the person pays the debt or part, or satisfies the chief executive that it is not payable, the chief executive may withdraw, or refuse to provide the person with, service of the kind to which the debt relates.
    
    (2) If---
        
    *   (a) 10 or more working days have expired since the chief executive gave any person notice under subsection (1); and
    
    *   (b) the person concerned has neither paid the statutory debt or part concerned nor satisfied the chief executive that it is not payable,---
    
    the chief executive may, after causing the person to be sent by registered mail or given orally a notice that the chief executive has decided to do so, withdraw or refuse to provide the service concerned.
    
    (3) If the chief executive has under subsection (2) withdrawn or refused to supply a service, the chief executive is not required to reinstate or supply it until---
        
    *   (a) a court holds that the debt or part concerned is paid; or
    
    *   (b) a court holds that the debt or part is not payable; or

    then, subject to subsection (2), to the extent that the amount of the increase has been received, it is to be paid to the person or body.
    
    (2) If, pursuant to any enactment administered in the new Ministry, the chief executive collects any levy (however described) and pays it to any person or persons, then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the enactment, the chief executive is to deduct from the amounts of levy collected the actual and reasonable costs to the Ministry of the collection of those amounts and the making of payments, and pay only the residue (or, if the amounts collected are payable to more than 1 person, the appropriate proportion of the residue) to each person concerned.
    
    (3) When paying to any person an amount from which a deduction has been made under subsection (2), the chief executive must give the person---
        
    *   (a) accounts, showing the deductions made and how they have been calculated; and

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Ministries of Agriculture and Forestry (Restructuring) Act 1997\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 11 December 1997, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][34] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][35] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][36] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][37] and [17E][38] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
