#### Procedure after temporary non-contact order made

##### 19 Offender may require hearing
    
*   (1) Where the court makes a temporary non-contact order, the offender is entitled to notify the court that he or she wishes to be heard on whether a final non-contact order should be substituted for the temporary non-contact order.
    
    (2) The temporary non-contact order must contain a notice to the offender that clearly states---
        
    *   (a) the offender's right under subsection (1); and
    
    *   (b) that, subject to [section 21][29], if the offender does not take any steps in the proceedings, the temporary non-contact order becomes a final non-contact order by operation of law 3 months after the date on which it was made.
    
    (3) If, under subsection (1), the offender notifies the court that he or she wishes to be heard, the Registrar of the court must assign a hearing date, which must be---
        
    *   (a) as soon as practicable; and
    
    *   (b) unless there are special circumstances, not later than 42 days after receipt of the offender's notice.
    
    

##### 20 Procedure where offender does not require hearing
    
*   (1) If the offender does not notify the court under [section 19][27] that he or she wishes to be heard then, unless the temporary non-contact order is earlier discharged, the order becomes a final non-contact order by operation of law 3 months after the date on which it is made.
    
    (2) However, a temporary non-contact order does not become a final non-contact order under subsection (1) unless the offender has been served with a copy of the order at least 10 days before the 3-month period specified in subsection (1) elapses.
    
    (3) If, pursuant to subsection (2), a temporary non-contact order does not become a final non-contact order, the court may from time to time extend the period within which the temporary non-contact order may be served and the temporary non-contact order continues in force until the expiry of any such extensions.
    
    (4) Any extension or extensions under subsection (3) may not extend the period within which a temporary non-contact order may be served by more than 3 months in total.
    
    (5) If the period for service of a temporary non-contact order has been extended under subsection (3) and at the expiry of that period the temporary non-contact order has not been served, the order lapses.

##### 21 Court may require hearing before order becomes final
    
*   (1) If, on or after making a temporary non-contact order, the court considers that there is good reason why the order should not become final in accordance with [section 20(1)][28] without a hearing at which the victim or the offender, or both, are present or represented, the court, of its own motion, may direct that there be a hearing.
    
    (2) A direction made under subsection (1) may be made even though the offender does not wish to be heard.
    
    (3) If, pursuant to subsection (1), the court directs that there be a hearing, the Registrar must assign a hearing date as soon as practicable.
    
    (4) If the court makes a direction under subsection (1), it may issue a summons requiring the offender to attend the court at a place and time specified in the summons.

##### 22 Procedure where hearing required
    
*   If, pursuant to [section 19][27], the offender notifies the court that he or she wishes to be heard, or in any other case where a hearing is required or held, the court may at the hearing---
        
    *   (a) discharge the temporary non-contact order; or
    
    *   (b) make the temporary non-contact order a final non-contact order (with or without variation).
    
    

#### Enforcement of non-contact orders

##### 23 Copies of orders to be sent to Police
    
*   (1) This section applies to the following orders:
