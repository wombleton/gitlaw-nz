*   
    
    
    
    (1) The employment
    of any person deemed to have been transferred by [section 10][14] is to be on terms

    to the employee at the date of transfer.
    
    
    (2) Any unexpired
    collective employment contract which covers transferred employees

        made in respect of Valuation New Zealand Limited or Land Information
        New Zealand, as the case may be; and

    agreement between the employee and the company or (as the case may
    be) the department's chief executive.
    
    
    (4) Every employee
    deemed by [section 10][14] to have been transferred
    to Valuation New Zealand Limited or to Land Information New Zealand
    becomes an employee of the relevant entity on the date of the transfer,
    but, for the purposes of every enactment, law, contract, and agreement
    relating to the employment of each such employee,---
    
    *   (a) the contract of employment of that employee
        that applied immediately before the commencement of this Act in respect
        of that person's employment in the Valuation Department is deemed
        to have been unbroken; and
        
    
    
    
    *   (b) the employee's period of service with
        the Valuation Department, and every other period of service of that
        employee that was recognised by the Department as continuous service,
        is deemed to have been a period of service with Valuation New Zealand
        Limited or Land Information New Zealand, as the case may be.

    is entitled to any compensation for redundancy by reason only of the
    person ceasing to be employed by the Valuation Department.
    
    
    



##### 13 Membership of Government Superannuation Fund
    
*

    deemed by [section 10][14] to have been transferred
    to Valuation New Zealand Limited was a contributor to the Government
    Superannuation Fund under the [Government Superannuation Fund Act 1956][24] immediately before
    that transfer,---
    
    *   (a) that person is deemed for the purposes
        of that Act to be employed in the Government service for so long as
        the person continues to be employed by the company; and
        
        
    
    
    
    *   (b) that Act is deemed to apply to the person
        in all respects as if the person's service with the Government service
        were continuous.

##### Notes


###### 1 General
    
*   
    
    
    This is a reprint of the Valuation Department (Restructuring)
    Act 1998\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as
    at 25 January 2005, as specified in the list of amendments at
    the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that have
    yet to come into force or that contain relevant transitional or savings
    provisions are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological
    order.
    



###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   
    
    
    Under [section 16D][25] of the Acts and Regulations Publication
    Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date
    of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by
    the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though
    editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations
    Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official
    volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal
    enactment and its amendments are contained.
    



###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   
    
    
    A number of editorial conventions are followed in the
    preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included
    in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted.
    For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/
    or Part 8 of the _Tables of Acts and Ordinances
    and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.
    



###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations
Publication Act 1989
    
*   
    
    
    [Section
    17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act
    1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set
    out in [sections
    17D][26] and [17E][27] of that Act so that, to the
    extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment
    is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes
    that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January
    2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since
    1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation
    reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation
    and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under
    the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication
    Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant,
    in the preparation of this reprint:
    
        
    *   
        
        •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   
        
        •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
        
    *   
        
        •layout of provisions, including:
        
            
        *   
            
            •indentation
        *   
            
            •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear
            above the section)
            
        
        
        
    *   
        
        •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type,
        without quotation marks)
    *   
        
        •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   
        
        •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page
        of each Act)
    *   
        
        •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
        
    *   
        
        •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals,
        and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   
        
        •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
        
            
        *   
            
            •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared
            with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are
            amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word
            (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
            
        *   
            
            •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now
            capital letters
            
        
        
        
    *   
        
        •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule),
        and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   
        
        •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
        
    *   
        
        •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules
        of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather
        than chronological).
