##### 3 Transfer of employees
    
*   
    
    
    
    (1) On taking
    up his or her duties in the Defence Force, a transferred employee
    (including the person designated by the Chief of Defence Force as
    the Secretary for War Pensions) must be treated as being appointed
    to the Civil Staff of the Defence Force under [section 61A][22] of the Defence Act 1990\.
    
    
    (2) The transfer
    of a transferred employee to the Defence Force is subject to any relevant
    transfer provisions of the employment contract applying to that employee.
    
    
    (3) This section
    applies despite [section 61A][23] of the State Sector Act 1988\.
    
    
    



##### 4 Protection of terms and conditions of employment
on transfer
    
*   
    
    
    
    (1) The employment
    of a transferred employee in the Defence Force must be on terms and
    conditions no less favourable to the transferred employee than those
    applying to the employee at the date of transfer.
    
    
    (2) Any unexpired
    collective employment contract that covers a transferred employee
    continues, as from the date of transfer, to apply on the same terms---
    
    *   (a) as if it were a contract that had been
        made in respect of the Defence Force; and
        
    
    
    
    *   (b) as if it were binding both on that employee
        and on the Chief of Defence Force.
        
    
    
    
    
    (3) Subsections
    (1) and (2) cease to apply to a transferred employee if the terms
    and conditions of employment that apply under the employment contract
    applying to the employee at the date of the transfer are varied by
    agreement between the employee and the Chief of Defence Force.
    
    
    (4) Subsection
    (1) ceases to apply to a transferred employee who, after the transfer,
    receives any subsequent appointment within the Defence Force.
    
    
    



##### 5 Employment to be continuous
    
*   
    
    
    
    For the purposes
    of any provisions of a transferred employee's employment contract
    relating to continuity of service, that employee's transfer to the
    Defence Force is insufficient by itself to break his or her employment.
    
    
    



##### 6 Membership of Government Superannuation Fund
    
*   
    
    
    
    If a transferred
    employee was a contributor to the Government Superannuation Fund under
    the [Government Superannuation Fund Act 1956][24] immediately before
    the date of his or her transfer to the Defence Force,---
    
    *   (a) that person must be treated for the purposes
        of that Act as being employed in the Government service for so long
        as the person continues to be employed by the Defence Force; and
        
        
    
    
    
    *   (b) that Act applies to the person in all
        respects as if the person's service with the Defence Force is Government
        service.
        
    
    
    
    
    



##### 7 Transfer not sufficient to entitle employee to redundancy
or severance payment
    
*   
    
    
    
    No transferred
    employee is entitled to receive any compensation for redundancy or
    any severance payment because---
    
    *   (a) the position held by that employee immediately
        before the transfer has ceased to exist; or
        
    
    
    
    *   (b) he or she has ceased by virtue of that
        transfer to be an employee of a department under the [State Sector Act 1988][25].

    by or against the person who is for the time being the responsible
    Minister under that Act.
    
    
    (2) If, before
    the commencement of this Act, the chief executive of the department

##### Notes


###### 1 General
    
*   
    
    
    This is a reprint of the Veterans' Affairs Act 1999\. The
    reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 15 April
    2003, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that have
    yet to come into force or that contain relevant transitional or savings
    provisions are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological
    order.
    



###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   
    
    
    Under [section 16D][29] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act
    1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the
    date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and
    by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even
    though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations
    Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official
    volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal
    enactment and its amendments are contained.
    



###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   
    
    
    A number of editorial conventions are followed in the
    preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included
    in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted.
    For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/
    or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts
    and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in
    Force_.
    



###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations
Publication Act 1989
    
*   
    
    
    [Section
    17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out
    in [sections 17D][30] and [17E][31] of that Act
    so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted
    enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice.
    Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January
    2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since
    1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of
    the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation
    reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation
    and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under
    the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act
    1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where
    relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
    
        
    *   
        
        •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   
        
        •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
        
    *   
        
        •layout of provisions, including:
        
            
        *   
            
            •indentation
        *   
            
            •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear
            above the section)
            
        
        
        
    *   
        
        •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type,
        without quotation marks)
    *   
        
        •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   
        
        •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page
        of each Act)
    *   
        
        •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
        
    *   
        
        •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals,
        and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   
        
        •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
        
            
        *   
            
            •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared
            with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are
            amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word
            (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
            
        *   
            
            •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now
            capital letters
            
        
        
        
    *   
        
        •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule),
        and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   
        
        •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
        
    *   
        
        •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules
        of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather
        than chronological).
