## Part 2  
Provisions relating to treatment and rights of victims generally

#### Principles guiding treatment of victims

##### 7 Treatment
    
*   Any person who deals with a victim (for example, a judicial officer, lawyer, member of court staff, Police employee, or other official) should---
        
    *   (a) treat the victim with courtesy and compassion; and
    
    *   (b) respect the victim's dignity and privacy.
    
    Compare: 1987 No 173 s 3
    
    Section 7: amended, on 1 October 2008, by [section 130(1)][96] of the Policing Act 2008 (2008 No 72).

##### 8 Access to services
    
*   A victim or member of a victim's family who has welfare, health, counselling, medical, or legal needs arising from the offence should have access to services that are responsive to those needs.
    
    Compare: 1987 No 173 s 4

##### 9 Meetings to resolve issues relating to offence
    
*   (1) If a suitable person is available to arrange and facilitate a meeting between a victim and an offender to resolve issues relating to the offence, a judicial officer, lawyer for an offender, member of court staff, probation officer, or prosecutor should, if he or she is satisfied of the matters stated in subsection (2), encourage the holding of a meeting of that kind.
    
    (2) The matters are---
        
    *   (a) that the victim and offender agree to the holding of a meeting of that kind; and
    
    *   (b) that the resources required for a meeting of that kind to be arranged, facilitated, and held, are available; and
    
    *   (c) that the holding of a meeting of that kind is otherwise practicable, and is in all the circumstances appropriate.
    
    

##### 10 Enforceability of principles
    
*   [Sections 7 to 9][10], and the principles in them guiding the treatment of victims, do not confer on any person any legal right that is enforceable, for example, in a court of law.
    
    Compare: 1993 No 28 [s 11(2)][97]

#### Information to be given to victims

##### 11 Information about programmes, remedies, and services
    
*   (1) A victim must, as soon as practicable after the victim comes into contact with an agency, be given information by the personnel of the agency about programmes, remedies, or services available to the victim through the agency.
    
    (2) In this section, _agency_ means---
        
    *   (a) the Accident Compensation Corporation:

    *   (f) the New Zealand Police.
    
    (3) Nothing in this section prevents information of a kind that, under this section, must be given to a victim of an offence, from also being given to any other person (for example, to a person who was disadvantaged by the offence).
    
    Section 11(2)(c): amended, on 1 October 2003, pursuant to [section 14(1)][99] of the State Sector Amendment Act 2003 (2003 No 41).
    
    Section 11(2)(d): amended (with effect on 1 October 2001), on 1 August 2003, pursuant to [section 13(1)][100] of the State Sector Amendment Act 2003 (2003 No 41).

##### 12 Information about proceedings
    
*   (1) A victim must, as soon as practicable, be given information by investigating authorities or, as the case requires, by members of court staff, or the prosecutor, about the following matters:
        
    *   (a) the progress of the investigation of the offence:
    
    *   (b) the charges laid or reasons for not laying charges, and all changes to the charges laid:
    
    *   (c) the victim's role as a witness in the prosecution of the offence:
    
    *   (d) the date and place of each event listed in subsection (2):
    
    *   (e) every final disposition of all proceedings (at first instance or on appeal (if any)) relating to the offence, for example---
            
        *   (i) any convictions or pleas of guilty entered, and sentences imposed, in relation to the offence; or
        
        *   (ii) any acquittal or deemed acquittal or finding that the charge was not proved; but not
        
        *   (iii) whether the accused or offender is granted bail.
        
        
    
    (2) The events referred to in subsection (1)(d) are---
        
    *   (a) the first appearance in court, in connection with the offence, of the person accused of the offence:
    
    *   (b) any preliminary hearing relating to the offence:
    
    *   (c) any defended hearing, or trial, relating to the offence:
    
    *   (d) any hearings set down for sentencing for the offence:
    
    *   (e) any hearings of appeals (if any) against conviction of the offence, or against the sentence imposed, or to be imposed, for the offence, or both.
    
    (3) Nothing in this section prevents information of a kind that, under this section, must be given to a victim of an offence, from also being given to any other person (for example, to a person who was disadvantaged by the offence).
    
    (4) In this section, _investigating authorities_ means persons or bodies investigating the offence in the performance or exercise of their official functions, powers, or duties; but does not include a person exercising or performing functions, powers, or duties of a probation officer under the [Criminal Justice Act 1985][101] or any other enactment.
    
    Compare: 1987 No 173 s 6

##### 13 Limits on duties to give information under sections 11 and 12
    
*   (1) Nothing in [section 11][15] or [section 12][16] requires any person to give information if good reason for withholding the information would exist under any of [sections 6][102], [7][103], and [9][104] of the Official Information Act 1982, if a request for that information were made under that Act.
    
    (2) An example of a case where good reason of that kind for withholding information would exist is where the giving of the information would be likely to prejudice the maintenance of the law, including the prevention, investigation, and detection of offences, and the right to a fair trial.
    
    (3) Nothing in [section 11][15] or [section 12][16] affects any enactment, rule of law, or order or direction of a court that prohibits or restricts the making available of information of a kind referred to in section 11 or section 12 (for example, one forbidding the publication, in a report or account of proceedings in respect of an offence, of the name of, or of any particulars likely to identify, a participant in the proceedings).

##### 14 Information may be given to victim's support person
    
*   Information required to be given under [section 11][15] or [section 12][16] may be given to a support person of a victim if the victim---
        
    *   (a) cannot receive it; or
    
    *   (b) is not, or may not be, capable alone of understanding it.
    
    

#### Privacy of victims

##### 15 Victim's rights under Privacy Act 1993
    
*   (1) No person may interfere with the privacy of a victim contrary to the [Privacy Act 1993][105].
    
    (2) This section is not limited by [section 7][10], and does not limit or affect, or give any person any rights separate from, or additional to, the [Privacy Act 1993][105].

##### 16 Restriction on giving victim's precise address in evidence or information provided to court
    
*   (1) This section applies to information (the _information_) that identifies, or that may lead to the identification of, the address of the place where the victim lives (for example, his or her postal address, email address, fax number, or phone number).
    
    (2) The information may be given in evidence or in information provided to a court only with the leave of the judicial officer.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Victims' Rights Act 2002\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 5 March 2012, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][173] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][174] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][175] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][176] and [17E][177] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
