#### VANZ's general duties

##### 11 VANZ to perform functions and exercise powers on reasonable grounds and in a timely manner
    
*   (1) VANZ must perform its functions and exercise its powers on reasonable grounds and in a timely manner, having regard to the requirements of this Act, the nature of the function or power, and all the circumstances.
    
    (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), VANZ is to be treated as responding to a claim in a timely manner if it makes a decision on the claim within 30 working days after receiving the claim.
    
    (3) However, the 30 working days does not include any period while VANZ is waiting for a veteran or other claimant to provide further information that VANZ requires to determine whether to accept the claim.

##### 12 VANZ must keep veteran or claimant up to date on progress of claim and give notice of its decision
    
*   (1) VANZ must keep a veteran or claimant up to date on the progress of the veteran's or claimant's claim.
    
    (2) As soon as practicable after making a decision on a claim, VANZ must give notice of its decision on the claim to the claimant.
    
    (3) Every notice given under this section must---
        
    *   (a) be in writing; and

*   VANZ must tell a claimant that he or she has the right to apply for a review of any of VANZ's decisions on the claim, and must do so at a time appropriate to enable the claimant to exercise the right.

#### How claims are to be decided

##### 14 Process for deciding claims
    
*   (1) This section sets out the sequential steps to be taken in deciding whether a claim under this Act is accepted.
    
    (2) The first step is to---
        
    *   (a) consider all the available material that is relevant; and
    
    *   (b) decide whether the material is consistent with an hypothesis that the veteran's injury, illness, or death was service-related.
    
    (3) If the material is consistent with an hypothesis as specified in subsection (2), the second step is to decide whether there is a statement of principles that applies.
    
    (4) If there is no statement of principles that applies, [section 15][21] applies.
    
    (5) If there is a statement of principles that applies, the third step is to decide whether the hypothesis is consistent with the statement of principles.
    
    (6) If the hypothesis is consistent with the statement of principles, the fourth step is to accept the claim, unless there are reasonable grounds for believing that the veteran's injury, illness, or death was not service-related.
    
    (7) In this section and [section 15][21], _statement of principles_ means a statement of principles that, under [section 22][30](6) and regulations made under [section 265][335], applies for the purposes of this Act.

##### 15 Where no statement of principles applies
    
*   (1) This section applies if, under [section 14][20](4), there is no applicable statement of principles.
    
    (2) The person deciding whether to accept the claim must decide whether the claim is consistent with an hypothesis that is reasonable.
    
    (3) If the claim is consistent with an hypothesis that is reasonable, then the claim must be accepted, unless there are reasonable grounds for believing that the veteran's injury, illness, or death was not service-related.
    
    (4) An hypothesis is reasonable if it is---
        
    *   (a) more than a possibility; and
    
    *   (b) consistent with the known facts; and
    
    *   (c) not inconsistent with proved or known scientific facts.
    
    

##### 16 Process in sections 14 and 15 subject to other sections
    
*   The process set out in [sections 14][20] and [15][21] applies to the extent that it is not modified or overtaken by the presumptions in [sections 17][24] to [21][28] or the provisions of [section 28][39].

#### Presumptions

##### 17 Presumption of physical and mental fitness for service
    
*   (1) For the purposes of this Act, a person who is medically assessed by the Defence Force to be physically and mentally fit for service in the armed forces is presumed to be physically and mentally fit for service in the armed forces.
    
    (2) The presumption in subsection (1) is conclusive, but---
        
    *   (a) applies subject to subsection (3); and
    
    *   (b) does not apply if subsection (4) applies.
    
    (3) The presumption in subsection (1) applies subject to any physical or mental condition that---
        
    *   (a) qualifies a person's physical and mental fitness for service in the armed forces; and
    
    *   (b) is noted in writing and given to the person at the time the person's physical and mental fitness is assessed.
    
    (4) The presumption in subsection (1) does not apply if---
        
    *   (a) the person failed to disclose, after proper inquiry of the person, any material facts in relation to his or her physical or mental health or history of physical or mental health; or
    
    *   (b) by reason of any false statement, non-disclosure, or misrepresentation by the person, he or she was incorrectly assessed as physically and mentally fit for service in the armed forces.
    
    

##### 18 Application of section 17(4) to veterans with qualifying operational service
    
*   (1) [Section 17][24](4) does not preclude the production of evidence (whether strictly legal evidence or not) showing that any conditions that resulted in the disablement or death of the person were possibly service-related.
    
    (2) If that evidence is produced, then (in the absence of evidence to the contrary), the person's condition is to be treated as service-related.

##### 19 Presumption that injury, illness, or death due to qualifying operational service
    
*   (1) For the purposes of this Act, a veteran who is injured, becomes ill, or dies is presumed to have been injured, become ill, or died as a result of performing qualifying operational service if the injury, illness, or death occurred while the veteran was performing qualifying operational service.
    
    (2) For the purposes of this Act, the aggravation of an injury or illness of a veteran is presumed to be the result of performing qualifying operational service if---
        
    *   (a) the injury or illness was sustained or suffered before the veteran began performing qualifying operational service; and
    
    *   (b) the injury or illness was recorded in the service medical records before the veteran commenced qualifying operational service, but only where the injury or illness was known to the veteran before commencing qualifying operational service; and
    
    *   (c) the aggravation to the injury or illness occurred during the performance of qualifying operational service.
    
    (3) The presumptions in subsections (1) and (2) are conclusive.

##### 20 Presumption in relation to paired organs
    
*   (1) This section applies if---
        
    *   (a) a veteran suffers the loss of, or the permanent loss of the use of, one of any paired organs of his or her body; and
    
    *   (b) that loss is service-related; and
    
    *   (c) the veteran subsequently loses or suffers impaired efficiency of the other corresponding organ (from whatever cause).
    
    (2) The subsequent loss or impaired efficiency of the corresponding organ is presumed to be service-related.
    
    (3) The presumption in subsection (2) is conclusive.
    
    (4) Regulations may be made under [section 265][335] on the recommendation of the Minister specifying which organs are paired organs for the purposes of this section.
    
    (5) The Minister must not make a recommendation under subsection (4) without first consulting---
        
    *   (a) relevant medical organisations; and
    
    *   (b) the advisory panel; and
    
    *   (c) any other person or organisation that the Minister considers appropriate to consult.
    
    

##### 21 Conclusively presumed injuries, illnesses, and conditions
    
*   (1) Regulations made under section 265 on the recommendation of the Minister may specify injuries, illnesses, and conditions that must be treated as service-related if a veteran has---

    *   (b) served at specified times in, or during specified periods of, or in specified deployments during, qualifying operational service.

*   (1) A veteran (whether resident in New Zealand or overseas) who suffers disablement as a consequence of a service-related injury or illness is entitled to a disablement pension.
    
    (2) However, a veteran is not entitled to a temporary disablement pension unless he or she---
        
    *   (a) is participating in a rehabilitation plan; or
    
    *   (b) has a reasonable excuse for not participating in a rehabilitation plan in relation to the veteran's service-related injury or illness.

*   (1) A veteran becomes entitled to a disablement pension when---
        
    *   (a) the veteran has completed and provided to VANZ an application form provided by VANZ; and
    
    *   (b) the veteran has supplied, in the form required by VANZ, any supporting evidence or information required by VANZ; and
    
    *   (c) VANZ has accepted the application.
    
    (2) If an application is accepted by VANZ, the veteran's entitlement to the disablement pension is to be treated as beginning on the day on which VANZ received the application.

##### 49 Disablement pension temporary unless specified to be permanent
    
*   (1) A disablement pension is temporary unless VANZ, when notifying a veteran that his or her application for a disablement pension has been accepted, notifies the veteran that his or her disablement pension is permanent.
    
    (2) A disablement pension may be notified as permanent if VANZ, on the basis of medical and other relevant evidence, considers that---
        
    *   (a) the veteran's condition is not likely to improve; or
    
    *   (b) the veteran's condition has stabilised or reached its final state.
    
    (3) If a disablement pension is temporary, VANZ must advise a veteran that his or her disablement pension is temporary and must state the date by which the veteran's disablement is to be reassessed. VANZ may, if it considers it appropriate in the circumstances, advise the veteran of a later date by which the veteran's disablement is to be reassessed.
    
    (4) On or before the date specified under subsection (3), VANZ must reassess the veteran's disablement to determine whether---
        
    *   (a) the veteran's disablement pension should be cancelled because the veteran is no longer suffering from a medical condition that entitles him or her to receive a disablement pension; or
    
    *   (b) the veteran's temporary disablement pension should continue because the medical condition that entitles the veteran to receive a disablement pension has not stabilised or reached its final state; or
    
    *   (c) the veteran's temporary disablement pension should be made permanent because the condition causing the veteran's disablement has stabilised or reached its final state.
    
    (5) To avoid doubt, a veteran's temporary disablement pension may be made permanent, even though the veteran is assessed at 0% whole-person impairment and therefore not entitled to a disablement pension, on either or both of the following grounds:
        
    *   (a) the need for ongoing treatment to deal with the effects of the disablement:
    
    *   (b) the potential for the disablement to return or recur.
    
    (6) If VANZ makes a determination under subsection (4)(b), it must notify the veteran of a further date by which the veteran's disablement is to be reassessed.
    
    (7) For the purposes of the reassessment under subsection (6), subsection (4) applies with all necessary modifications as if the reference to the date in subsection (3) were a reference to the date specified under subsection (6).

##### 50 Suspension of temporary disablement pension
    
*   (1) VANZ may suspend payment of a temporary disablement pension to a veteran if VANZ is unable to complete a reassessment of the veteran's disablement under [section 52][69] because the veteran has, without reasonable excuse, not complied with any reasonable requirement by VANZ for the purpose of completing the reassessment.
    
    (2) However, VANZ must not suspend payment of a temporary disablement pension under subsection (1) unless it has given the veteran not less than 28 days' notice in writing that it proposes to suspend payment of the pension.

##### 51 Treatment and rehabilitation during period of temporary disablement pension
    
*   VANZ must, in consultation with a veteran whose disablement pension is temporary, prepare a treatment and rehabilitation plan for the veteran to follow.

##### 52 Reassessment of veteran's disablement
    
*   (1) VANZ may, from time to time, reassess the disablement of a veteran who is receiving a permanent disablement pension.
    
    (2) A reassessment under subsection (1) must not be undertaken earlier than 2 years---
        
    *   (a) after the veteran's disablement pension became permanent; or
    
    *   (b) after the veteran's last whole-person impairment assessment.
    
    (3) However, a reassessment may be undertaken earlier if---
        
    *   (a) the veteran provides medical evidence to the satisfaction of VANZ that the veteran's disablement has increased significantly; or
    
    *   (b) VANZ considers that the veteran's disablement has changed significantly.
    
    (4) For the purposes of subsection (3), a change in disablement is significant if the change in whole-person impairment is 10% or more.

##### 53 Lump sum payment for terminal conditions
    
*   (1) A veteran who is entitled to a disablement pension may elect to---
        
    *   (a) suspend payment of the pension for a period of 12 months; and

    *   (b) only if the veteran produces evidence to the satisfaction of VANZ that the veteran has a terminal medical condition that is a service-related condition.
    
    (3) For the purposes of subsection (1), if VANZ accepts that the veteran may make an election under this section, the 12-month period is to be treated as starting on the day on which VANZ receives the veteran's election.
    
    (4) [Schedule 4][359] contains a consequential amendment to the [Income Tax Act 2007][380] that exempts a lump sum payment under this section from income tax.
    
    (5) If, during the 12-month period, the rate of payment of the disablement pension is adjusted, the veteran is entitled to an additional lump sum payment equal to the difference between---
        
    *   (a) what the veteran received under subsection (1); and
    
    *   (b) what the veteran would have received under subsection (1) had the adjustment to the rate and the date of the adjustment been taken into account when the lump sum was paid.
    
    (6) If a veteran who receives a lump sum payment under this section is still alive at the close of the 12-month period referred to in subsection (1)(b), the veteran is entitled to the maximum disablement pension on and from the day after the close of that period.
    
    (7) In subsection (2)(b) and [section 54][71], _terminal medical condition_ means an advanced progressive disease likely to cause death within the 12-month period referred to in subsection (1).

*   (1) A veteran may apply to VANZ to increase his or her disablement pension to the maximum rate.
    
    (2) VANZ may accept the application if the veteran produces evidence to the satisfaction of VANZ that the veteran has a terminal medical condition that is a service-related medical condition.
    
    (3) This section does not prevent a veteran from subsequently making an election under [section 53][70].

##### 55 Entitlement to disablement pension ceases 28 days after veteran's death
    
*   (1) When a veteran who is receiving a disablement pension dies, the entitlement to the pension ceases at the close of the 28th day after the date on which the veteran dies.
    
    (2) This section does not apply in relation to a veteran who has elected to receive a lump sum payment under [section 53][70] and dies during the 12-month period referred to in that section.

##### 56 Rate of disablement pension
    
*   (1) The rates of the disablement pension are to be set by regulations made under [section 265][335].

    *   (a) the veteran is undergoing any treatment; and
    
    *   (b) VANZ is satisfied that the treatment requires the veteran to live away from home or be absent from work for 1 or more days in any week.
    
    (2) An increase in the rate of disablement pension under subsection (1)---
        
    *   (a) applies only for the period of the treatment; and
    
    *   (b) must not result in the rate of the pension exceeding the rate that would be payable if the veteran were totally disabled.

    (2) If the veteran has been receiving weekly income compensation for less than 6 months and VANZ assesses the veteran as able to work full-time in employment in which he or she was employed immediately before receiving weekly income compensation, the veteran ceases to be entitled to weekly income compensation on the expiry of 10 days after receiving notice of the assessment.
    
    (3) If the veteran has been receiving weekly income compensation for 6 months or more and VANZ assesses the veteran as able to work full-time in employment in which he or she was employed immediately before receiving weekly income compensation, the veteran ceases to be entitled to weekly income compensation on the earlier of---

    *   (a) the date on which the veteran commences full-time employment; or
    
    *   (b) the expiry of 28 days after the assessment.
    
    

##### 63 Entitlement to compensation reduces if veteran able to work part-time
    
*   (1) This section applies to a veteran who is under the New Zealand superannuation qualification age and is receiving weekly income compensation.

    *   (a) first becomes entitled to weekly income compensation before reaching New Zealand superannuation qualification age; and
    
    *   (b) has been entitled to it for 24 months or longer before reaching that age.
    
    (2) Such a veteran loses his or her entitlement to weekly income compensation on reaching that age.

    (4) Such a veteran is entitled to weekly income compensation for 24 months from the date of entitlement to the compensation.
    
    (5) However, the veteran's entitlement to the compensation is dependent on his or her making an election to be entitled, after reaching New Zealand superannuation qualification age, to the compensation, rather than to New Zealand superannuation or a veteran's pension under [Part 6][204].
    
    (6) Subsections (7) and (8) apply to a veteran who first becomes entitled to weekly income compensation---
        
    *   (a) within 12 months before reaching New Zealand superannuation qualification age; or
    
    *   (b) on or after reaching New Zealand superannuation qualification age.
    
    (7) Such a veteran is entitled to the weekly income compensation for a period of 12 months following the later of---
        
    *   (a) the date of reaching New Zealand superannuation qualification age; or
    
    *   (b) the date of entitlement to weekly income compensation.
    
    (8) The veteran is then entitled to the weekly income compensation for the next 12 months, if he or she makes an election to be entitled, during those 12 months, to the compensation, rather than to New Zealand superannuation or the veteran's pension under [Part 6][204].
    
    (9) Nothing in this section entitles a veteran to weekly income compensation if he or she is not otherwise entitled to it under this Act.
    
    (10) A veteran must make an election under subsection (5) or (8) within the period that is the later of the following:
        
    *   (a) within 1 month before the date on which the election would take effect; or
    
    *   (b) within 1 month after the veteran has been notified of the amount of the weekly income compensation by VANZ, the review officer, or the appeal board, whichever is applicable in the veteran's case.
    
    (11) VANZ may allow a veteran to exercise or revoke an election under subsection (5) or (8) after the period specified in subsection (10) has ended, but only if VANZ is satisfied that the veteran's circumstances have changed significantly since the end of the period.

    (2) Subsection (1) does not apply if, immediately before the veteran's death,---

    *   (b) the claimant was not contributing to the veteran's day-to-day welfare.

    *   (a) the day after the veteran's death, if the application is received by VANZ within 6 months after the veteran's death; or

##### 103 Weekly compensation is income for purposes of Income Tax Act 2007
    
*   [Schedule 4][359] contains a consequential amendment to the Income Tax Act 2007 that makes payments of weekly compensation under this subpart income for the purposes of that Act.

##### 104 Relationship between weekly compensation and New Zealand superannuation or veteran's pension
    
*   (1) Subsection (2) applies to a veteran who---
        
    *   (a) first becomes entitled to weekly compensation before reaching the New Zealand superannuation qualification age; and
    
    *   (b) has been entitled to it for 24 months or longer before reaching that age.
    
    (2) Such a veteran loses his or her entitlement to weekly compensation on reaching that age.
    
    (3) Subsections (4) and (5) apply to a veteran who first becomes entitled to weekly compensation 12 months or more, but less than 24 months, before reaching New Zealand superannuation qualification age.
    
    (4) Such a veteran is entitled to weekly compensation for 24 months from the date of entitlement to the compensation.
    
    (5) However, the veteran's entitlement to the compensation is dependent on his or her making an election to be entitled, after reaching New Zealand superannuation qualification age, to the compensation, rather than to New Zealand superannuation or a veteran's pension under [Part 6][204].
    
    (6) Subsections (7) and (8) apply to a veteran who first becomes entitled to weekly compensation---
        
    *   (a) within 12 months before reaching New Zealand superannuation qualification age; or
    
    *   (b) on or after reaching New Zealand superannuation qualification age.
    
    (7) Such a veteran is entitled to the weekly compensation for a period of 12 months following the later of---
        
    *   (a) the date of reaching New Zealand superannuation qualification age; or
    
    *   (b) the date of entitlement to weekly compensation.
    
    (8) The veteran is then entitled to the weekly compensation for the next 12 months, if he or she makes an election to be entitled, during those 12 months, to the compensation, rather than to New Zealand superannuation or a veteran's pension under [Part 6][204].
    
    (9) Nothing in this section entitles a veteran to weekly compensation if he or she is not otherwise entitled to it under this Act.
    
    (10) A veteran must make an election under subsection (5) or (8) within the period that is the later of the following:
        
    *   (a) within 1 month before the date on which the election would take effect; or
    
    *   (b) within 1 month after the veteran has been notified of the amount of the weekly compensation by VANZ, the review officer, or the appeal board, whichever is applicable in the veteran's case.
    
    (11) VANZ may allow a veteran to exercise or revoke an election under subsection (5) or (8) after the period specified in subsection (10) has ended, but only if VANZ is satisfied that the veteran's circumstances have changed significantly since the end of the period.

    *   (b) liaise with ACC as to whether VANZ or ACC should prepare a rehabilitation plan, in the case of a veteran who is not claiming full entitlements under [Part 3][51] or [4][106]; and
    
    *   (c) if, under paragraph (b), it is decided that---

    *   (a) must---
            
        *   (i) determine whether the veteran is likely to need social or vocational rehabilitation after the 13 weeks have ended; and
        
        *   (ii) if so, prepare an individual rehabilitation plan in consultation with the veteran; and

    (3) VANZ is responsible for providing a key aspect of social rehabilitation to a veteran---
        
    *   (a) if the conditions in subsection (4) are met; but
    
    *   (b) not earlier than a date determined in accordance with [section 123][161].
    
    (4) The conditions are---
        
    *   (a) a veteran is assessed or reassessed under [section 124][162] as needing the key aspect; and
    
    *   (b) the provision of the key aspect is in accordance with VANZ's assessment of it under whichever of [clauses 8][385] to [16][388] of [Schedule 2][357] are relevant; and
    
    *   (c) VANZ considers that the key aspect---
            
        *   (i) is required as a direct consequence of the injury or illness for which the veteran has entitlements under [Part 3][51] or [4][106]; and
        
        *   (ii) is for the purpose set out in [section 120][158]; and
        
        *   (iii) is necessary and appropriate, and of the quality required, for that purpose; and

    (5) This section is subject to any regulations made under [section 267][337].

##### 122 VANZ may provide other social rehabilitation
    
*   (1) VANZ may provide any other social rehabilitation if---
        
    *   (a) it is required as a direct consequence of the injury or illness for which the veteran has entitlements under this Part; and
    
    *   (b) the veteran is assessed or reassessed under [section 124][162] as needing it; and

    *   (b) has decided to provide under [section 122][160].
    
    (2) VANZ is responsible for providing social rehabilitation on the later of---
        
    *   (a) the date on which the application for the social rehabilitation is made; or
    
    *   (b) if the need for the social rehabilitation is assessed to arise after the date of the application, the date when it is assessed to arise.
    
    (3) However, if VANZ considers that, in the veteran's circumstances, it would be unreasonable for the veteran to have made an earlier application, it may begin providing social rehabilitation to the veteran on and from another date that it considers reasonable.
    
    (4) Subsection (3) does not entitle a veteran to entitlements that the veteran would not have been entitled to had the application been made earlier.

##### 124 Assessment and reassessment of need for social rehabilitation
    
*   (1) An assessment under this section assesses a veteran's need for social rehabilitation and identifies the specific social rehabilitation that the veteran needs.

    *   (g) any social rehabilitation (not provided as vocational rehabilitation) that may reasonably be provided to enable a veteran who is entitled to vocational rehabilitation to participate in employment:
    
    *   (h) the geographical location in which a veteran lives:
    
    *   (i) in the case of a reassessment,---
            
        *   (i) whether any item that VANZ provided for the purposes of social rehabilitation is in such a condition as to need replacing:

    *   (b) obtain employment; or
    
    *   (c) regain or acquire vocational independence.
    
    (2) Without limiting subsection (1), the provision of vocational rehabilitation includes the provision of activities for the purpose of maintaining or obtaining employment that is---
        
    *   (a) suitable for the veteran; and
    
    *   (b) appropriate for the veteran's levels of training and experience.
    
    

##### 126 VANZ responsible for providing vocational rehabilitation
    
*   (1) VANZ is responsible for providing vocational rehabilitation to a veteran who---
        
    *   (a) has suffered an injury or illness for which he or she has entitlements under [Part 3][51] or [4][106]; and
    
    *   (b) is---
            
        *   (i) entitled to weekly income compensation or weekly compensation; or
        
        *   (ii) likely, unless he or she has vocational rehabilitation, to be entitled to weekly income compensation or weekly compensation; or
        
        *   (iii) on parental leave.
        
        
    
    (2) Despite subsection (1)(b)(i), VANZ is responsible for providing vocational rehabilitation to a person who was entitled to weekly compensation and who would, but for [section 104][136], continue to be entitled to weekly income compensation or weekly compensation.

##### 127 Matters to be considered in deciding whether to provide vocational rehabilitation
    
*   (1) In deciding whether to provide vocational rehabilitation, VANZ must have regard to the matters in [section 128][167].
    
    (2) In deciding what vocational rehabilitation is appropriate for the veteran to achieve the purpose of vocational rehabilitation under [section 125][164],---
        
    *   (a) VANZ must consider whether it is reasonably practicable to return the veteran to the same employment in which the veteran was engaged, and with the employer who was employing the veteran, when the veteran's incapacity commenced; and
    
    *   (b) if it is not, VANZ must consider the following matters:
            
        *   (i) whether it is reasonably practicable to return the veteran to an employment of a different kind with that employer:
        
        *   (ii) whether it is reasonably practicable to return the veteran to the employment in which the veteran was engaged when the veteran's incapacity commenced, but with a different employer:
        
        *   (iii) whether it is reasonably practicable to return the veteran to a different employment with a different employer, in which the veteran is able to use his or her experience, education, or training:
        
        *   (iv) whether it is reasonably practicable to help the veteran use as many of his or her pre-injury skills as possible to obtain employment.
        
        
    
    

##### 128 Further matters to be considered in deciding whether to provide vocational rehabilitation
    
*   (1) In deciding whether to provide vocational rehabilitation, VANZ must have regard to---
        
    *   (a) whether the vocational rehabilitation is likely to achieve its purpose under the veteran's individual rehabilitation plan; and
    
    *   (b) whether the vocational rehabilitation is likely to be cost-effective, having regard to the likelihood that costs of entitlements under this Act will be reduced as a result of the provision of vocational rehabilitation; and
    
    *   (c) whether the vocational rehabilitation is appropriate in the circumstances.
    
    (2) VANZ must provide the vocational rehabilitation for the minimum period necessary to achieve its purpose, but must not provide any vocational rehabilitation for longer than 3 years (which need not be consecutive).
    
    (3) However, VANZ may, at its discretion, provide vocational rehabilitation for longer than 3 years if VANZ considers that---
        
    *   (a) the vocational rehabilitation would be likely to achieve its purpose under the veteran's individual rehabilitation plan; and
    
    *   (b) the vocational rehabilitation would be likely to be cost-effective, having regard to the likelihood that costs of entitlements under this Act will be reduced as a result of the provision of vocational rehabilitation; and
    
    *   (c) the vocational rehabilitation would be appropriate in the circumstances.
    
    (4) Despite subsections (1)(b) and (3)(b), VANZ must not take into account as a factor against providing vocational rehabilitation that the veteran is, or may become, a person to whom [section 65][83] or [104][136] (relationship between weekly compensation and New Zealand superannuation) applies.
    
    (5) This section is subject to any regulations made under [section 267][337].

##### 129 Vocational rehabilitation may start or resume if circumstances change
    
*   (1) VANZ may, at any time, decide whether or not there has been a change of circumstances affecting the veteran's need for vocational rehabilitation.
    
    (2) If VANZ decides that there has been such a change, VANZ and the veteran may agree to the modification of the veteran's individual rehabilitation plan to reflect the changed circumstances.

    *   (a) the income tax return for the relevant year is available; or
    
    *   (b) 3 months have passed after the incapacity commenced.

    (2) However, if a veteran is receiving weekly compensation at the minimum rate payable under [clause 25][561], [37(3)][579], or 37(5), VANZ must reduce the amount of weekly compensation paid to the veteran to ensure that the total of the veteran's weekly compensation and earnings does not exceed the average wage.
