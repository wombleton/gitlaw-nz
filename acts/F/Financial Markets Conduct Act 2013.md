    ###### Example
    
    A and B enter into a futures contract.
    
    Both A and B are derivatives issuers. Accordingly, both A and B are issuers of the futures contract.
    
    Although both parties are issuers, whether any particular party has disclosure or other obligations will depend on the circumstances.
    
    If both A and B hold a market services licence, both A and B will be wholesale investors under [clause 37(1)(f)][815] of Schedule 1\. Accordingly, neither party will be required to make disclosure under [Part 3][48] to the other party.
    
    (5) In this Act, a reference to an issuer in relation to events, circumstances, or other matters before the financial products are issued is a reference to the person that will be, or is intended to be, the issuer when those products are issued.

        *   (i) the only investors who are able, under the terms of the offer, to acquire the products are investors to whom disclosure under this Part is not required; and
        
        *   (ii) all of the investors who acquire the products under the offer are investors to whom disclosure under this Part is not required.
        
        
    
    ###### Example
    
    ABC Limited makes an offer of its ordinary shares to 100 investors.
    
    Of those investors, 5 are wholesale investors, 15 are relatives of directors of ABC Limited, and 20 are close business associates of ABC Limited. Exclusions under Schedule 1 apply and accordingly the offers to these investors do not require disclosure under this Part.
    
    However, none of the exclusions in Schedule 1 apply to the remaining 60 investors. The offer to each of these investors requires disclosure. This means that a product disclosure statement must be given to each of the 60 investors under section 50 (subject to section 51).
    
    The offer of ABC Limited's ordinary shares, as a whole, is a regulated offer because at least some of the offers to investors require disclosure. 
    
    Some obligations under this Act apply to the regulated offer as a whole. These obligations apply to all of the investors even if the offers to some of those investors do not require disclosure. For example, all money paid for the shares must be held in trust under section 87 (even if the money is paid by a wholesale investor, a relative, or a close business associate), ongoing disclosure under subpart 4 may be required to be made to a wholesale investor, a relative, or a close business associate, and registers of financial products kept under subpart 4 of Part 4 relate to products held by all product holders.
    
    (2) In this Act, _regulated product_ means---
        
    *   (a) a financial product offered under a regulated offer; or
    
    *   (b) a managed investment product in a registered scheme (whether or not there has been a regulated offer).
    
    

##### 42 Regulated offers that need to meet additional governance requirements
    
*   (1) A regulated offer of debt securities must meet requirements under [subpart 1][135] of Part 4\.
    
    (2) A regulated offer of managed investment products must meet requirements under [subpart 2][161] of Part 4\.

##### 43 Options over financial products
    
*   (1) For the purposes of this Part and [Schedule 1][761],---
        
    *   (a) an offer of an option to acquire, by way of issue, a financial product is an offer both of the option and of the underlying financial product; and
    
    *   (b) the grant of an option without an offer of the option is an offer of the option; and
    
    *   (c) an offer to grant an option is an offer to issue the option.
    
    (2) _See_ [clause 11][837] of Schedule 1 for an exclusion in relation to options.
    
    Compare: Corporations Act 2001 s 702 (Aust)

##### 44 Treatment of offers of convertible financial products
    
*   For the purposes of this Part and [Schedule 1][761], an offer of a financial product that will be converted, or is or may become convertible, into another financial product is an offer both of the financial product that is issued and of the financial product into which it converts.

##### 45 Treatment of offers of renewals and variations
    
*   (1) For the purposes of this Part and [Schedule 1][761], an offer of a renewal or variation of the terms or conditions of a financial product made by the issuer is an offer of the financial product as renewed or varied.
    
    (2) A change to the terms or conditions of a financial product is not a variation for the purposes of this section if the change is made in accordance with the existing terms or conditions of the financial product (for example, if the issuer exercises a power under the terms or conditions to change an interest rate).
    
    (3) _See_ [clause 24][838] of Schedule 1 for an exclusion in relation to renewals and variations (but limited disclosure may be required under [clause 26][778] of that schedule).

##### 46 Offers of financial products involving customised terms
    
*   (1) Offers of a type of financial product to 2 or more investors are not prevented from being part of the same regulated offer merely because the product involves terms that are customised for each investor.
    
    (2) The PDS and register entry for a regulated offer are not required to include specific information about any customised terms that apply to a particular investor.
    
    (3) Subsection (2) does not prevent the regulations from requiring a PDS or register entry to contain information about the kinds of terms that may be customised for each investor.
    
    ###### Example
    
    A derivatives issuer makes an offer of a particular type of swap agreement to retail investors (where the offer to at least 1 of those investors requires disclosure under this Part).
    
    These derivatives involve some standard or generic terms. They also involve customised terms that are negotiated with each retail investor (for example, terms relating to particular dates or amounts).
    
    The offer of those derivatives to those investors is a regulated offer.
    
    The PDS or register entry relates to the regulated offer as a whole. The PDS and register entry do not include specific information about the customised terms that apply to a particular investor. This does not prevent the regulations requiring the PDS or register entry to contain a description of the kinds of customised terms that may be negotiated (such as a range of dates or amounts).

##### 47 Territorial scope of Part
    
*   (1) This Part applies to offers of financial products in New Zealand, regardless of---
        
    *   (a) where any resulting issue or transfer occurs:
    
    *   (b) where the issuer or offeror is resident, incorporated, or carries on business.
    
    (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), financial products are offered in New Zealand if an offer of the financial products is received by a person in New Zealand, unless the offeror demonstrates that it has taken all reasonable steps to ensure that persons in New Zealand (other than persons referred to in subsection (3)) may not accept the offer.
    
    (3) The persons referred to in this subsection are persons to whom disclosure under this Part is not required because of an exclusion under any of [clauses 3 to 5][805] of Schedule 1\.

        *   (ii) the form was copied, or directly derived, by the person making the application from a form referred to in subparagraph (i).
        
        
    
    (2) The identification of the PDS under subsection (1)(b) must be reasonably prominent.

##### 53 Offence to knowingly or recklessly contravene section 50

    *   (b) in the case of a derivative, withdraw from the derivative.
    
    (2) The right referred to in subsection (1) is exercisable by A giving to the offeror notice of the exercise of the right within the earlier of---

##### 57 Disclosure of material information and content of PDS and register entry
    
*   (1) An issuer that prepares, or is required to prepare, a PDS must ensure that, as at the date on which the PDS is lodged with the Registrar,---
        
    *   (a) the PDS---
            
        *   (i) contains all of the information that it is required to contain by the regulations; and
        
        *   (ii) is accompanied by all of the documents that the regulations require it to be accompanied by; and
        
        *   (iii) complies with all other requirements of the regulations relating to the content of the PDS; and

        *   (v) if applicable, specifies its expiry date (_see_ [section 84][105]) and states that no financial products will be issued or sold on the basis of the PDS in relation to applications received after the expiry date; and
        
        *   (vi) complies with [section 60][75] (consent for expert statements or endorsements); and
        
        
    
    *   (b) the register entry (if any)---
            
        *   (i) contains all of the information that it is required to contain by the regulations; and
        
        *   (ii) contains all material information relating to the regulated offer that is not contained in the PDS; and
        
        *   (iii) complies with all other requirements of the regulations relating to the content of the register entry; and
        
        *   (iv) complies with [section 60][75] (consent for expert statements or endorsements).
        
        
    
    (2) Subsection (1)(b)(ii) does not limit subsection (1)(a).
    
    (3) Subsection (1)(b)(ii) does not apply in the prescribed circumstances (which may include, for example, certain offers to existing product holders or certain situations in which information about an offer is available by means of a continuous disclosure obligation).

##### 58 Register entry not required in prescribed circumstances
    
*   A register entry for a regulated offer is not required in the prescribed circumstances.

##### 59 Meaning of material information in this Part
    
*   (1) In this Part, _material information_, in relation to a regulated offer, means information that---
        
    *   (a) a reasonable person would expect to, or to be likely to, influence persons who commonly invest in financial products in deciding whether to acquire the financial products on offer; and
    
    *   (b) relates to the particular financial products on offer or the particular issuer, rather than to financial products generally or issuers generally.
    
    (2) However, **material information** does not include---
        
    *   (a) information about the specific terms of a financial product that have been customised for a particular investor; or
    
    *   (b) information about an identifiable investor.
    
    ###### Example
    
    A derivatives issuer makes an offer of a particular type of swap agreement to retail investors.
    
    These derivatives involve some standard or generic terms. They also involve customised terms that are negotiated with the particular retail investor (for example, terms relating to particular dates or amounts).
    
    The material information for the regulated offer as a whole does not include specific information about the customised terms that apply to a particular investor. This does not prevent the regulations requiring the PDS or register entry to contain a description of the kinds of customised terms that may be negotiated.
    
    Compare: Corporations Act 2001 ss 674, 677, 710, 1013E (Aust)

    *   (a) A has consented in writing to the statement being included in the PDS or register entry in the form and context in which it is included; and
    
    *   (b) the PDS or register entry states that A has given the consent; and
    
    *   (c) A has not withdrawn the consent before the PDS is lodged with the Registrar.

    (3) In this section and [section 83(3)][103],---
    
    _approved rating agency_ means a rating agency nominated or approved under [section 80][839] of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1989 or [section 62][840] of the Insurance (Prudential Supervision) Act 2010

    *   (a) may reasonably be regarded as encouraging or persuading persons to acquire the financial products on offer; and

    _expert_---
        
    *   (a) means a person who holds himself or herself out to be of a profession or calling that gives authority to a statement made by him or her; but

##### 64 Registrar must notify FMA of lodgement of PDS
    
*   (1) The Registrar must, immediately after a PDS is lodged, notify the FMA of the lodgement for the purpose of allowing the FMA an opportunity to consider the PDS, any governing document, and whether the offer, or intended offer, of financial products will be made in compliance with this Act.
    
    (2) The nature and extent of the consideration under subsection (1) (if any) is at the FMA's discretion.

    (3) The FMA must give a copy of the notice under subsection (1) to the Registrar.

##### 67 Waiting period restriction does not prevent offeror from acting under another PDS
    
*   If [section 65][81] applies to a PDS that relates to a particular offer of financial products but another lodged PDS that is not or is no longer subject to section 65 also relates to the offer of those products, that section does not prevent an offeror, in accordance with this Act, from accepting applications for, or issuing or transferring, financial products in reliance upon the other PDS.

*   (1) This section applies if the FMA is satisfied that---
        
    *   (a) its consideration as referred to in [section 64][80] is complete; or
    
    *   (b) consideration as referred to in [section 64][80] is, in the circumstances, unnecessary.
    
    (2) The FMA may give notice to the offeror that---

    (2) The FMA may issue a notice that prescribes the class or classes of continuous issue PDSs to which [section 65][81] applies.
    
    (3) The FMA must, before issuing a notice in respect of a class of continuous issue PDSs, be satisfied that it is in the public interest for the FMA to have an opportunity to consider those PDSs before any person accepts applications for, or issues or transfers, financial products offered under those PDSs (for example, where in the circumstances, a particular risk relates to a particular class of offerors or financial products).
    
    (4) [Subpart 5][727] of Part 9 (general provisions relating to certain FMA instruments) applies to a notice under this section.

        *   (i) complies with this Act and the regulations:
        
        *   (ii) does not contain any material misdescription or material error or any material matter that is not clearly legible:
        
        *   (iii) is not false or misleading:
        
        
    
    *   (b) the FMA has considered a PDS, register entry, or governing document with a view to determining whether it---
            
        *   (i) complies with this Act and the regulations:
        
        *   (ii) contains any material misdescription or material error or any material matter that is not clearly legible:

    (2) The civil liability provisions to which subsection (1) applies are---

##### 491 Guidance for court on how to determine gains made or losses avoided for purposes of maximum amount
    
*   (1) For the purposes of [section 490(1)(b)][625], a person must be treated as---
        
    *   (a) making a gain if the person acquires a financial product for less than its value:
    
    *   (b) avoiding a loss if the person disposes of a financial product for more than its value.
    
    (2) In this case, the gain made or loss avoided is the difference between the consideration paid or received (as the case may be) and the value the financial product would have had at the time of the issue or sale if,---
        
    *   (a) in the case of a contravention of any of [sections 241 to 243][310], the material information had been generally available to the market; or
    
    *   (b) in the case of a contravention of [section 262][334] or [265][337], the conduct, statement, or information had not been misleading, deceptive, or false; or
    
    *   (c) in any other case, the contravention had not occurred.
    
    (3) This section does not---
        
    *   (a) limit the circumstances in which the court may find that a person has made a gain or avoided a loss; or
    
    *   (b) prevent the court from finding that the amount of the gain made, or the loss avoided, by a person exceeds an amount calculated under this section.
    
    Compare: 1988 No 234 [s 42X][1136]

##### 492 Considerations for court in determining pecuniary penalty

    (3) A statement under subsection (2) may be in respect of an offer or a class of offers.

### Subpart 3---FMA's designation power

##### 562 FMA's designation power
    
*   (1) The FMA may---
        
    *   (a) declare that a security that would not otherwise be a financial product is a financial product of a particular kind:
    
    *   (b) declare that a financial product is, or is to become, a financial product of a particular kind (whether or not it was previously a financial product of a different kind):
        
        ###### Example
        
        A share is normally an equity security.
        
        However, a particular type of share may have terms that mean that, in substance, the share is similar to a debt security.
        
        The FMA may declare that a share of that kind is a debt security.
    
    *   (c) declare that a security that would otherwise be a financial product of a particular kind is not a financial product:
    
    *   (d) declare that an offer of financial products that would not otherwise require disclosure under [Part 3][48] because of an exclusion under [Part 1][833] of Schedule 1 does require disclosure under [Part 3][48]:
        
        ###### Example
        
        A small offer is generally excluded from requiring disclosure (_see_ clause 12 of Schedule 1).
        
        However, an offer of a particular kind may involve significant risks for investors that may otherwise be undisclosed to investors.
        
        The FMA may declare that disclosure under Part 3 is required despite the exclusion (and, accordingly, the offer is a regulated offer).
    
    *   (e) declare that an offer of financial products for sale that would not otherwise require disclosure under [Part 3][48] does require disclosure under Part 3 (_see_ [section 563(1)(c)][719]):
        
        ###### Example
        
        Offers of financial products for sale generally require disclosure only in limited circumstances (_see_ Part 2 of Schedule 1).
        
        However, an issuer could structure an offer with a view to circumventing, evading, or defeating the disclosure provisions of this Act.
        
        The FMA may declare that disclosure of the offer under Part 3 is required despite the fact that the provisions in Part 2 of Schedule 1 do not apply.
    
    *   (f) declare, in relation to a managed investment product or if a declaration is made under paragraph (a) or (b) declaring that a security or financial product is a managed investment product, that a scheme is, or is to become, a managed investment scheme in relation to that managed investment product:
    
    *   (g) if a declaration is made under paragraph (a), (b), or (f), declare that a person or type of person is, or is to become, the issuer or offeror of the relevant financial products:
    
    *   (h) declare a person, service, or conduct to be not exempt under any exemption that would otherwise apply under section 389(2) (and accordingly the licensing requirement under this Act applies):
    
    *   (i) declare a person, service, or conduct to be not exempt under any exemption or exclusion that would otherwise apply under section 238(1)(a) to (h) (in relation to either [subpart 5][346] or [6][373] of Part 5), or under [section 285][361], [287][363], or [309][389].
    
    (2) A declaration may specify terms and conditions relating to---
        
    *   (a) the circumstances in which the declaration applies, including (without limitation) by reference to any person or class of persons or any transaction or class of transactions:
    
    *   (b) transitional matters.
    
    (3) Nothing in this section prevents the FMA from granting an exemption under [subpart 2][710] that applies to an offer, a financial product, or any other matter that is the subject of a declaration under this section.
    
    ###### Example
    
    The FMA declares that a particular type of share (which would otherwise be an equity security) is a debt security.
    
    However, some of the regulatory requirements that relate to debt securities are inappropriate in respect of these shares.
    
    Accordingly, the FMA grants an exemption (on terms and conditions) from those requirements in order to customise the regulatory requirements that will apply.
    
    (4) The provisions of this Act apply subject to a declaration under this subpart.
    
    (5) [Subpart 5][727] (general provisions relating to certain FMA instruments) applies to a declaration under this section.

##### 563 Procedural requirements

    *   (a) it is satisfied that the declaration is necessary or desirable in order to promote either or both of the main purposes of this Act specified in [section 3][4] or any of the additional purposes specified in [section 4][5]; and
    
    *   (b) in the case of [section 562(1)(a) to (d)][718], it has had regard to the economic substance of the relevant security; and
    
    *   (c) in the case of [section 562(1)(e)][718], it is satisfied that the offer or class of offers has, or would have, a purpose or an effect of circumventing, evading, or defeating any of the purposes referred to in paragraph (a) (having regard to the economic substance of the offer or offers); and
    
    *   (d) it has consulted the persons or representatives of the persons that the FMA considers will be substantially affected by the declaration.
    
    (2) A failure to comply with subsection (1)(d) does not affect the validity of the declaration.

##### 564 Transitional matters
    
*   A declaration under this subpart---
        
    *   (a) does not apply to financial products issued or transferred before the commencement of the declaration; and
    
    *   (b) applies subject to any terms and conditions of the declaration relating to transitional matters.

        *   (ii) an offeror or service provider to provide a copy of the order to all or any of those associated persons.
        
        
    
    (3) For the purpose of subsection (2), the order is not required to refer to the associated persons by name.
    
    (4) The FMA---

    *   (b) a later date specified by the FMA by notice to the offeror or service provider to which the order relates.
    
    (2) For the purposes of subsection (1)(b),---
        
    *   (a) the FMA may specify a later date if the FMA is of the opinion that it is not reasonably practicable for it to complete its consideration as referred to in [section 565(1)(a)][721] within the 15-working-day period referred to in subsection (1)(a):
    
    *   (b) the later date must be a date that is no more than 30 working days after the day on which the interim order is made.

## Part 1  
Transitional provisions on enactment of this Act for offers of financial products

##### 4 Act applies to offer unless former enactments continue to apply
    
*   (1) This Act applies to an offer of financial products unless the former enactments apply in accordance with this Part.
    
    (2) In this Part,---
    
    _1978 Act_ means the [Securities Act 1978][1396]
    
    _12-month date_ means the date that is 12 months after the commencement of this clause
    
    _2-year date_ means the date that is 2 years after the commencement of this clause
    
    _continuous issue securities_ means debt securities or managed investment products that are of a kind that were, before the commencement of this clause, continuously offered by a continuous issuer to the public for subscription
    
    _continuous issuer_ means an issuer that in the ordinary course of its business before the commencement of this clause continuously offered debt securities or managed investment products to the public for subscription
    
    _former enactments_ means each of the following:
        
    *   (a) the [1978 Act][1396] (as in force immediately before the commencement of this clause):
    
    *   (b) the [Securities Regulations 2009][1397] and any other regulations made under the [1978 Act][1396] (as in force immediately before the commencement of this clause):
    
    *   (c) exemptions granted under the [1978 Act][1396] (to the extent that those exemptions apply to the relevant offer of securities)---
            
        *   (i) as in force immediately before the commencement of this clause (but subject to any variation or revocation under clause 11); or
        
        *   (ii) as in force after being granted by the FMA under [clause 11][1328].
        
        
    
    (3) In this Part, _issuer_, _prospectus_, _registered prospectus_, and _securities_ have the same meanings as in the [1978 Act][1396].
    
    (4) In this Part, a reference to an offer of securities to the public has the same meaning as in [section 3][1398] of the 1978 Act.

##### 5 Former enactments continue to apply if prospectus registered before commencement
    
*   If securities are offered in a prospectus that is registered under the [1978 Act][1396] before the commencement of this clause, the former enactments continue to apply to the offer and allotment of those securities under that prospectus as if this Act had not been enacted.

##### 6 Issuer may elect to comply with former enactments instead of this Act if prospectus registered within 12 months or 2 years of commencement
    
*   (1) Despite the repeal of the [1978 Act][1396], an issuer of securities may register a prospectus in respect of the securities in accordance with the former enactments on or before---
        
    *   (a) the 2-year date in the case of continuous issue securities; or
    
    *   (b) the 12-month date in any other case.
    
    (2) If securities are offered in a prospectus that is registered under subclause (1) and the issuer makes an election under subclause (3), the former enactments apply, as if this Act had not been enacted, to the offer and allotment of those securities under that prospectus.
    
    (3) For the purposes of subclause (2), an issuer may elect for the former enactments to apply to an offer of securities by including a statement in the prospectus to the effect that the [Securities Act 1978][1396] applies to the offer.
    
    (4) The statement referred to in subclause (3) may include additional information about an applicable exemption granted under the [1978 Act][1396] that is necessary to ensure that the statement is not misleading.

##### 7 Former enactments apply if no prospectus required unless issuer elects otherwise
    
*   (1) If, under the [1978 Act][1396] or an exemption granted under that Act, no registered prospectus is required for an offer of securities to the public in New Zealand, the former enactments apply, as if this Act had not been enacted, to any offer and allotment of those securities that is made before the close of the 2-year date unless the issuer makes an election, under subclause (3), for this Act to apply.
    
    (2) However,---
        
    *   (a) subclause (1) does not permit an offer to be made in reliance upon [section 5(2CB) or (2CBA)][847] of the 1978 Act:
    
    *   (b) subclause (1) does not apply in the prescribed circumstances.
    
    (3) For the purposes of subclause (1), an issuer may elect for this Act to apply to an offer of securities made after a particular date by---
        
    *   (a) giving to the FMA, before that date, a notice to the effect that this Act applies to the offer of the securities made after that date; and
    
    *   (b) including a copy of that notice on an Internet site maintained by, or on behalf of, the issuer at all reasonable times during the period between that date and the earlier of the close of the offer or the close of the 2-year date.
    
    

##### 8 This Act and 1978 Act are (on transitional basis) alternative means of compliance
    
*   If, in accordance with this Part,---
        
    *   (a) this Act applies to an offer of securities, the former enactments do not apply to the offer:
    
    *   (b) the former enactments apply to an offer of securities, this Act does not apply to the offer.
    
    

##### 9 All offers and allotments under old law must cease after scheme registered
    
*   Despite [clauses 4 to 8][1322], no offer or allotment of managed investment products may be made under the former enactments after the date on which the managed investment scheme to which the products relate becomes a registered scheme (or is treated as being a registered scheme under [Part 2][1332] of this schedule).

##### 10 All offers and allotments under old law must cease within 2 years of commencement
    
*   Despite [clauses 4 to 8][1322], no offer or allotment of securities may be made under the former enactments after the 2-year date (and this Act applies to all offers and acquisitions of financial products made after that date).

##### 11 FMA may continue to perform and exercise functions, duties, and powers
    
*   If the former enactments continue to apply to an offer of securities, the FMA may continue to perform and exercise all of its functions, duties, and powers conferred or imposed on it by or under the former enactments as if this Act had not been enacted (for example, it may grant, vary, or revoke an exemption under [section 70B][1399] of the 1978 Act).

##### 12 Part does not prevent PDS from being lodged
    
*   Nothing in this Part prevents an issuer from lodging a PDS in preparation for making an offer of financial products under [Part 3][48] of this Act.

##### 13 Part 2 applies even if former enactments apply to offer
    
*   (1) Despite [clause 8][1325], [Part 2][22] of this Act (and any other provision of this Act relating to the enforcement, application, or effect of that Part) applies to an offer of securities to which the former enactments apply.
    
    (2) However, conduct that contravenes, or leads to liability under, [sections 55A to 57][1400] (in respect of an untrue statement) or [58][1401] of the 1978 Act does not contravene sections 19 to 23 of this Act.
    
    (3) For the purpose of this section, conduct must be treated as contravening, or leading to liability under, [sections 55A to 57][1400] or [58][1401] of the 1978 Act even if the conduct does not constitute an offence, or does not lead to any liability, because of the availability of a defence.

##### 14 Unsubstantiated representations prohibitions do not apply to prospectuses and investment statements
    
*   (1) [Section 23][30] and the provision of the [Fair Trading Act 1986][1402] that corresponds to section 23 do not apply to a representation made in a registered prospectus or an investment statement (within the meaning of the [1978 Act][1396]).
    
    (2) Subclause (1) applies despite [clause 13(1)][1330].

    (2) However, this Part does not apply to a security if, before the commencement of this clause, the security was cancelled, redeemed, or forfeited, or all of the obligations owing under the security had been discharged.

*   (1) If a former enactment would apply (but for its repeal, revocation, or amendment by this Act) to a security to which this Part applies (or to any scheme to which the security relates), that enactment continues to apply during the transition period in accordance with regulations made under [section 547][701] (if any).
    
    (2) _See_ [section 547][701], under which regulations may provide for former enactments to continue to apply (or to apply with modifications or additions), or for provisions of this Act or the [Financial Markets (Repeals and Amendments) Act 2013][765] to apply with modifications or additions, as set out in the regulations.
    
    (3) Despite subclauses (1) and (2), the provisions of the [KiwiSaver Act 2006][789] amended by [sections 101][1405], [105][1406], and [107][1407] of the Financial Markets (Repeals and Amendments) Act 2013 apply as amended to an interest in a KiwiSaver scheme to which this Part applies and to that KiwiSaver scheme.

*   (1) If a security to which this Part applies is---

    (2) This clause does not limit [clause 17][1336].

##### 19 Transition period
    
*   (1) In this Part, the _transition period_ for a particular security is the period beginning on the date on which this clause comes into force and ending on the close of the day before the earlier of the following dates:
        
    *   (a) the date that the issuer of the security elects; or
    
    *   (b) the date that is 2 years after the commencement of this clause.
    
    (2) If the issuer elects an effective date that is earlier than 2 years after the commencement of this clause, the issuer must notify the FMA and the Registrar of the elected date at least 20 working days before that date.

#### Transitional provisions on and after effective date

##### 20 Ongoing requirements of this Act apply on and after effective date
    
*   (1) On and after the effective date for a particular security to which this Part applies, the following apply to the security (and, in the case of a managed investment product, to the managed investment scheme to which it relates):

    *   (e) any other provision of this Act relating to the enforcement, application, or effect of [subpart 4][119] of Part 3, [Part 4][133], or [Part 7][564] of this Act.
    
    (2) The provisions referred to in subclause (1) apply with all necessary modifications as if the security had been offered and allotted under a regulated offer under this Act.
    
    (3) However, subclause (1) and [clauses 21][1117], [22][880], and [30][1347] (obligations relating to registration of a scheme under this Act) do not apply to a security if,---
        
    *   (a) before the effective date, the security is cancelled, redeemed, or forfeited, or all of the obligations owing under the security have been discharged; or
    
    *   (b) on the effective date, the security is not a financial product within the meaning of [section 7][10] (but _see_ [clause 33][1350]); or
    
    *   (c) under the [1978 Act][1396], the security was a debt security but, as a result of [section 5(2C) or (3)][847] of that Act, [section 33(2)][854] of that Act did not apply to the security; or
    
    *   (d) under the [1978 Act][1396], the security was a participatory security but, as a result of [section 5(3)][847] of that Act, [section 33(3)][854] of that Act did not apply to the security.
    
    

##### 21 Issuer of debt security must lodge trust deed and supply information

    *   (b) supply to the Registrar and the FMA, before the effective date,---
            
        *   (i) the names and addresses of the persons who, on the effective date, will be the issuer and the licensed supervisor; and
        
        *   (ii) all other prescribed information relating to the debt security.
        
        
    
    (2) _See_ [subpart 3][616] of Part 8 of this Act, which provides for civil liability for a contravention of subclause (1).

    *   (a) the managed investment scheme to which the product relates (the **scheme**) must, on and after the effective date, be treated as being a registered scheme; and
    
    *   (b) the issuer must ensure that a copy of the governing document for the scheme that complies with [sections 135 to 137][176] is lodged with the Registrar before the effective date; and
    
    *   (c) the issuer must supply to the Registrar and the FMA, before the effective date,---
            
        *   (i) the name and address of the person who, on the effective date, will be the manager; and
        
        *   (ii) the name and address of the person who, on the effective date, will be the licensed supervisor (unless the scheme is a restricted scheme); and
        
        *   (iii) all other prescribed information relating to the managed investment product and the scheme.
        
        
    
    (2) _See_ [subpart 3][616] of Part 8 of this Act, which provides for civil liability for a contravention of subclause (1)(b) or (c).
    
    (3) Nothing in this clause or [clause 23][1341] prevents the FMA from---
        
    *   (a) directing that the registration of a scheme to which this clause applies be cancelled under [section 195][247]; or
    
    *   (b) exercising any other power in respect of such a scheme.
    
    

##### 23 Type of registration
    
*   (1) A managed investment scheme that is treated as being registered under [clause 22][880] must be treated as being registered on the register of managed investment schemes as the 1 or more of the following types of scheme that apply to it:
        
    *   (a) a KiwiSaver scheme if, immediately before the effective date, the scheme was registered as a KiwiSaver scheme in the KiwiSaver schemes register:
    
    *   (b) a KiwiSaver scheme that is a restricted scheme if paragraph (a) applies and, immediately before the effective date, the scheme was identified as a restricted scheme on the KiwiSaver schemes register:
    
    *   (c) a superannuation scheme if, immediately before the effective date, the scheme was registered under the [Superannuation Schemes Act 1989][1403] (unless paragraph (f) applies):
    
    *   (d) a superannuation scheme that is a restricted scheme if paragraph (c) applies and an Order in Council has designated the scheme as a restricted scheme under subclause (2):
    
    *   (e) a superannuation scheme that is a legacy scheme if paragraph (c) applies and an Order in Council has designated the scheme as a legacy scheme under subclause (2):

    *   (h) a restricted scheme that is an employer-related scheme if paragraph (b), (d), or (g) applies and an Order in Council under subclause (2) has designated the scheme as an employer-related scheme:
    
    *   (i) a complying superannuation fund if paragraph (c) applies and, immediately before the effective date, the scheme was approved as a complying superannuation fund under section 35 of the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989\.
    
    (2) The Governor-General may, by Order in Council, on the advice of the Minister given in accordance with a recommendation of the FMA,---
        
    *   (a) designate a scheme as a restricted scheme for the purposes of subclause (1)(d) or (g):
    
    *   (b) designate a scheme as a legacy scheme for the purposes of subclause (1)(e):
    
    *   (c) designate a scheme as a workplace savings scheme for the purposes of subclause (1)(f):
    
    *   (d) designate any scheme that will be a restricted scheme under this section as being an employer-related scheme for the purposes of [section 172][219].
    
    (3) A scheme may be designated under subclause (2)(b) or (c) as a type of scheme in respect of a section of the scheme only and, in that case, subclause (1) treats the scheme as being on the register of managed investment schemes as that type in respect of that section of the scheme.
    
    (4) [Section 131(1)(c)][171] (which prevents certain changes without the FMA's consent to the conditions of entry of scheme participants) applies to a restricted scheme on and after the date on which a designation by Order in Council comes into force under subclause (2) in all cases as if that date of designation were the date of the scheme's registration under this Part. 

##### 24 Registrar to amend register
    
*   (1) The Registrar must, on or as soon as practicable after the effective date for a managed investment scheme to which [clause 22(1)(a)][880] applies, amend the register of managed investment schemes to include an entry relating to the scheme.
    
    (2) The Registrar is not required to act under subclause (1) before [clause 22(1)(b) and (c)][880] have been complied with.

##### 25 Restriction on making regulated offers and accepting contributions if requirements have not been complied with
    
*   (1) This clause applies if an issuer contravenes [clause 22(1)(b) or (c)][880] in respect of a managed investment scheme that is treated as being a registered scheme under clause 22(1)(a).
    
    (2) The issuer must not, on and after the effective date, make a regulated offer of a managed investment product, or accept further contributions, in respect of that managed investment scheme.
    
    (3) Subclause (2) ceases to apply if---
        
    *   (a) the issuer lodges with the Registrar a copy of the governing document for the scheme that complies with [sections 135 to 137][176]; and
    
    *   (b) the issuer supplies to the Registrar and the FMA the prescribed information; and
    
    *   (c) the register of managed investment schemes includes an entry relating to the scheme.
    
    (4) _See_ [subpart 3][616] of Part 8 of this Act, which provides for civil liability for a contravention of this clause.

##### 26 Issuer may amend or replace governing document with FMA's consent
    
*   (1) This clause applies---
        
    *   (a) to a governing document that, immediately before the commencement of this clause, relates to a debt security or constitutes or governs a scheme; and
    
    *   (b) despite anything to the contrary in the governing document or in any enactment, rule of law, or agreement, including anything relating to the consent of any person to the making of amendments to the governing document.
    
    (2) The issuer of the debt security or the manager of the scheme (as the case may be) may amend or replace the governing document with the FMA's consent if the FMA is satisfied that---
        
    *   (a) the amendment or replacement is necessary or desirable to ensure, or in connection with ensuring, that the governing document complies with the requirements of this Act; or
    
    *   (b) (for any amendments or differences in the replaced governing document to which paragraph (a) does not apply) the procedures of the existing governing document for amendments have been complied with.
    
    (3) An amendment or a replacement made under this clause must be treated for all purposes as if it were made in accordance with the governing document.
    
    (4) On the amendment or replacement under this clause of a governing document that constitutes or governs a scheme,---
        
    *   (a) the scheme must be treated as the same scheme as it was immediately before the amendment or replacement of the existing governing document; and
    
    *   (b) the persons who were members of the scheme immediately before the amendment or replacement of the existing governing document continue to be members of the same scheme; and
    
    *   (c) the assets or liabilities of a scheme or fund must be treated as if they vested in the scheme or fund immediately after the amendment or replacement of the existing governing document, but for the purposes of the Inland Revenue Acts this must be treated as if it is not a transfer (as defined in [section YA 1][775] of the Income Tax Act 2007).
    
    (5) In this clause and [clauses 27][1344] and [28][1345], _scheme_ has the same meaning as in [section 2(1)][814] of the 1978 Act (as in force immediately before the commencement of this clause).
    
    (6) To avoid doubt, this clause does not limit the ways in which a governing document may be amended or replaced in accordance with its terms or any enactment or rule of law.
    
    (7) The FMA's discretion to set preconditions for requests to it includes (without limitation) a discretion to set preconditions that satisfy the FMA that it is appropriate for the amendment or replacement to be done under this section rather than by means of another power or process.

##### 27 Conversion of governing documents to separate governing documents
    
*   (1) This clause applies---
        
    *   (a) to a governing document (**existing governing document**) that, immediately before the commencement of this clause, constitutes or governs 2 or more schemes, sections of schemes, or funds; and
    
    *   (b) despite anything to the contrary in the governing document or in any enactment, rule of law, or agreement, including anything relating to the consent of any person to the making of amendments to the governing document.
    
    (2) The parties to an existing governing document may rescind the existing governing document, provided that the existing governing document is immediately replaced with a new governing document in respect of each scheme, section, or fund constituted or governed by the existing governing document.
    
    (3) However,--- 
        
    *   (a) an existing governing document must not be rescinded, and new governing documents must not be executed, under this clause without the prior written consent of the FMA; and 
    
    *   (b) the parties to, and provisions of, a new governing document must differ from the parties to, and provisions of, the existing governing document only to the extent that---
            
        *   (i) it is necessary or desirable to ensure, or in connection with ensuring, that the new governing document complies with this Act; or
        
        *   (ii) (for any differences to which subparagraph (i) does not apply) the procedures of the existing governing document for amendments have been complied with in relation to those differences.
        
        
    
    (4) On the replacement of an existing governing document with new governing documents under this clause,---
        
    *   (a) the 2 or more schemes, sections, or funds are governed by separate governing documents rather than by the existing governing document; and
    
    *   (b) a scheme, section, or fund must be treated as the same scheme, section, or fund as it was immediately before the replacement of the existing governing document; and
    
    *   (c) the persons who were members of a scheme, section, or fund immediately before the replacement of the existing governing document continue to be members of the same scheme, section, or fund; and 
    
    *   (d) no assets or liabilities are removed from any of the schemes, sections, or funds; and
    
    *   (e) the 2 or more schemes must be treated as separate persons for the purposes of the Inland Revenue Acts; and
    
    *   (f) no new settlement (as defined in [section YA 1][775] of the Income Tax Act 2007) occurs.
    
    (5) This clause expires, and is repealed, 2 years after the commencement of this clause.
    
    (6) To avoid doubt, this clause does not limit the ways in which a scheme, section, or fund may be divided into separate schemes in accordance with the terms of the governing document or any enactment or rule of law.
    
    (7) The FMA's discretion to set preconditions for requests to it includes (without limitation) a discretion to set preconditions that satisfy the FMA that it is appropriate for the division of the scheme, section, or fund to be done under this section rather than by means of another power or process.

*   (1) This clause applies---
        
    *   (a) to 2 or more governing documents (**existing governing documents**) that, immediately before the commencement of this clause, constitute or govern 2 or more schemes or funds (**existing separate schemes**); and
    
    *   (b) despite anything to the contrary in the existing governing documents or in any enactment, rule of law, or agreement, including anything relating to the consent of any person to the making of amendments to the existing governing documents.
    
    (2) The parties to the existing governing documents may rescind the existing governing documents, provided that the existing governing documents are immediately replaced with 1 new governing document and 1 scheme or fund (**amalgamated scheme**) in respect of all of the existing separate schemes constituted or governed by the existing governing documents.
    
    (3) However,--- 
        
    *   (a) existing governing documents must not be rescinded, and a new governing document must not be executed, under this clause without the prior written consent of the FMA; and 
    
    *   (b) the parties to, and provisions of, a new governing document must differ from the parties to, and provisions of, the existing governing documents only to the extent that---
            
        *   (i) it is necessary or desirable to ensure, or in connection with ensuring, that the new governing document complies with this Act; or
        
        *   (ii) (for any differences to which subparagraph (i) does not apply) the procedures of the existing governing documents for amendments have been complied with in relation to those differences.
        
        
    
    (4) On the replacement of the existing governing documents with 1 new governing document and the amalgamated scheme under this clause,---
        
    *   (a) the amalgamated scheme is governed by 1 governing document rather than each existing separate scheme being governed by separate governing documents; and
    
    *   (b) the amalgamated scheme must be treated as the same scheme as the existing separate schemes combined for all purposes (other than as specified in paragraphs (d) to (f)); and
    
    *   (c) the persons who were members of each existing separate scheme immediately before the replacement of the existing governing documents are members of the amalgamated scheme; and 
    
    *   (d) the amalgamated scheme must be treated as the same person as the existing separate schemes combined for the purposes of the Inland Revenue Acts other than---
            
        *   (i) for the purposes of the PIE rules (as defined in [section YA 1][775] of the Income Tax Act 2007); and
        
        *   (ii) as specified in paragraph (f)); and
        
        
    
    *   (e) the assets or liabilities of the existing separate schemes must be treated as if they vested in the amalgamated scheme immediately after the replacement of the existing governing documents, but for the purposes of the Inland Revenue Acts this must be treated as if it is not a transfer (as defined in [section YA 1][775] of the Income Tax Act 2007); and 
    
    *   (f) [subparts IA][1409] and [IQ][1410] of Part I of the Income Tax Act 2007 (which relate to the treatment of tax losses) do not apply to any carry forward of a loss balance of an existing separate scheme to the amalgamated scheme for the income year in which an existing governing document is replaced or for any later income year. 
    
    (5) This clause expires, and is repealed, 2 years after the commencement of this clause.
    
    (6) To avoid doubt, this clause does not limit the ways in which schemes or funds may be amalgamated in accordance with the terms of their governing documents or any enactment or rule of law.

    (3) To the extent that the following enactments would otherwise apply to an interest to which this clause applies, those enactments continue to apply as if this Act had not been enacted:

*   (1) If, immediately before the commencement of this clause, an instrument of appointment is in effect under [section 177][1432] of the KiwiSaver Act 2006, the instrument continues in effect as if it had been made under [section 132][1433] of that Act (and, accordingly, an appointment under the instrument continues subject to the terms and conditions of the appointment).
    
    (2) If a default KiwiSaver scheme that is the subject of an instrument of appointment referred to in subclause (1) has not yet been reregistered under [clause 22(1)(a)][880], the grounds for revocation of the instrument of appointment under [section 137(2)][1434] of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 include the grounds in [section 184(2)][1435] of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 (as in force on the date on which this Act receives the Royal assent).
