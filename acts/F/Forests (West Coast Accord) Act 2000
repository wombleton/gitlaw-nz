    Settlement Act 1998).
    
    
    (2) An easement
    granted under subsection (1) is enforceable in accordance with its
    terms despite [Part 3B][43] of the Conservation Act 1987, [section 59A][44] of the Reserves Act 1977, and [section 49][45] of the National Parks Act 1980\.

*   
    
    
    
    (1) Land that
    has its status changed by a declaration under [section 8(1)][10] continues to be
    subject to an existing encumbrance that relates to that land until
    the existing encumbrance expires, or is terminated or cancelled, if---
    
    *   (a) the existing encumbrance was in force
        on 15 May 2000 or negotiations for the existing encumbrance were
        entered into on or before that date; and
        
    
    
    
    *   (b) the existing encumbrance is still in
        force immediately before the declaration takes effect.
        
        
    
    
    
    
    (2) The terms
    of an existing encumbrance saved by subsection (1) are enforceable

    (1) [Section 14][16] applies only to
    the terms of the existing encumbrance as at 15 May 2000 or the
    date on which the existing encumbrance first came into force (whichever
    is later), and to any variation of those terms---
    
    *   (a) that is of a minor and technical nature;
        or
        
    
    
    
    *   (b) that does not materially increase the
        adverse effects of the activity authorised by the existing encumbrance
        on that date or materially increase the duration of that activity
        or materially change the location of that activity; or
        
        
    
    
    
    *   (c) that will result in a reduction of the
        adverse effects or the duration of that activity; or
        
        
    
    
    
    *   (d) negotiations for which were entered into
        on or before 15 May 2000\.
        
    
    
    
    
    (2) [Section 14][16] continues to apply
    to---
    
    *   (a) an existing encumbrance that is renewed
        for a further term under a right of renewal conferred by the existing
        encumbrance:
        
    
    
    
    *   (b) an existing encumbrance that is transferred
        to another person.
        
    
    
    
    
    



##### 16 Time limit on saving of existing encumbrances

    by a declaration under [section 8(1)][10],---
    
    *   (a) [section 14][16] ceases to apply
        to an existing encumbrance that is in force for an unspecified period
        in relation to that land; and
        
    
    
    
    *   (b) that existing encumbrance is cancelled.
        
        
    
    
    
    
    (2) To avoid doubt,
    if an existing encumbrance is granted in perpetuity, it is not in
    force for an unspecified period.
    
    
    (3) This section
    does not apply to existing encumbrances granted by an enactment or
    by the exercise of a power contained in an enactment.
    
    
    



##### 17 Powers under existing encumbrances to be exercised
by new Minister
    
*   
    
    
    
    If, before a
    declaration under [section 8(1)][10] takes effect, an
    existing encumbrance conferred a power on a responsible Minister or
    on any person appointed by the Crown to manage the land,---
    
    *   (a) the power may be exercised by the new
        Minister after the declaration takes effect; and
        
        
    
    
    
    *   (b) the new Minister may take all necessary
        proceedings to enforce the existing encumbrance, or relating to breaches

##### 18 Exemptions if existing encumbrances exchanged for
concessions
    
*   
    
    
    
    (1) The purpose
    of this section is to provide exemptions from the concession regime
    under the [Conservation Act 1987][29] for conservation
    areas, reserves, or national parks, so as to enable a person to exchange
    an existing encumbrance saved by [section 14][16] for a concession
    during the life of the existing encumbrance.
    
    
    (2) If a person

        Act (Minister not to grant application contrary to Act or purposes
        for which land held) do not apply:
        
    
    
    
    *   (c) [section 17W][48] of the Conservation Act 1987 (relationship between concessions and conservation management strategies
        and plans) does not apply:
        
    
    
    
    *   (d) [section 17T(2)][46] of the Conservation Act 1987 (Minister to decline application within 20 working days) does not
        apply to the extent that it requires the Minister of Conservation
        to decline an application for non-compliance or inconsistency with
        provisions of that Act that are excluded by this subsection or with
        a conservation management strategy or conservation management plan:
        
        
    
    
    
    *   (e) [Part 3B][43] of the Conservation Act 1987 is subject to the modifications in this subsection for the purposes
        of that Act and also [section 59A][44] of the Reserves Act 1977, [section 49][45] of the National Parks Act 1980, and any other enactment.

    is granted by the Minister of Conservation in exchange for the existing
    encumbrance, the existing encumbrance is cancelled.

    (1) The exemptions
    in [section 18][20] apply only---
    
    *   (a) if the application for the concession
        is made before the existing encumbrance expires or is terminated or
        cancelled; and
        
    
    
    
    *   (b) to the extent that the activity to be
        authorised by the concession is an activity already authorised by
        the existing encumbrance saved by [section 14][16].
        
        
    
    
    
    
    (2) [Section 18][20] does not apply to---

##### Notes


###### 1 General
    
*   
    
    
    This is a reprint of the Forests (West Coast Accord) Act
    2000\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at
    21 October 2000, as specified in the list of amendments at the
    end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that have
    yet to come into force or that contain relevant transitional or savings
    provisions are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological
    order.
    



###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   
    
    
    Under [section 16D][51] of the Acts and Regulations Publication
    Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date
    of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by
    the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though
    editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations
    Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official
    volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal
    enactment and its amendments are contained.
    



###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   
    
    
    A number of editorial conventions are followed in the
    preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included
    in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted.
    For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/
    or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts
    and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in
    Force_.
    



###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations
Publication Act 1989
    
*   
    
    
    [Section
    17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act
    1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set
    out in [sections
    17D][52] and [17E][53] of that Act so that, to the
    extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment
    is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes
    that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January
    2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since
    1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation
    reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation
    and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under
    the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication
    Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant,
    in the preparation of this reprint:
    
        
    *   
        
        •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   
        
        •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
        
    *   
        
        •layout of provisions, including:
        
            
        *   
            
            •indentation
        *   
            
            •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear
            above the section)
            
        
        
        
    *   
        
        •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type,
        without quotation marks)
    *   
        
        •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   
        
        •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page
        of each Act)
    *   
        
        •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
        
    *   
        
        •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals,
        and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   
        
        •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
        
            
        *   
            
            •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared
            with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are
            amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word
            (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
            
        *   
            
            •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now
            capital letters
            
        
        
        
    *   
        
        •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule),
        and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   
        
        •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
        
    *   
        
        •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules
        of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather
        than chronological).
