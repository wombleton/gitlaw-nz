*   #### Preamble
    
    (1) The Farmers' Mutual Insurance Association (the _FMIA_) was formed from the merger of a number of associations incorporated under the [Mutual Insurance Act 1955][54] (the _1955 Act_). Those associations were incorporated to provide fire and other insurance to their members, being principally farmers and persons that service or support farmers:
    
    (2) The FMIA is now the only association incorporated under the 1955 Act:
    
    (3) The FMIA can operate only within the limited powers and authorities conferred upon it by the 1955 Act, and must comply with the governance requirements specified in the 1955 Act. Those powers, authorities, and requirements are outdated and inappropriate, and restrict the FMIA's ability to compete with others in its industry and to provide relevant products and services:
    
    (4) The FMIA wishes to preserve its mutual status, but modernise its powers and authorities. At the same time, the FMIA wishes to maintain its current principal business and to grant membership rights to policyholders insuring risks to rural property. Accordingly, this Act removes the FMIA from the jurisdiction of the 1955 Act, renames it the Farmers' Mutual Group, and incorporates it as a mutual association under this Act with the powers, capacity, and governance regime of a company under the [Companies Act 1993][55]:
    
    (5) The objects of this Act cannot be achieved without the authority of Parliament.

##### 1 Title
    
*   This Act is the Farmers' Mutual Group Act 2007\.

##### 2 Commencement
    
*   (1) [Section 1][2], this section, and [Part 1][4] come into force on the day after the date on which this Act receives the Royal assent.
    
    (2) The rest of the Act comes into force on a date or dates to be appointed by the Governor-General by Order in Council; and 1 or more Orders in Council may be made appointing different dates for different provisions and for different purposes.
    
    (3) An Order in Council must not be made under subsection (2) unless the members of the Farmers' Mutual Insurance Association have adopted a constitution as the initial constitution of the Mutual in accordance with [section 4][6].
    
    Section 2(2): Part 2 and Schedule brought into force, on 1 April 2008, by the [Farmers' Mutual Group Act 2007 Commencement Order 2008][56] (SR 2008/12).
