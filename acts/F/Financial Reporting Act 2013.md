##### 45 Meaning of large

    ###### Example

During the period 1 April 2013 to 31 March 2014, that total revenue was $35 million. Given that the $30 million threshold in paragraph (b) is crossed in only 1 of those preceding periods, paragraph (b) is not satisfied. 
    
    ABC Limited is not a large company in relation to the accounting period of 1 April 2014 to 31 March 2015\.

    (3) Despite subsections (1) and (2), an entity is not large in respect of an accounting period if it was an inactive entity in respect of that period.
    
    (4) In subsection (3), an entity is an _inactive entity_ in respect of an accounting period if,---
        
    *   (a) during that period, the entity---
            
        *   (i) has not derived, or been deemed to have derived, any income; and
        
        *   (ii) has no expenses; and
        
        *   (iii) has not disposed of, or been deemed to have disposed of, any assets; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) at the end of that period, the entity has no subsidiaries or all of its subsidiaries are inactive entities in respect of that period.
    
    (5) In determining whether an entity is an inactive entity, no account may be taken of any---
        
    *   (a) statutory company filing fees or associated accounting or other costs; or
    
    *   (b) bank charges or other minimal administration costs totalling not more than $50 in the accounting period; or
    
    *   (c) interest earned on any bank account during the accounting period, to the extent that the total interest does not exceed the total of any charges or costs incurred by the entity to which paragraph (b) applies.
    
    

##### 46 Meaning of specified not-for-profit entity

##### 48 Minister must regularly review amounts to take into account inflation
    
*   (1) The Minister---
        
    *   (a) must review the monetary amounts specified in [sections 45][59] and [46][60] of this Act, [section 204(3)][130] of the Companies Act 1993, and [section 64(2)][131] of the Friendly Societies and Credit Unions Act 1982 for the purpose of determining whether or not to recommend that an adjustment be made to those amounts in order to take into account any increase in the CPI during the period to which the review relates; and
    
    *   (b) may, after conducting a review, make a recommendation for the purposes of [section 49][63].

### Subpart 3---Transitional provisions

##### 55 Financial Reporting Act 1993 continues to apply to issuers
    
*   (1) This section---
        
    *   (a) applies to---
            
        *   (i) every person who, immediately before the commencement of this section, was an issuer within the meaning of [sections 4 to 6][140] of the Financial Reporting Act 1993; and
        
        *   (ii) every person who, after the commencement of this section, makes an offer of securities under the [Securities Act 1978][141] (whether under [Part 1][142] of Schedule 4 of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 or otherwise) and who, if the [Financial Reporting Act 1993][128] had not been repealed, would have been an issuer under [section 4(1)(a) to (b)][140] of that Act; and
        
        *   (iii) every person who, after the commencement of this section, becomes a person referred to in [section 4(1)(ba)][140] of the Financial Reporting Act 1993 as a result of an offer referred to in subparagraph (ii); and
        
        *   (iv) every person who, after the commencement of this section, becomes a person referred to in [section 4(1)(c)][140] of the Financial Reporting Act 1993; but
        
        
    
    *   (b) does not apply to either of the following:
            
        *   (i) an operator referred to in [section 4(1)(e)][140] of the Financial Reporting Act 1993 (unless the operator would otherwise be an issuer under that section):
        
        *   (ii) any other person of a prescribed class.
        
        
    
    (2) The directors of a person to whom this section applies (_A_) must, in respect of A, continue to comply with the [Financial Reporting Act 1993][140] as if that Act had not been repealed by this Act (and as if A continued to be an issuer) in relation to every accounting period of A.
    
    ###### Example
    
    ABC Limited is an issuer under section 4(1)(a) of the Financial Reporting Act 1993 by virtue of an offer of securities to the public.
    
    The directors of ABC Limited must continue to prepare and register financial statements and group financial statements for ABC Limited and to have those statements audited in accordance with the Financial Reporting Act 1993\. The duty ceases in respect of accounting periods that commence on or after a prescribed date. After the prescribed date, the company may have financial reporting duties under the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 or the Companies Act 1993\. In addition, the duty under this section will not apply if ABC Limited is required to prepare financial statements under Part 7 of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013\.
    
    (3) Subsection (2) ceases to apply to accounting periods that commence on or after a date to be prescribed by, or determined in accordance with, regulations made for the purposes of this subsection.
    
    (4) The [Financial Reporting Act 1993][128] (including [sections 36 to 42][143], which relate to offences) and the [Financial Reporting (Fees and Forms) Regulations 2007][138] continue to apply for the purposes of subsection (2) as if they had not been repealed or revoked by this Act.
    
    (5) Despite subsections (1) to (4), nothing in the [Financial Reporting Act 1993][128] applies to an FMC reporting entity in relation to an accounting period if financial statements or group financial statements of the FMC reporting entity are required to be prepared for that period under [Part 7][144] of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013\.
    
    (6) Despite subsections (1) to (4), if, after this section comes into force, a person to whom this section applies ceases to be an issuer within the meaning of [sections 4 to 6][140] of the Financial Reporting Act 1993 (applied as if that Act were still in force),---
        
    *   (a) [section 5][145] of that Act applies; and
    
    *   (b) subsection (2) does not apply to a subsequent accounting period after the accounting period referred to in [section 5][145] of that Act (unless the person becomes an issuer again as referred to in subsection (1)(a)(ii) to (iv)).
    
    (7) _See_ [clause 20][146] of Schedule 4 of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 (which provides for [Part 7][144] of that Act to apply on and after an effective date for a security).
    
    (8) This section is repealed on the close of the date that is 5 years after the date on which this section comes into force.

##### 56 Former law for FMC reporting entities generally continues to apply to accounting periods that commence before commencement of section
    
*   (1) This section applies to an entity if---
        
    *   (a) any of the relevant transitional provisions or [section 55(1)][73] (or both) applies to the entity in relation to an accounting period that commenced before the commencement of this section (the _current period_); and
    
    *   (b) the entity becomes an FMC reporting entity at any time during the current period.
    
    (2) The relevant transitional provision or [section 55(1) to (4)][73] (or both) applies to the entity in relation to the current period (and, accordingly, [Part 7][144] of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 does not apply in relation to the current period).
    
    (3) However, if the entity is an FMC reporting entity during the current period under [section 451(a), (f), or (k)][93] of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 (or as a result of [clause 20(2A)][146] of Schedule 4 of that Act), [Part 7][144] of that Act applies to the entity in relation to the current period (rather than the relevant transitional provision or [section 55(1) to (4)][73]).
    
    (4) In this section, _relevant transitional provision_ means any of [sections 17(2)][147], [44(2)][148], [86(2)][149], [87(2)][150], [103(2)][151], [108(2)][152], [111(2)][153], and [117(2)][154] of the Financial Reporting (Amendments to Other Enactments) Act 2013\.
    
    ###### Example
    
    XYZ Credit Union has a financial year of 1 January to 31 December. It is an issuer under the Financial Reporting Act 1993\.
    
    If this section comes into force on 1 April 2014, the 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2014 financial year is its current period under this section. In addition, XYZ Credit Union becomes an FMC reporting entity on 1 April 2014 under section 451(i) of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 (the _FMC Act_).
    
    Under the transitional provision section 87(2) of the Financial Reporting (Amendments to Other Enactments) Act 2013, the Friendly Societies and Credit Unions Act 1982 (as in force before commencement) continues to apply to the current period. Under the former section 121(2)(c) of that Act (and section 55 of this Act), financial statements must be prepared in accordance with the Financial Reporting Act 1993\. These requirements apply to the current period (rather than Part 7 of the FMC Act) even though XYZ Credit Union became an FMC reporting entity on 1 April 2014\.
    
    However, if XYZ Credit Union makes a regulated offer under the FMC Act on (say) 1 December 2014, it will also be an FMC reporting entity under section 451(a) of the FMC Act. This means that Part 7 of that Act will apply to the current period rather than the requirements of the law in force before commencement.

##### 57 FMC reporting entity that is issuer or trustee of scheme that is not yet registered
    
*   (1) This section applies if---
        
    *   (a) an entity is an FMC reporting entity and is required to prepare financial statements under [Part 7][144] of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 in relation to an accounting period (the _relevant period_); and
    
    *   (b) the entity is an issuer or a trustee of a scheme referred to in [section 9A(1) or (2)][155] of the Financial Reporting Act 1993; and
    
    *   (c) the scheme is not a registered scheme within the meaning of [section 6(1)][156] of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013\.
    
    (2) Section 461A of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 (which requires financial statements for schemes and funds) applies in relation to the scheme and the relevant period as if it were a registered scheme.
    
    (3) Subsection (2) ceases to apply on the effective date (as defined in [clause 16][157] of Schedule 4 of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013) of a security in the scheme.

##### 58 Financial reporting standards and auditing and assurance standards continue in effect
    
*   Every financial reporting standard or auditing and assurance standard approved or issued under the [Financial Reporting Act 1993][128] that is in effect immediately before the commencement of this section---
        
    *   (a) continues in effect as a financial reporting standard or an auditing and assurance standard (as the case may be) as if issued under [section 12][15]; and
    
    *   (b) may be amended or revoked under [section 12][15].
    
    

##### 59 External Reporting Board may exercise power before commencement
    
*   (1) The External Reporting Board (as continued under [section 22][97] of the Financial Reporting Act 1993) may, before the commencement of [subparts 1][13] and [2][18] of Part 2, exercise a power under those subparts to issue a financial reporting standard, an authoritative notice, or an auditing and assurance standard.
    
    (2) Subsection (1) applies as if [subparts 1][13] and [2][18] of Part 2 were in force when the power is exercised.
    
    (3) This section does not limit [section 11][158] of the Interpretation Act 1999\.

##### 60 Definitions of large and specified not-for-profit entity may take into account accounting periods that commence before commencement of section
    
*   In [subpart 5][159] of Part 2, a reference to preceding accounting periods may include an accounting period regardless of whether it commenced before, on, or after the commencement of this section.

##### 61 Approvals for auditors continue in effect
    
*   An approval in effect, immediately before the commencement of this section, under [section 199(1)(c) or (d)][160] of the Companies Act 1993---
        
    *   (a) continues in effect as if given under [section 36(1)(c) or (d)][47] of this Act (as the case may be); and
    
    *   (b) may be revoked by the Registrar of Companies by notice in the _Gazette_.
