*   #### Preamble
    
    *   (1) Fiordland is a unique area that contains both exceptional marine biodiversity and valuable marine resources. Many marine species are found only in Fiordland, and some species (such as black and red corals) that are usually found only in very deep water occur in relatively shallow water in Fiordland. The fiords have become national icons and annually attract large numbers of tourists. The fiords and outer coast also support important commercial and recreational fisheries, notably rock lobster and blue cod.
    
    *   (2) In 1995, a group of stakeholders in the Fiordland marine environment formed the Guardians of Fiordland's Fisheries Inc, usually known as the Guardians of Fiordland's Fisheries and Marine Environment (the **Guardians of Fiordland**). Its membership now includes commercial and recreational fishers, environmentalists, charter boat and tourism operators, scientists, and tangata whenua (Ngāi Tahu). The formation of the Guardians of Fiordland was a response to their concerns regarding the escalating pressures on the Fiordland area resulting from increasing human use, the need for improved and integrated management of the area, and a desire that the community be more involved in the management of Fiordland's marine environment.
    
    *   (3) At their first meeting, the Guardians of Fiordland adopted the following vision:
        
        ""That the quality of Fiordland's marine environment and fisheries, including the wider fishery experience, be maintained or improved for future generations to use and enjoy.""
    
    *   (4) This vision guided the Guardians of Fiordland in developing its Fiordland Marine Conservation Strategy (the _Strategy_), which was published as a draft in October 2002\. The production of the Strategy involved publishing information, prioritising issues, and consulting the public and stakeholders (including local and central government management agencies).
    
    *   (5) A major success for the Guardians of Fiordland was in their gaining stakeholders' agreement to proposals for the integrated management of the Fiordland marine environment. Generally, this involved each stakeholder group relinquishing benefits in the interests of ensuring the quality and sustainable management of the Fiordland marine environment and fisheries. The Guardians of Fiordland referred to this process as the ""gifts and gains"". One notable proposal by the Guardians of Fiordland was for the protection of small, discrete areas containing items of special significance. These areas have become known as ""china shops"".
    
    *   (6) In September 2003, the Guardians of Fiordland presented their finalised Strategy to the Minister of Fisheries and the Minister for the Environment. On that occasion, the Ministers made a commitment to implement the Strategy by September 2005\. Subsequently, the Government appointed an Investigative Group (comprising representatives of central and regional government and the Guardians of Fiordland) to report on how best to implement the Strategy. In September 2004, the Government accepted the recommendations in the Investigative Group's report, and agreed to develop special legislation to give effect to many of those recommendations. The Government also agreed to amend fisheries regulations for non-commercial harvesting, to exclude commercial fishing from large areas of the internal waters of Fiordland, and to implement a range of other non-legislative measures.
    
    *   (7) The Strategy provided a framework for the future management of the Fiordland marine environment. The Government's commitment to implementing the Strategy recognises this fact and also acknowledges the local community's wealth of knowledge of the Fiordland area. The spirit of goodwill and co-operation that exists among stakeholders will underpin the collaborative approach proposed for the future management of the area. To ensure community input into that management, a new body (that is distinct from the Guardians of Fiordland) is established by this Act. The new body is to be known as the Fiordland Marine Guardians (the **Guardians**).

The values of the internal waters of Fiordland are outstanding. In 2003 the Guardians of Fiordland's Fisheries and Marine Environment completed a strategy document ("'the Fiordland Marine Conservation Strategy'") that proposed the protection of representative areas within Fiordland by creating 8 new marine reserves. This recommendation was implemented through the Fiordland (Te Moana o Atawhenua) Marine Management Act 2005\.
> 
> "The Fiordland Marine Conservation Strategy also identified "'China Shops'"---these are described as "'small discrete areas that are outstanding for the abundance and/or diversity of animal communities ... mixed animal and plant communities or ... particular animal species'". Of the 23 China Shops, 10 are now within the boundaries of marine reserves."

> 
> Sutherland Sound (454 ha):
> 
> Bligh Sound (411 ha):

> "A further marine reserve has also been declared in Paterson Inlet, Rakiura/Stewart Island area, namely Ulva Island---Te Wharawhara (1 075 ha). This marine reserve was _Gazetted_ on 18 November 2004\.
> 
> "Eight of the Fiordland Marine Reserves were established as a result of the work of the Guardians of Fiordland's Fisheries and Marine Environment. This group comprises Ngāi Tahu, commercial and recreational fishing representatives, charter and tourism operators, and community interests, all of whom have a direct involvement in the Fiordland marine environment. The group has been supported by the Southland Regional Council, the Ministry for the Environment, the Department of Conservation, and the Ministry of Fisheries."

##### Policy 4.1.4

Insert as policy 4.1.4:

> "**Policy 4.1.4****Management of Resource Management Act functions in marine reserves and in China Shops within the Fiordland (Te Moana o Atawhenua) Marine Area**
> 
> "Ensure that in considering applications, under the Resource Management Act 1991, for activities within marine reserves and within China Shops in the Fiordland (Te Moana o Atawhenua) Marine Area, the activities are compatible with the values and purposes of these areas.
> 
> "**Explanation**---The purposes and functions of Marine Reserves are established under the Marine Reserves Act 1971\. The Resource Management Act 1991 controls activities in the coastal marine area including the erection and placement of structures, commercial surface water activities, and aircraft landings and take-offs, and applies to areas that have marine reserve status, as well as the China Shops identified in the Fiordland Marine Conservation Strategy.
> 
> "The Fiordland Marine Conservation Strategy was produced by the Guardians of Fiordland's Fisheries and Marine Environment in June 2003, and describes China Shops as follows:
> 
> China Shops are small discrete areas that are outstanding for the abundance and/or diversity of animal or mixed animal and plant communities or for the abundance of particular animal species. Communities associated with a wide variety of habitats in a confined area may also qualify. On the basis of local knowledge and the best available information, 23 areas were identified from Bligh Sound to Preservation Inlet. Collectively, these areas support a wide range of special features and values. Proposed management measures are based on particular values and whether these are under threat from existing or future activities.
> 
> "China Shops that are not within marine reserves are recognised in Appendix 3A, which identifies the general location of these China Shops, but not the specific location. Any person undertaking an activity within these areas can contact either the Southland Regional Council or the Fiordland Marine Guardians to determine whether or not their activity is likely to have an impact on the China Shop in the vicinity. Each China Shop has its own values and potential threats to these values will vary.
> 
> "The purpose of the Marine Reserves Act 1971, as well as the threats to marine reserves, will be taken into account when processing and considering whether or not to grant a coastal permit for an activity within a marine reserve. The values and potential threats to China Shops will be taken into account when processing and considering whether or not to grant a coastal permit for an activity within a China Shop.
> 
> "Communication with the Fiordland Marine Guardians and the Department of Conservation will be essential in achieving this part of the policy."

#### **Section 7.3---Discharges**

##### Section 7.3.8.2

Omit paragraph 1 and substitute:

> "The cleaning and repainting of structures and ships on land and within the coastal marine area can result in discharges to coastal water, antifoulants in particular, which lead to discolouration, deposition, and adverse effects on aquatic life. Structures, equipment, and ships that have been in coastal waters where invasive organisms are present pose a potential risk to the Southland coastal marine environment if these organisms, or viable parts of these organisms, have become attached to these structures, equipment, or the hulls of ships and then consequentially arrive in Southland without having been cleaned or disinfected before entering Southland's waters. Invasive organisms attached to these structures, equipment, or the hulls of ships can be discharged into the marine environment either accidentally, through spawning or being knocked off, or deliberately, through cleaning. To the extent that it is practicable, both deliberate and accidental discharges, including discharges from the cleaning and repainting of structures and ships on land and within the coastal marine area, should be avoided."

##### Issue 7.3.8.2.2

Insert, after issue 7.3.8.2.1:

"**Issue 7.3.8.2.2****The unique habitats of the internal waters of Fiordland are particularly susceptible to invasive species that may arrive as hull attachments or on equipment or structures brought into these waters from other areas.**"

##### Objective 7.3.8.2.2

Insert, after objective 7.3.8.2.1:

"**Objective 7.3.8.2.2****Minimise risk of bioinvasion**

> "Minimise the risk from hull cleaning, structure cleaning, and the introduction of invasive organisms from ships, structures, and equipment from outside this region.
> 
> "**Explanation**---Ships, equipment, and structures that have been in coastal waters outside the Southland region have the potential to introduce invasive organisms into the Southland coastal marine area, if they are not appropriately cleaned before entering Southland waters. Of particular concern is the protection of sensitive and unique areas such as the internal waters of Fiordland. Where there is a known risk, for example, if a ship or structure is relocating to the Fiordland area from an area where there are known invasive organisms such as _Undaria_, measures should be taken to minimise that risk."

##### Policy 7.3.8.2.3

Insert, after policy 7.3.8.2.2:

"**Policy 7.3.8.2.3****Hull cleaning of ships in the coastal marine area**

> "Provide for hull cleaning of ships in circumstances where materials containing bioaccumulative, toxic, or noxious substances, or viable unwanted or pest organisms, do not enter or are not released into the coastal marine area.
> 
> "**Explanation**---Boats are periodically cleaned to remove marine growths from their hulls, or other maintenance work is undertaken that has similar effects to those that occur during hull cleaning. Where this is undertaken with appropriate controls the effect is insignificant. However, where there is the potential to discharge bioaccumulative, toxic, and noxious substances and growths of unwanted or pest marine organisms, this can have significant adverse effects, particularly where unwanted and pest organisms become established in Southland waters.
> 
> "If a ship has operated inside the territorial waters of a foreign country or has spent time in New Zealand ports where unwanted or pest organisms are established, and has not subsequently cleaned its hull, potential exists for these organisms to be attached to the hull of the ship. This is particularly true if the ship has spent time in shallow coastal waters such as in ports or bays and coves. The waters of the Southland coastal marine area are relatively free of these types of organisms and it is important that this status is maintained, if the highly significant areas of Fiordland, Rakiura/Stewart Island and the sub-Antarctic islands are to be protected from infestation.
> 
> "**Policy 7.3.8.2.4****Cleaning of ships, structures, and equipment destined for the internal waters of Fiordland**
> 
> "Require that any ships to be used in commercial surface water activities, in Fiordland, and any structures or equipment that are to be erected or placed within the internal waters of Fiordland that have been in coastal waters in other parts of New Zealand or in foreign waters, be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected before entering, or being placed in, Fiordland's internal waters.
> 
> "**Explanation**---Through hull cleaning or through the presence of organisms on ships, structures, or equipment that enter or are placed in coastal waters, a potentially invasive organism could be introduced to Fiordland's internal waters.
> 
> "Fiordland is a globally unique environment. It has high value marine resources and biodiversity, including species found only in this part of the world. Many habitats are found at unusually shallow depths because of the influence of the freshwater layer in the fiords. The internal waters of Fiordland are particularly sensitive to the introduction of unwanted or pest organisms. It is appropriate to reduce the risk of the introduction of a potentially invasive organism being introduced to Fiordland, by thoroughly cleaning and disinfecting all ships that are to be used in commercial surface water activities and any structures and equipment that are to be erected or placed within the internal waters of Fiordland. This should be done before the ships, structures, or equipment that have been in coastal waters in other parts of New Zealand or in foreign waters enter, or are placed in, Fiordland's internal waters."

> 
> "**Explanation**---Fiordland contains amenity and natural character values that are very high due to the pristine nature of the area. It would be inappropriate to allow the erection of structures that are incompatible with the character of this area. The sensitive communities and habitats of marine reserves and China Shops may be particularly affected."

> 
> "**Explanation**---Anchoring and mooring are not necessarily incompatible with protecting China Shops. However, in China Shops the adverse effects of anchoring or mooring (such as the disturbance of the seabed and destruction of marine communities) have the potential to be significant. Where activities pose a threat to these values, the areas should be identified and specific controls put in place to prevent damage."

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Fiordland (Te Moana o Atawhenua) Marine Management Act 2005\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 21 April 2005, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that have yet to come into force or that contain relevant transitional or savings provisions are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order.

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][81] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/legislation/reprints.shtml or Part 8 of the _Tables of Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations, and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][82] and [17E][83] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
