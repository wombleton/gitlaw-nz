##### 6 Financial institutions to verify identity of facility holders
    
*   (1) Subject to subsections (3) and (4), where any request is made to a financial institution for a person to become a facility holder (whether in relation to an existing facility provided by that financial institution or by means of the establishment, by that financial institution, of a new facility), that financial institution shall verify the identity of that person.
    
    (2) Where subsection (1) applies in respect of any request for a person to become a facility holder in relation to a facility, the financial institution shall verify the identity of that person---
        
    *   (a) before that person becomes a facility holder in relation to that facility; or
    
    *   (b) as soon as practicable after that person becomes a facility holder in relation to that facility, in any case where---
            
        *   (i) that person belongs to a class of persons with whom the financial institution does not normally have face to face dealings; and
        
        *   (ii) it is impracticable to undertake the verification before the person becomes a facility holder.
        
        
    
    (3) Notwithstanding anything in subsection (1), in any case where, in relation to a facility provided by a financial institution, there are 3 or more facility holders, it shall not be necessary for that financial institution to have verified the identity of every such facility holder, as long as the financial institution has verified the identity of every person who is, for the time being, a principal facility holder.
    
    (4) Notwithstanding anything in subsection (1), nothing in that subsection requires a trustee or administration manager or investment manager of a superannuation scheme to verify the identity of any person---

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Financial Transactions Reporting Act 1996\. It incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 July 2013, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][151] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][152] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][153] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][154] and [17E][155] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
