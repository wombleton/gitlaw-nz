    provided that no such agreement shall be entered into with the lessee of any land without the prior consent in writing of the owner of the land.
    
    (2) Every such forestry encouragement agreement shall specify the following particulars:
        
    *   (a) the land to which the agreement relates and the area that has been or is to be planted in trees:
    
    *   (b) the species of trees planted or to be planted:
    
    *   (c) the silvicultural treatment of the trees planted or to be planted:
    
    *   (d) the amount to be advanced by the Minister:
    
    *   (e) such other conditions as the Minister may require.
    
    (3) Every forestry encouragement agreement shall include a covenant by the owner or occupier of the land binding himself and his successors in title to perform and observe the terms and conditions upon which the advance is made.
    
    (4) A forestry encouragement agreement may provide for any sum repayable to be diminished in proportion to the extent to which the agreement has been performed or observed.
    
    (5) Where the owner or occupier of any land has entered into a forestry encouragement agreement, that agreement may be registered against the title of that owner or occupier to the whole or any part of the land to which the agreement relates but no such agreement shall be so registered unless notice thereof has been given to every mortgagee and other person having a charge on any estate or interest in the land at the date of registration. Registration of a forestry encouragement agreement may be effected by depositing with the Registrar a duplicate of the agreement, certified under the hand of the Conservator, together with an application for the registration of the agreement, which application shall be signed by the Conservator and shall specify the land against which it is desired to register the agreement, and shall certify that the agreement is one that may be registered against the land under this section and that notice of the agreement has been given to the persons specified in the certificate (being every mortgagee and other person having a charge on any estate or interest in the land at the date of registration). On receipt of the duplicate agreement and application as aforesaid, the Registrar shall, without fee, enter a memorial of the agreement upon the register against the title to the land of the owner or occupier who is a party to the agreement specified in the application. In any such case it shall not be necessary for the Registrar to record the like memorial on the duplicate certificate of title or lease. The memorial may sufficiently describe the agreement as a forestry encouragement agreement under the Forestry Encouragement Act 1962\.
    
    (6) Where any notice has to be given under this section, it may be given---
        
    *   (a) by delivering it to the person to whom it has to be given; or
    
    *   (b) by leaving it at the usual or last known place of abode in New Zealand of that person; or
    
    *   (c) by sending it by post in a registered letter addressed to that person at his usual or last known place of abode in New Zealand.
    
    *   (d) by delivering or leaving it at or sending it by registered post to the registered office in the case of a company or the principal office or place of business in the case of a local authority or other body, whether corporate or unincorporate.
    
    (7) Any forestry encouragement agreement which varies supplements or is in substitution for an earlier forestry encouragement agreement (whether that agreement is registered or not) may be registered under this section.
    
    (7A) For the purpose of [section 137][17] of the Land Transfer Act 1952, every forestry encouragement agreement shall be deemed to create an interest in the land to which it relates.
    
    (8) Upon the expiration or termination of a registered forestry encouragement agreement, the Conservator shall sign a certificate stating that the agreement has so expired or been terminated, and shall deposit the certificate with the Registrar, who shall thereupon, without fee, enter a memorial of the expiration or termination of the agreement on the register against the appropriate title.
    
    (8A) Where a Conservator deposits with the Registrar a certificate stating that a forestry encouragement agreement has been terminated, and at the same time deposits with the Registrar for registration a further forestry encouragement agreement upon which is endorsed a certificate by the Conservator that it is in substitution for the terminated agreement, and that the agreement in substitution relates to the same advance and the same land as the terminated agreement and includes provision for a lower rate of interest, the agreement in substitution when registered shall, for the purposes of [section 7][8], be deemed to have been registered when the original agreement was registered; and the Registrar shall record a memorial to that effect against the title to the land affected.
    
    (9) In any case where, under [section 105][18] of the Land Transfer Act 1952 or otherwise, on a sale by a mortgagee or other person having a charge on any estate or interest in land, or on the registration of a transfer pursuant to such a sale,---
        
    *   (a) that estate or interest is discharged from any charge thereon arising under a certificate that relates to a forestry encouragement agreement and is registered under [section 7][8]; or
    
    *   (b) that estate or interest would have been so discharged if such a certificate had been so registered---
    
    that agreement shall thereupon be deemed to cease to be registered against the title to the land, unless the purchaser and the Minister, by consent in writing endorsed on or attached to the instrument of transfer, agree to the retention of its registration against that title.
    
    (10) Forestry encouragement agreements shall be deemed to be mortgages for the purposes of [section 102][19] of the Land Transfer Act 1952 and mortgages to Her Majesty for the purposes of section 461 of the Maori Affairs Act 1953\.
    
    (10A) Forestry encouragement agreements, whether entered into before or after the close of 31 December 2007, must be treated as mortgages for the purposes of [sections 90 to 92][20] of the Property Law Act 2007; and the Minister must be treated as a mortgagee of the leasehold estate or interest for the purposes of [section 249(1)(a)][21] of that Act.
    
    (11) The provisions of this Act relating to the registration of forestry encouragement agreements shall, so far as they are applicable and with the necessary modifications, apply to the registration of memoranda of variation of those agreements:
    
    provided that notice need not be given to any mortgagee or other person having a charge on any estate or interest in the land at the date of registration of the variation, if that mortgagee or person will not be prejudiced by the variation.

##### 6 Registered forestry encouragement agreements to run with the land
    
*   (1) While the forestry encouragement agreement is registered against the title of any owner or occupier to any land, and until the expiry of the agreement by effluxion of time or (where the agreement is registered against the title of a lessee) the sooner determination of the lease and every renewal thereof by effluxion of time or otherwise, the agreement shall run at law with the land against the title to which it is registered, so as to confer and impose upon every person who at the date of registration of the agreement, or at any time thereafter, is for the time being the occupier of that land or of any part thereof, a right to enforce and an obligation to observe and perform the agreement during the period of his occupancy of the land or of any part thereof in the same manner as if the occupier had been a party to the agreement. Where there are 2 or more such occupiers, the obligation and liability so imposed on them shall be borne by them in such manner as the Minister and those occupiers may agree or in default of agreement shall be borne by those occupiers jointly.
    
    (2) Where the lessee for the time being under any lease of the land or of any part thereof surrenders his lease and obtains a new lease in exchange therefor, the forestry encouragement agreement and the provisions of this Act shall continue to apply as if the new lease were a renewal of the surrendered lease.
    
    (3) Upon the registration of any such new lease or of the renewal of any lease, the Registrar shall record on the register against the title to the land of the lessee under the new or renewed lease any subsisting memorial in respect of the agreement recorded against the title to the land of the lessee in respect of the surrendered or expired lease.
    
    (4) Where the lessee for the time being under any lease of the land or of any part thereof obtains a title in fee simple to the land or any part thereof, the forestry encouragement agreement and the provisions of this Act shall continue to apply to the land to which the title in fee simple has been obtained as if the agreement, so far as it affects that land, had been made with the legal owner in fee simple of the land. Upon the registration of any such title in fee simple, the Registrar shall record in the register against the title to the land of the owner of the fee simple any memorial in respect of the agreement recorded against the title to the land of the lessee at the time of the acquisition of the title in fee simple.
    
    (5) No forestry encouragement agreement which runs with the land in accordance with this section shall confer any right or impose any personal liability on any party to the agreement or any occupier of the land, except in respect of the period of his occupation of the land:
    
    provided that nothing in this subsection shall affect the amount of any charge on the estate or interest in the land affected by the agreement arising under subsection (2) of [section 7][8]:
    
    provided also that, where the agreement is registered against the title to a lease which determines before the expiry of the agreement, the personal liability of the person who was the lessee immediately before the determination shall, for the purposes of subsection (1), continue until the expiry of the agreement as if he were still the occupier of the land to which the lease related.

##### 7 Money payable under registered forestry encouragement agreement may be made a charge on the land
    
*   (1) If at any time there is default in the observance or performance of any of the obligations which are specified in the forestry encouragement agreement, the Conservator may deposit with the Registrar a certificate under his hand specifying the amount payable and unpaid under the agreement in respect of the default, and the Registrar shall thereupon, without fee, register the certificate in respect of the estate or interest in the land affected by the agreement.
    
    (2) Upon registration of the certificate, the amount mentioned therein, and all money which after the signing of the certificate and before the release thereof accrues due under the forestry encouragement agreement, shall, until payment thereof, be a charge on the said estate or interest in the land affected by the agreement. Every charge in respect of which a certificate is registered under subsection (1) shall have priority in relation to all other transactions affecting the land as if it had been registered or is deemed (under subsection (8A) of [section 5][6], as inserted by section 8(2) of the Forestry Encouragement Amendment Act 1965) to have been registered at the time when the forestry encouragement agreement was registered under this Act, and [section 105][18] of the Land Transfer Act 1952 shall apply as if the charge arose under a mortgage and created an estate or interest in the land. Any priority of any such charge, or (where the charge has not yet arisen) the right to any such priority which will arise from the prior registration of the relevant forestry encouragement agreement and the subsequent registration of a certificate under subsection (1) relative thereto, may be postponed or advanced or otherwise varied wholly or in part in relation to any other charge or lien of any description by the registration without fee in the office of the appropriate Registrar,---
        
    *   (a) where the land affected is subject to the [Land Transfer Act 1952][12], of a memorandum of priority under [section 103][23] of that Act signed by the Minister or a Conservator and by the registered owner of the land and any person who is detrimentally affected thereby; or
    
    *   (b) where the land affected is not subject to the [Land Transfer Act 1952][12], of a memorandum of priority in like form signed by the Minister or a Conservator and by the registered owner of the land and any person who is detrimentally affected thereby, which memorandum shall have the effect of a deed.
    
    (2A) For the purposes of paragraph (a) of subsection (2), a registered forestry encouragement agreement shall be deemed to be a charge within the meaning of [section 103][23] of the Land Transfer Act 1952\.
    
    (2B) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Act or any other Act, the effect of the registration of a memorandum of priority as aforesaid postponing the priority of a forestry encouragement agreement shall, except as expressly provided in the memorandum, be to postpone the priority arising from the registration of any certificate relative to that agreement registered under subsection (1) in the manner and to the extent that the priority of the agreement is postponed by the memorandum.
    
    (3) Where any occupier has an interest in the land as lessee under a lease, the charge shall extend to the interest (if any) of the lessee in any improvements to the land and in any money that may be payable by the lessor and by an incoming tenant and otherwise for any such improvements, whether during the term of the lease or thereafter.
    
    (4) For the purpose of enforcing any charge under this section, the High Court or a Judge thereof may make such order as it or he thinks fit, either for the sale of the estate or interest which is subject to a charge, or for the appointment of a receiver or otherwise; and any order for sale shall be carried into effect by the Sheriff in the same manner as in the case of a writ for sale, with any modifications that may be necessary or may be provided by rules of court in that behalf:
    
    provided that, in the case of Maori freehold land within the meaning of the Maori Affairs Act 1953, the charge shall be enforceable against the owner of that land only by the appointment of a receiver in accordance with section 33 of that Act and subsections (3) to (5) of that section shall apply to the receiver so appointed.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Forestry Encouragement Act 1962\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 January 2008, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][28] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][29] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][30] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][31] and [17E][32] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
