    And whereas for the same years payment was also made to certain of those education boards of other grants and allowances more particularly described in paragraphs (b) to (d) at a higher rate than the rate for those years payable under those regulations:
    
    And whereas it is desired to validate and authorise those payments:

    And whereas it is desired to validate and authorise the payment of those grants: 
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    Payment of the following amounts shall be deemed to have been validly made, and always to have been validly made, in every way as if the paying of those amounts had been expressly authorised under the Secondary School Grants Regulations 1967:

*   Whereas for the year that ended with 31 December 1971 the Wairarapa Automobile Association Mutual Insurance Company transmitted to the Fire Service Council a return that mistakenly showed the total gross amount of premiums received by the company in respect of motor vehicle comprehensive insurance increased by 3% of that amount, instead of showing only 3% of that amount as required by section 52 of the Fire Services Act 1949; 
    
    And whereas under the said section 52 the company has transmitted to the Council an amended return; 
    
    And whereas it is desired that the contribution payable to the Council by the company, as already determined in accordance with the return first made by the company, be redetermined in accordance with the amended return; 
    
    And whereas the Council has already estimated its probable expenditure for the year ending with 31 March 1973, and, on the basis of the return first made by the company, has forwarded to each insurance company liable to contribute under the said Act a statement showing the amount payable by the company mentioned in the statement; 
    
    And whereas it is desired that the Council borrow money by way of overdraft from its bankers for the purpose of meeting its expenditure for the year ending with 31 March 1973;

    (2) Notwithstanding anything in the Fire Services Act 1949, the Local Authorities Loans Act 1956, or any other Act, the Fire Service Council is hereby authorised---
        
    *   (a) to borrow by way of overdraft from its bankers such amounts, not exceeding in total the sum of $71,093.49 together with interest and other charges, required as a result of the provisions of subsection (1), for the purposes of meeting any deficiency in the funds of the Council in its expenditure for the year ending with 31 March 1973: 
    
    *   (b) to require such increases in the contributions payable by insurance companies liable to contribute under the Fire Services Act 1949 for the year ending with 31 March 1974 as are in direct proportion to the liability of those companies to contribute in respect of the returns transmitted by them to the Council for the year that ended with 31 December 1971 for the purposes of recovering the total sum, not exceeding $71,093.49 together with interest and other charges, borrowed by way of overdraft as mentioned in paragraph (a).

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Finance Act 1972\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 25 January 2005, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][24] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][25] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][26] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][27] and [17E][28] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
