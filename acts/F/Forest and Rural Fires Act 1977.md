##### 21 Prohibition of certain operations during periods of extreme fire hazard
    
*   (1) When weather or other conditions arise that, in the opinion of a Fire Officer for any district, present an extreme fire hazard whereby life and property may be endangered by the outbreak or spreading of fires in, into, or from that district, his Principal Fire Officer or the Fire Officer (with the approval or confirmation of his Principal Fire Officer) may issue, or cause to be issued, by broadcast or other effective means, an order by way of fire control measure in respect of such area as may be specified in the order, whether within that district or not, in the public interest, and notwithstanding any other enactment---
        
    *   (a) prohibiting the lighting of fires in the open air; and
    
    *   (b) except in respect of essential services where adequate precautions against the outbreak or spread of fire are taken, prohibiting in whole or in part the carrying on or continuation of any pursuits, operations, occupations, or other activities, whether commercial, domestic, recreational, educational, or otherwise howsoever, that he considers may cause a fire to start in, or to spread in, into, or from the district, or directing that they may be carried on or continued only subject to such conditions and restrictions as the Principal Fire Officer may impose, approve or confirm; and
    
    *   (c) where considered necessary by the Principal Fire Officer, directing that no person other than a person residing or working therein shall enter the whole or any specified part of the area except for the purposes or otherwise as determined by the order or in respect of essential services where adequate precautions against the outbreak or spread of fire are taken---
    
    and every person who, without the authority of a special permit issued pursuant to [section 24][36], fails or refuses to comply with the requirements of any such order commits an offence against this Act.
    
    (2) Where there is no Fire Authority for the whole or any part of any area to be affected by an order under this section, during the period that an order so issued by a Principal Fire Officer or by a Fire Officer remains in force, the Fire Authority for the district to which that Fire Officer belongs shall be deemed the Fire Authority for that area or part and every Fire Officer for that district shall be deemed a Fire Officer for that area or part.
    
    (3) In any case where by reason of an order under this section persons are required to cease their usual work and their employers are unable to find other employment for them the Fire Authority may, if it thinks fit and subject to such conditions as it may impose, make a contribution towards the wages of those men. Where the Fire Authority is the Minister of Conservation, such contribution shall be paid out of money appropriated by Parliament for the purpose. In all cases the contribution may be by grant, subsidy, reimbursement, or otherwise, and may, as seems fitting to the Fire Authority, be paid to those persons or those employers.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Forest and Rural Fires Act 1977\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 July 2013, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][219] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][220] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][221] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][222] and [17E][223] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
