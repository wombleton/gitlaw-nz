##### 13 Total allowable catch
    
*   (1) Subject to this section, the Minister shall, by notice in the _Gazette_, set in respect of the quota management area relating to each quota management stock a total allowable catch for that stock, and that total allowable catch shall continue to apply in each fishing year for that stock unless varied under this section, or until an alteration of the quota management area for that stock takes effect in accordance with [sections 25][40] and [26][43].
    
    (2) The Minister shall set a total allowable catch that---
        
    *   (a) maintains the stock at or above a level that can produce the maximum sustainable yield, having regard to the interdependence of stocks; or
    
    *   (b) enables the level of any stock whose current level is below that which can produce the maximum sustainable yield to be altered---
            
        *   (i) in a way and at a rate that will result in the stock being restored to or above a level that can produce the maximum sustainable yield, having regard to the interdependence of stocks; and
        
        *   (ii) within a period appropriate to the stock, having regard to the biological characteristics of the stock and any environmental conditions affecting the stock; or
        
        
    
    *   (c) enables the level of any stock whose current level is above that which can produce the maximum sustainable yield to be altered in a way and at a rate that will result in the stock moving towards or above a level that can produce the maximum sustainable yield, having regard to the interdependence of stocks.
    
    (2A) For the purposes of setting a total allowable catch under this section, if the Minister considers that the current level of the stock or the level of the stock that can produce the maximum sustainable yield is not able to be estimated reliably using the best available information, the Minister must---
        
    *   (a) not use the absence of, or any uncertainty in, that information as a reason for postponing or failing to set a total allowable catch for the stock; and
    
    *   (b) have regard to the interdependence of stocks, the biological characteristics of the stock, and any environmental conditions affecting the stock; and
    
    *   (c) set a total allowable catch---
            
        *   (i) using the best available information; and
        
        *   (ii) that is not inconsistent with the objective of maintaining the stock at or above, or moving the stock towards or above, a level that can produce the maximum sustainable yield.
        
        
    
    (3) In considering the way in which and rate at which a stock is moved towards or above a level that can produce maximum sustainable yield under subsection (2)(b) or (c), or (2A) (if applicable), the Minister shall have regard to such social, cultural, and economic factors as he or she considers relevant.
    
    (4) The Minister may from time to time, by notice in the _Gazette_, vary any total allowable catch set for any quota management stock under this section by increasing or reducing the total allowable catch. When considering any variation, the Minister is to have regard to the matters specified in subsections (2), (2A) (if applicable), and (3).
    
    (5) Without limiting subsection (1) or subsection (4), the Minister may set or vary any total allowable catch at, or to, zero.
    
    (6) Except as provided in subsection (7), every setting or variation of a total allowable catch shall have effect on and from the first day of the next fishing year for the stock concerned.
    
    (7) After considering information about the abundance during the current fishing year of any stock listed in [Schedule 2][695], and after having regard to the matters specified in subsections (2), (2A) (if applicable), and (3), the Minister may, by notice in the _Gazette_, increase the total allowable catch for the stock with effect from such date in the fishing year in which the notice is published as may be stated in the notice.
    
    (8) If a total allowable catch for any stock has been increased during any fishing year under subsection (7), the total allowable catch for that stock shall, at the close of that fishing year, revert to the total allowable catch that applied to that stock at the beginning of that fishing year; but this subsection does not prevent a variation under subsection (4) of the total allowable catch that applied at the beginning of that fishing year.
    
    (9) The Governor-General may from time to time, by Order in Council, omit the name of any stock from [Schedule 2][695] or add to that schedule the name of any stock whose abundance is highly variable from year to year.
    
    (10) Subsection (1) does not require the Minister to set an initial total allowable catch for any quota management area and stock unless the Minister also proposes to set or vary a total allowable commercial catch for that area and stock under [section 20][34].

    *   (a) the stock is taken primarily as an incidental catch during the taking of 1 or more other stocks and is only a small proportion of the combined catch of the stock and other stock or stocks; and
    
    *   (b) the total benefits of managing the stock at a level other than that permitted under [section 13][19] outweigh the total costs; and
    
    *   (c) managing the stock at a level other than that permitted under [section 13][19] will have no detrimental effects on non-commercial fishing interests in that stock; and
    
    *   (d) the stock is able to be maintained above a level that ensures its long-term viability; and
    
    *   (e) the purpose of the Act would be better achieved by setting a total allowable catch otherwise than in accordance with [section 13][19].

    (2) Subject to subsection (3), the Minister must set a total allowable catch under subsection (1) that is no greater than a level that will allow the taking of another stock or stocks in accordance with the total allowable catch and the total allowable commercial catch set for that other stock or stocks.
    
    (3) The Minister must set a total allowable catch that maintains the stock above a level that ensures its long-term viability.
    
    (4) When setting a total allowable catch under subsection (1), the Minister must be satisfied that quota owners have taken, and will continue to take, all reasonable steps (including, but not limited to, modifying fishing methods, fishing areas, and times of fishing) to minimise take of the stock.
    
    (5) Every total allowable catch set under subsection (1) for any stock continues to apply in each fishing year for the stock unless varied under subsection (6).

    (3) The Minister may require, or authorise the chief executive to require, any person or class of persons listed in [section 189][388] to give to the Minister or the chief executive such information relating to fishing-related mortality as the Minister or chief executive, as the case may be, considers necessary, and may require, or authorise the chief executive to require, such information to be given in the approved manner and form.
    
    (4) The Minister may recommend the making of such regulations under [section 298][581] as the Minister considers necessary or expedient for the purpose of implementing any measures referred to in subsection (1) or subsection (2) or subsection (3).
    
    (5) The Minister may, by notice in the _Gazette_, prohibit all or any fishing or fishing methods in an area either---
        
    *   (a) under subsection (1)(a), for the purpose of ensuring the maximum allowable fishing-related mortality level set by the relevant population management plan is not exceeded; or

##### 17B Determination that stock or species be subject to quota management system
    
*   (1) The Minister must make a determination under subsection (2) if satisfied that the current management of a stock or species---
        
    *   (a) is not ensuring the sustainability of the stock or species; or
    
    *   (b) is not providing for the utilisation of the stock or species.
    
    (2) The Minister must determine to make the stock or species concerned subject to the quota management system, unless he or she determines that the purpose of this Act would be better met by setting 1 or more sustainability measures under [section 11][16] (other than a total allowable catch set under [section 13][19] or [section 14][20]).
    
    (3) Before determining whether the criteria in subsection (1)(a) or (b) have been satisfied, and before making a determination under subsection (2) the Minister must consult those persons or organisations considered by the Minister to be representative of the classes of persons who have an interest in the relevant determination.

        *   (iii) the stock or species concerned must be removed from [Schedule 4C][700] from the first day of that fishing year following the date of the notification, and the notice must amend Schedule 4C (including any appropriate consequential amendments) accordingly.
        
        
    
    (6) Despite subsection (2), the Minister may not determine under that subsection to make subject to the quota management system any stock of highly migratory species outside New Zealand fisheries waters except to give effect to---
        
    *   (a) a national allocation to New Zealand by an international fisheries organisation in relation to that stock; or
    
    *   (b) any other management measures to which New Zealand has agreed, made by an international fisheries organisation in relation to that stock.

    *   (b) state the fishing year in respect of the stock, which year shall be a 12-month period commencing on either 1 April or 1 October:
    
    *   (c) state whether, for the stock concerned, the total allowable commercial catch is, and annual catch entitlements are, to be expressed in meatweight or greenweight:
    
    *   (d) make provision for such other matters as may be contemplated by this Act.
    
    (2) In defining the quota management area, the Minister shall, as far as practicable, maintain the same quota management areas for different species.
    
    (2A) In the case of a stock or species listed in [Schedule 4C][700], the notice must amend that schedule by removing the stock or species concerned (and may make any amendments consequential on that removal) with effect on and from the date on which the stock becomes subject to the quota management system.
    
    (3) If the Minister is satisfied that any species in the waters around the Chatham Islands can, for fisheries management purposes, be managed effectively as a unit, a notice under [section 18][32] may create around the Chatham Islands a separate quota management area for that species.
    
    (4) Subject to subsections (5), (5A), and (6),---
        
    *   (a) no declaration made under [section 18][32] shall be revoked; and

    (5A) Without limiting subsection (5)(c), the Minister may amend a declaration under [section 18][32] at any time before the allocation of provisional catch history under [section 36][62], if the declaration was made on the basis of incorrect or misleading information, or as a result of a mistake.
    
    (6) A provision in a regulation made under this Act, or in a notice given under [section 15][24] or [section 16][25] or a regulation made under [section 186(2)(b)][327], shall not be construed as altering a quota management area merely because it prohibits, limits, or restricts fishing in the quota management area.
    
    (7) Before making a declaration under [section 18][32] or amending a declaration under subsection (5A), the Minister must consult the persons or organisations considered by the Minister to be representative of those classes of persons having an interest in the matters referred to in subsection (1).

##### 22 Effect of reduction of total allowable commercial catch
    
*   (1) If the Crown owns any unencumbered quota shares for a stock as at the date the total allowable commercial catch for that stock is reduced under [section 20][34], the chief executive shall transfer to every quota owner at the time the reduction takes effect, in the form in which that quota is held by that person, a number of quota shares calculated in accordance with the following formula:
    
    a ÷ (100 000 000 -- b) × c = d
    
    where---
    
    **a**
    > 
    > is the number of quota shares for the stock held by the person immediately before the reduction in the total allowable commercial catch for the stock takes effect; and
    
    **b**
    > 
    > is the number of unencumbered quota shares for the stock owned by the Crown immediately before the reduction in the total allowable commercial catch for the stock takes effect; and
    
    **c**
    > 
    > is the lesser of---
    >     
    > *   (a) the number of unencumbered quota shares for the stock owned by the Crown immediately before the reduction in the total allowable commercial catch for the stock takes effect:
    >

    > 
    > 
    
    **d**
    > 
    > is the number of quota shares to be transferred to the quota owner under this section.
    
    (2) If there has been a reduction in the total allowable commercial catch for any stock but the Crown does not hold any unencumbered quota shares for that stock as at the date the reduction takes effect, no deductions or transfers of quota shall be made under this section.
    
    (3) The chief executive shall, as soon as practicable after the reduction takes effect, notify every quota owner affected by a reduction in the total allowable commercial catch for any stock of---
        
    *   (a) the reduced total allowable commercial catch; and
    
    *   (b) any consequential change in the number of the quota shares for that stock that are owned by that person; and
    
    *   (c) the quota weight equivalent of 1 quota share of the reduced total allowable commercial catch.

##### 23 Effect of increase in total allowable commercial catch
    
*   (1) If the total allowable commercial catch for any stock has been increased under [section 20][34] and any person (in this section called an _eligible person_) holds preferential allocation rights for that stock, the chief executive shall deduct from every person owning quota for that stock as at the date the increase takes effect the number of quota shares calculated in accordance with the following formula:

    **b**
    > 
    > is the total allowable commercial catch for the stock (in kilogrammes) applying immediately before the increase takes effect; and
    
    **c**

    > 
    
    **d**

    > is the number of quota shares to be deducted from each person's holdings and transferred to the Crown in accordance with this section.
    
    (2) Immediately after deducting quota shares under subsection (1), the chief executive shall transfer to each eligible person a number of quota shares which shall be calculated in accordance with the following formula:
    
    a ÷ b × c × 100 000 000 ÷ (d + c) = e
    
    where---
    
    **a**
    > 
    > is the eligible person's current preferential allocation rights for the stock (in kilogrammes); and

    (3) Every person who was, immediately before the commencement of this section, entitled to quota under [section 28OE(1)(a)][821] of the Fisheries Act 1983 is entitled to a preferential allocation right equivalent to the amount (in kilogrammes) of the reduction in that person's provisional maximum individual transferable quota for the stock under [section 28N][822] of that Act less the amount (in kilogrammes) of any quota allocated to that person under section 28OE(1)(a) of that Act, but that preferential allocation right (which entitles the holder to receive quota shares under subsection (2))---
        
    *   (a) shall have effect only while that person continues to be registered on the Quota Register as the owner of shares for that stock, and those shares have been continuously owned by that person since the commencement of this section; and
    
    *   (b) is personal to the eligible person who holds the right and is not transferable in any circumstances.
    
    (4) The amount of an eligible person's preferential allocation right must be reduced in accordance with the following formula:

    > 
    > 
    
    **d**
    > 
    > is the amount of the reduction in the eligible person's preferential allocation right (in kilogrammes).
    
    (4A) An eligible person's preferential allocation right expires if the amount of that right equals zero.
    
    (4B) An eligible person is not entitled to receive, in the aggregate under subsection (2), quota shares whose quota weight equivalent (calculated at the time of transfer of the relevant shares to the eligible person) exceeds the amount of preferential allocation right held by that person on the commencement of this section or on the date of allocation of quota to that person under [section 337][631], as the case may be.
    
    (5) If the total allowable commercial catch for any stock is increased but there are no eligible persons in relation to that stock, no deductions or transfers of quota shall be made under this section.
    
    (6) The chief executive shall, as soon as practicable after any increase in the total allowable commercial catch for any stock takes effect, cause every quota owner affected by the increase to be notified of---
        
    *   (a) the increased total allowable commercial catch; and
    
    *   (b) any consequential change in the number of the quota shares for that stock owned by that person; and

    *   (c) \[Repealed\]
    
    (4A) Any quota remaining unallocated under subsection (3)(d) is the property of the Crown subject to [section 49][77].

##### 66 Generation of annual catch entitlement at beginning of new fishing year
    
*   (1) On the first day of each fishing year, quota shall generate annual catch entitlement.
    
    (2) The chief executive shall, in respect of each quota management stock, calculate as at the first day of each fishing year the amount of annual catch entitlement that would be generated by the amount of quota owned by each quota owner, in accordance with the following formula:
    
    (a ÷ 100 000 000) × b = c
    
    where---
    
    **a**
    > 
    > is the number of quota shares held by the quota owner; and
    
    **b**
    > 
    > is the total allowable commercial catch (expressed in kilogrammes); and

    *   (a) the sum of all annual catch entitlements equals the applicable total allowable commercial catch for the stock; and
    
    *   (b) only whole kilogrammes of annual catch entitlement are generated.
    
    

##### 67 Allocation of annual catch entitlement
    
*   (1) On the first day of each fishing year, the chief executive must allocate to each quota owner the person's annual catch entitlement for any quota management stock that has been generated under [section 66][120].

    *   (a) the chief executive must calculate the amount of annual catch entitlement that each person would have received under subsection (1) if the altered total allowable commercial catch had been in effect at the beginning of the fishing year, and an annual catch entitlement had been generated under [section 66][120] accordingly; and
    
    *   (b) the chief executive must, on or before the first day of the Foveaux Strait dredge oyster season, allocate to each person who receives an amount of annual catch entitlement under subsection (1) for Foveaux Strait dredge oysters a further amount of annual catch entitlement for that stock calculated in accordance with the following formula:
        
        a -- b = c
        
        where---
        
        **a**

    (4) \[Repealed\]
    
    (5) Any annual catch entitlement calculated under this section shall be rounded up or rounded down by the chief executive to ensure that no quota owner holds part of a kilogramme of annual catch entitlement as a result of an allocation.
    
    (6) Any annual catch entitlement allocated under this section shall have effect for all purposes of this Act on and from the date of allocation.
    
    (7) The chief executive shall, as soon as practicable after allocating any annual catch entitlement in accordance with this section, notify every quota owner of the amount of annual catch entitlement allocated to that quota owner under this section.
    
    (8) The chief executive shall, as soon as practicable after allocating any annual catch entitlement in accordance with this section, notify the relevant Registrar of Annual Catch Entitlement of the amount of annual catch entitlement allocated to each quota owner.

##### 67A Allocation of additional annual catch entitlement in case of underfishing
    
*   (1) As soon as practicable after the 15th day after the end of the fishing year for each stock (_the first fishing year_), the chief executive must, for each person who, as at that date, owns annual catch entitlement for the first fishing year for that stock, compare---
        
    *   (a) the annual catch entitlement for that stock (other than annual catch entitlement created under [section 68][124]) for the first fishing year owned by the person as at the close of the 15th day after the end of that fishing year; and
    
    *   (b) the reported catch (if any) for that stock, calculated in accordance with regulations made for that purpose under [section 297][580], taken by that person during the first fishing year.
    
    (2) If the amount of annual catch entitlement referred to in subsection (1)(a) is greater than the reported catch referred to in subsection (1)(b), the chief executive must---
        
    *   (a) calculate the difference between that annual catch entitlement and that reported catch; and
    
    *   (b) subject to subsection (5), allocate to the person an amount of annual catch entitlement for the stock for the fishing year after the first fishing year (_the second fishing year_) that is the lesser of the following:
            
        *   (i) the amount calculated under paragraph (a):
        
        *   (ii) 10% of the amount of annual catch entitlement referred to in subsection (1)(a).
        
        
    
    (3) This section does not apply to---
        
    *   (a) a stock listed in [Schedule 5A][703]; or
    
    *   (b) a stock for which the total allowable commercial catch at the beginning of the second fishing year is less than the total allowable commercial catch applying at the close of the first fishing year.
    
    (4) The chief executive must allocate annual catch entitlement under this section as soon as practicable after the 15th day after the end of the first fishing year.
    
    (5) The amount of annual catch entitlement allocated under subsection (2) must be rounded up or rounded down by the chief executive to the nearest kilogramme or, in the case of Foveaux Strait dredge oysters, to the nearest whole number of oysters.
    
    (6) Any annual catch entitlement allocated under subsection (2)---
        
    *   (a) is in addition to any annual catch entitlement generated under [section 66][120] or created under [section 68][124]; and
    
    *   (b) has effect for all purposes under this Act on and from the date of the allocation.
    
    (7) The chief executive must, as soon as practicable after allocating any annual catch entitlement under subsection (2),---
        
    *   (a) notify every person to whom annual catch entitlement has been allocated under this section of the amount of annual catch entitlement allocated to that person; and

##### 68 Minister to create additional annual catch entitlement if total allowable catch increased during fishing year
    
*   (1) If---
        
    *   (a) the total allowable catch in respect of any stock is increased during a fishing year in accordance with [section 13(7)][19] or [section 14(6)][20]; and
    
    *   (b) the Minister believes that, after considering the matters referred to in [section 21(1)][35], he or she would have increased the total allowable commercial catch but for [section 20(4)][34],---
    
    the Minister shall create an additional amount of annual catch entitlement for the stock that equals the amount by which he or she would have increased the total allowable commercial catch.
    
    (2) Subject to subsections (2A), (2B), and (3), the chief executive shall allocate to every person owning quota for the stock an amount of the annual catch entitlement created by the Minister under subsection (1) calculated in accordance with the following formula:
    
    (a ÷ 100 000 000) × b = c
    
    where---
    
    **a**
    > 
    > is the number of quota shares held by the quota owner on the date the increase in the total allowable catch takes effect; and

    > is the amount (expressed in kilogrammes) of annual catch entitlement to be allocated under this section to the quota owner.
    
    (2A) Where---
        
    *   (a) an increase in the total allowable catch for a highly migratory species is a result of an agreement, consistent with the rules or procedures established by the relevant international fisheries organisation, between New Zealand and another member of the international fisheries organisation; and
    
    *   (b) the Minister is satisfied that the basis for the increase in the total allowable catch justifies a different allocation mechanism,---
    
    the Minister may determine how the additional annual catch entitlement is to be allocated in a manner different to that specified in subsection (2), taking into account the nature and basis of the agreement between New Zealand and the other member of the international fisheries organisation.
    
    (2B) The chief executive must allocate the additional catch entitlement in accordance with any determination of the Minister under subsection (2A).
    
    (3) Any annual catch entitlement calculated under subsection (2) or subsections (2A) and (2B) that any quota owner is entitled to be allocated under this section shall be rounded up or rounded down by the chief executive to ensure that---
        
    *   (a) the sum of all annual catch entitlements allocated under this section equals the amount of the increase that would have been made to the total allowable commercial catch but for [section 20(4)][34]; and
    
    *   (b) no quota owner holds part of a kilogramme of annual catch entitlement consequent upon such allocation.
    
    (4) The chief executive shall, after any rounding under subsection (3), notify every quota owner of the amount of annual catch entitlement allocated to that quota owner under this section.

    (2) Subsection (1) does not apply if the stock is listed in [Schedule 6][704] and the commercial fisher complies with the requirements set out in that schedule.
    
    (3) Any commercial fisher who takes any fish, aquatic life, or seaweed subject to the quota management system that is not of legal size shall immediately return that fish, aquatic life, or seaweed, whether alive or dead, to the sea or waters from which the fish, aquatic life, or seaweed was taken.

##### 74 Minimum holdings of annual catch entitlement
    
*   (1) No commercial fisher may take any stock listed in [Schedule 8][706] unless the fisher holds, at the time of the taking, the minimum amount of annual catch entitlement that is specified in that schedule in relation to that stock.
    
    (2) If,---
        
    *   (a) following the allocation of quota under [section 44][72] or [section 47][75] or [section 52][90], the amount of quota owned by a commercial fisher does not generate an annual catch entitlement sufficient to satisfy the requirements of subsection (1); or
    
    *   (b) following a reduction in the total allowable commercial catch, the amount of quota owned by a commercial fisher, as at the beginning of the fishing year in which the reduction takes effect, does not generate an annual catch entitlement sufficient to satisfy the requirements of subsection (1); or
    
    *   (c) following an alteration of a quota management area under [section 25][40], quota is allocated under [section 26][43] to a commercial fisher and that quota does not generate an annual catch entitlement sufficient to satisfy the requirements of subsection (1); or
    
    *   (d) following an increase in the amount of annual catch entitlement required to be held by virtue of an Order in Council under subsection (7), the amount of relevant quota owned by a commercial fisher, as at the beginning of the fishing year in which the increase takes effect, does not generate an annual catch entitlement sufficient to satisfy that requirement; or
    
    *   (e) following a deduction of quota shares from any person by the chief executive under [section 52][90], the amount of relevant quota owned by a commercial fisher, as at the beginning of the fishing year immediately following the year in which the deduction occurs, does not generate an annual catch entitlement sufficient to satisfy the requirements of subsection (1),---
    
    then the requirements of subsection (1) shall apply as if the minimum amount of annual catch entitlement required to be held was the amount of annual catch entitlement actually generated by the commercial fisher's relevant quota, and the commercial fisher may continue to take stock in each fishing year under the authority of the lesser amount of annual catch entitlement held by the commercial fisher unless the commercial fisher, in any particular fishing year, transfers any annual catch entitlement and thereby reduces the commercial fisher's annual catch entitlement holding for that fishing year to an amount lower than the holding generated by the commercial fisher's quota at the commencement of that year.
    
    (2A) As soon as is reasonably practicable after Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Limited has notified the chief executive of the entities that it has approved under [section 34][920] of the Maori Fisheries Act 2004, the chief executive must identify the approved entities on the Annual Catch Entitlement Register.
    
    (2B) In the case of a quota holding that includes settlement quota, if the annual catch entitlement from that quota is transferred in full to a commercial fisher that is registered as an approved entity under subsection (2A), the annual catch entitlement must be treated as if it were not less than the minimum amount required under subsection (1).
    
    (3) Subsection (2) does not apply to a commercial fisher referred to in paragraph (b) or paragraph (c) or paragraph (d) or paragraph (e) of that subsection unless, immediately before becoming a person referred to in any of those paragraphs, the commercial fisher owned a number of quota shares that would generate an amount of annual catch entitlement sufficient to satisfy the relevant requirements of subsection (1).
    
    (4) If any commercial fisher is or becomes subject to subsection (2), that subsection shall continue to apply for only so long as the commercial fisher does not sell any of the relevant quota, however obtained.
    
    (5) If any commercial fisher is or becomes subject to subsection (2) and the commercial fisher subsequently purchases any relevant quota, the requirements of subsection (1) apply on and from the commencement of the next fishing year as if the minimum amount of annual catch entitlement required to be held was the amount of annual catch entitlement actually generated by the commercial fisher's quota (including such purchased quota) unless that amount exceeds the applicable amount specified in subsection (1); and subsection (2) shall cease to apply to that commercial fisher.

#### Deemed values

##### 75 Minister to set deemed value rates
    
*   (1) For each quota management stock, the Minister must, by notice in the _Gazette_, set an interim deemed value rate and an annual deemed value rate for that stock, and those rates continue to apply in each fishing year for that stock unless varied under this section.
    
    (2) In setting an interim deemed value rate or an annual deemed value rate, the Minister---
        
    *   (a) must take into account the need to provide an incentive for every commercial fisher to acquire or maintain sufficient annual catch entitlement in respect of each fishing year that is not less than the total catch of that stock taken by that commercial fisher; and
    
    *   (b) may have regard to---
            
        *   (i) the desirability of commercial fishers landing catch for which they do not have annual catch entitlement; and
        
        *   (ii) the market value of the annual catch entitlement for the stock; and
        
        *   (iii) the market value of the stock; and
        
        *   (iv) the economic benefits obtained by the most efficient commercial fisher, licensed fish receiver, retailer, or any other person from the taking, processing, or sale of the fish, aquatic life, or seaweed, or of any other fish, aquatic life, or seaweed that is commonly taken in association with the fish, aquatic life, or seaweed; and
        
        *   (v) the extent to which catch of that stock has exceeded or is likely to exceed the total allowable commercial catch for the stock in any year; and
        
        *   (vi) any other matters that the Minister considers relevant.
        
        
    
    (3) The Minister must set annual deemed value rates for a stock that are greater than interim deemed value rates set for that stock.
    
    (4) The Minister may set different annual deemed value rates in respect of the same stock which apply to different levels of catch in excess of annual catch entitlement.
    
    (5) The Minister may set an interim deemed value rate and an annual deemed value rate in respect of fish, aquatic life, or seaweed landed and received by a licensed fish receiver in the Chatham Islands that is different from the deemed value rate set in respect of fish, aquatic life, or seaweed of the same stock landed and received by a licensed fish receiver elsewhere.
    
    (6) The Minister must not---
        
    *   (a) have regard to the personal circumstances of any individual or class of person liable to pay the deemed value of any fish, aquatic life, or seaweed; or
    
    *   (b) set separate deemed value rates in individual cases---
    
    when setting an interim deemed value rate or an annual deemed value rate.
    
    (7) Any interim or annual deemed value rate set under this section may be varied by the Minister in the same manner, and any rate set or varied under this section takes effect on the first day of the next fishing year for the stock concerned.

##### 75A Requirement to consult in relation to deemed values
    
*   Before setting any interim deemed value rate or annual deemed value rate under [section 75][133], the Minister must, if practicable, consult persons or organisations that the Minister considers represent classes of persons who have an interest in the stock, including Maori, recreational, commercial, and environmental interests.

*   (1) A court must not hear or determine, and no person may make or commence, an application or other proceeding in respect of a decision or purported decision of the Minister to set an interim deemed value rate or an annual deemed value rate unless the application is, or the proceedings are, made or commenced within 3 months after the date on which the decision, or purported decision, is notified in the _Gazette_.
    
    (2) This section applies despite any other enactment or rule of law.

##### 76 Catch to be counted against annual catch entitlement
    
*   (1) In this section and [sections 76A][137], [78][141], [79][144], and [80][148], unless the context otherwise requires, _commercial fisher_ means any person who, at any time during the relevant fishing year,---
        
    *   (a) held a fishing permit or a high seas fishing permit; or
    
    *   (b) was a person using a New Zealand ship who, in the judgment of the chief executive, held a valid authority to fish against New Zealand's national allocation of highly migratory species in the national fisheries jurisdiction of a foreign country.
    
    (1A) As soon as practicable after the 15th day of each month (other than the first month) of every fishing year, the chief executive must, in accordance with regulations made for that purpose under [section 297][580], in respect of every commercial fisher,---
        
    *   (a) compare---
            
        *   (i) the annual catch entitlement for each stock (if any) for the fishing year owned by that commercial fisher as at the close of the 15th day of that month; and
        
        *   (ii) the reported catch for that stock (in kilogrammes) calculated in accordance with regulations made for that purpose under [section 297][580], taken by that commercial fisher during the fishing year up to the end of the preceding month; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) calculate, in respect of each stock, whether that commercial fisher's annual catch entitlement referred to in paragraph (a)(i) exceeds that commercial fisher's reported catch referred to in paragraph (a)(ii).
    
    (1B) As soon as practicable after the 15th day after the end of the fishing year for each stock, the chief executive must, in accordance with regulations made for that purpose under [section 297][580], in respect of every commercial fisher,---
        
    *   (a) compare---
            
        *   (i) the annual catch entitlement for each stock (if any) for the relevant fishing year owned by that commercial fisher as at the close of the 15th day after the end of the fishing year; and
        
        *   (ii) the reported catch for that stock (in kilogrammes), calculated in accordance with regulations made for that purpose under [section 297][580], taken by that commercial fisher during the fishing year up to the end of the fishing year; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) calculate, in respect of each stock, whether that commercial fisher's annual catch entitlement referred to in paragraph (a)(i) exceeds that commercial fisher's reported catch referred to in paragraph (a)(ii).
    
    (2) Following the calculation referred to in subsection (1A), the chief executive shall calculate the amount of interim deemed value that is to be demanded from, or remitted to, that commercial fisher in accordance with regulations made for the purpose under [section 297][580] and thereafter shall demand or remit the amount, as the case may be.
    
    (2A) Subject to subsection (2B), following the calculation referred to in subsection (1B), the chief executive must calculate the amount of annual deemed value (if any) that is to be demanded from the commercial fisher in accordance with regulations made for the purpose under [section 297][580], and must demand the amount.
    
    (2B) In calculating the amount of annual deemed value to be demanded from a commercial fisher, the chief executive must credit the commercial fisher with interim deemed value amounts demanded in respect of the relevant stock in the relevant fishing year (other than demanded amounts that have been remitted under subsection (2)).
    
    (2C) For the sole purpose of determining an appropriate annual deemed value under this section, if a fisher to whom subsection (1B) applies holds no annual catch entitlement for a stock in respect of which the Minister has set different deemed value rates under [section 75(4)][133], that fisher is deemed to hold 1 kilogramme of annual catch entitlement for that stock.
    
    (3) A demand for an amount of interim deemed value made by the chief executive under this section may be satisfied by---
        
    *   (a) payment of the sum of money so demanded; or
    
    *   (b) acquiring, for the relevant fishing year and within the time limit specified in [section 134][259], annual catch entitlement for the relevant stock; or
    
    *   (c) \[Repealed\]
    
    *   (d) any combination of those options.
    
    (3A) A demand for an amount of annual deemed value made by the chief executive under this section must be satisfied by payment of the sum of money so demanded.
    
    (4) Every person who is liable to satisfy any deemed value amount demanded under this section is required to satisfy the demand whether or not an offence has been committed against this Act.
    
    (5) All deemed value amounts are to be satisfied within 20 days after the demand is made and, if being satisfied by payment of money, the amount is payable to the chief executive and shall be held by the Crown on trust for the commercial fisher until the trust ends in accordance with this section or the deemed value amount is remitted to the commercial fisher.
    
    (6) Any deemed value amount paid to the chief executive under this section in respect of fish, aquatic life, or seaweed taken in any fishing year shall cease to be held on trust and become the property of the Crown on the later of---
        
    *   (a) the close of the 15th day of the third month after the end of the fishing year; or
    
    *   (ab) 5 working days after the chief executive gives written notice to a commercial fisher under [section 76A(6)][137] of the chief executive's decision to grant or refuse catch balancing relief; or
    
    *   (b) 5 working days after the final determination of any request for a review by a commercial fisher of a notification under [section 80][148].
    
    (7) Notwithstanding [section 69][928] of the Public Finance Act 1989, no interest is payable in respect of any amount that is held on trust under this section, whether remitted to any commercial fisher or not.

    (3) The chief executive may grant an applicant catch balancing relief for any specific amount of annual catch entitlement that is equal to or less than the amount for which the applicant applied.
    
    (4) The chief executive may grant catch balancing relief for a specific amount of annual catch entitlement only if he or she is satisfied that---
        
    *   (a) the applicant has received written notice from the chief executive that, at the close of registration, the applicant's reported catch for the stock for the fishing year exceeded the applicant's annual catch entitlement for the stock for the fishing year by at least the specific amount; and
    
    *   (b) at the close of registration, the original owner owned at least the specific amount of annual catch entitlement; and
    
    *   (c) either---

    *   (a) recalculate the annual deemed value amount (if any) for which the applicant is liable, by performing the comparison and calculations referred to in [section 76(1B) and (2A)][136] as if the applicant had owned the specific amount of annual catch entitlement at the close of registration; and
    
    *   (b) include in the written notice given to the applicant under [section 76A(6)][137] notice of the annual deemed value amount, recalculated under paragraph (a), for which the applicant is liable; and

    *   (a) the effectiveness of deemed values in encouraging commercial fishers to acquire or maintain sufficient annual catch entitlement to cover their total catch; and
    
    *   (b) the particular need, in relation to target stocks, to encourage commercial fishers to acquire or maintain sufficient annual catch entitlement to cover their total catch; and
    
    *   (c) actual or potential risks to the sustainability of the stock; and
    
    *   (d) any other matters that the Minister considers relevant.
    
    Section 77A: inserted, on 1 August 2001, by [section 28(1)][935] of the Fisheries Act 1996 Amendment Act 1999 (1999 No 101).

##### 78 Catch in excess of over-fishing thresholds
    
*   (1) This section applies where, following the calculation referred to in [section 76(1A)][136],---
        
    *   (a) a commercial fisher's reported catch for a stock exceeds the commercial fisher's annual catch entitlement for the stock; and
    
    *   (b) that excess is equal to or greater than the over-fishing threshold for the stock, and, where a tolerance level applies to the stock, is greater than that tolerance level.
    
    (2) In such a case the current fishing permit of the commercial fisher and of any person included with the commercial fisher under subsection (11), and also any permit subsequently issued to the commercial fisher or included person, are each to be treated as containing a condition prohibiting the taking of any fish, aquatic life, or seaweed in the geographic area that is the quota management area for the stock concerned.
    
    (3) The condition takes effect as from the close of the month in which the calculation referred to in [section 76(1A)][136] is done.
    
    (4) The chief executive must---
        
    *   (a) notify the imposition of the condition under subsection (2) to the commercial fisher concerned and any included person of whom the chief executive is aware; and
    
    *   (b) record on the Permit Register details of the imposition of the condition,---
    
    but any delay or failure to give that notification or make that record does not affect the imposition of the condition.
    
    (5) A commercial fisher who has requested a review under [section 80(2)][148] or lodged an appeal under section 80(6) may, pending determination of the review or appeal, apply to a District Court for an order removing or amending a condition imposed under this section, and the court may make such an order subject to such sureties and conditions as the court may specify.
    
    (6) Despite subsection (2), the chief executive may---
        
    *   (a) approve the taking of fish, aquatic life, or seaweed in an area by a person who would otherwise be subject to the condition imposed by subsection (2); and
    
    *   (b) impose as part of the approval any conditions that he or she considers necessary to reduce the risk of the person taking the stock for which the over-fishing threshold was exceeded.
    
    (7) Conditions imposed under subsection (6) may relate to stocks, area, quantities, methods, the use or non-use of vessels, the specific vessel or types of vessels that may be used, and types and amounts of fishing gear, or otherwise.
    
    (8) No person may take any fish, aquatic life, or seaweed in contravention of a condition imposed by subsection (2) unless---
        
    *   (a) the person has obtained the prior approval of the chief executive to take fish, aquatic life, or seaweed in that area; and
    
    *   (b) the taking is in accordance with any conditions imposed by the chief executive.
    
    (9) Conditions imposed by subsection (2) or under subsection (6) cease to apply---
        
    *   (a) when the commercial fisher referred to in subsection (1) owns an amount of annual catch entitlement for the stock equal to or greater than the commercial fisher's total reported catch of that stock in the fishing year; or
    
    *   (b) at the close of the relevant fishing year,---
    
    whichever happens first.
    
    (10) If a person takes any fish, aquatic life, or seaweed in contravention of any conditions imposed by subsection (2) or under subsection (6), the person commits an offence and is liable to the penalty set out in [section 252(3)][475].
    
    (11) For the purposes of subsection (2), a person or entity is to be treated as a person included with the commercial fisher if the person or entity is---
        
    *   (a) a subsidiary of the commercial fisher within the meaning of [section 5][936] of the Companies Act 1993; or
    
    *   (b) a company of which the commercial fisher is a subsidiary within the meaning of [section 5][936] of the Companies Act 1993; or
    
    *   (c) a partnership or unincorporated joint venture that would be a subsidiary of the commercial fisher, or of which the commercial fisher would be a subsidiary, if the partnership or joint venture were incorporated as a company with shareholdings corresponding to the interests, including returns, of the partners in the partnership or participants in the joint venture.
    
    (12) Despite subsection (11)---
        
    *   (a) Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Limited, a mandated iwi organisation, or members of an iwi, are not to be regarded as being included with any other person, whether or not that person is a mandated iwi organisation, merely because any of them has the status of being---
            
        *   (i) a beneficiary or income shareholder of Aotearoa Fisheries Limited; or
        
        *   (ii) a beneficiary of---
                
            *   (A) Te Putea Whakatupu Trust; or
            
            *   (B) Te Wai Maori Trust; or
            
            *   (C) Te Ohu Kai Moana; and
            
            
        
        
    
    *   (ab) Aotearoa Fisheries Limited is not to be regarded as being included with any other person merely because the other person holds, or benefits from, income shares in Aotearoa Fisheries Limited; and
    
    *   (b) no person is regarded as being included with another person merely because either or both of those persons would be included with Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Limited but for paragraph (a); and
    
    *   (c) no bank registered under the [Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1989][899] is to be regarded as being included with any other person merely because the bank has, in the ordinary course of its business as a financier, been granted any interest in quota owned by that person.

##### 78A Other persons may be subjected to same conditions as commercial fisher with catch in excess
    
*   (1) Where a fishing permit of a person (_person A_) is treated as being subject to a condition under [section 78(2)][141], the chief executive may impose the same condition on any fishing permit held by or subsequently issued to another person (_person B_) if the chief executive believes, on reasonable grounds specified on oath in writing, that---
        
    *   (a) person B is, in respect of commercial fishing, in substance person A; or
    
    *   (b) person B has, in substance, control of the commercial fishing of person A that led to the condition being imposed under [section 78(2)][141]; or
    
    *   (c) person B is allowing person A to conduct commercial fishing under person B's permit for the purpose of assisting person A to fish despite the condition treated as being contained in person A's permit.
    
    (2) Without limiting subsection (1), in forming the belief referred to in that subsection, the chief executive may have regard to the following matters:
        
    *   (a) shareholdings in, debentures over, or directorships of, any company that has an interest (whether direct or indirect) in person B or person A:

    *   (c) family, domestic, and business relationships between---

        *   (ii) persons having an interest in person B or person A or in companies or trusts of the kind referred to in paragraph (a) or paragraph (b):
        
        
    
    *   (d) whether person B is accustomed to following the instructions of person A:
    
    *   (e) whether person B is accustomed to acting in a manner consistent with advancing the interests of person A.
    
    (3) Whether any of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of subsection (1) apply may be determined without regard to the form of the persons or entities comprising persons A and B.
    
    (4) The chief executive must---
        
    *   (a) give notice to person B of the condition imposed under subsection (1) and a copy of the grounds for imposing the condition as given on oath; and
    
    *   (b) record on the Permit Register details of the imposition of the condition.
    
    (5) Any condition imposed under subsection (1) takes effect from the date of notification.
    
    (6) Subsections (6), (7), (8), and (10) of [section 78][141] apply to person B and person B's fishing permit as if the condition had been imposed on person B under subsection (2) of that section (and conditions imposed on person B under this section or section 78(6)(b) are not affected by decisions under section 78(6) in relation to person A).
    
    (7) Any conditions imposed on person B under this section or [section 78(6)][141] cease to apply---
        
    *   (a) when the commercial fisher referred to in [section 78(1)][141] complies with section 78(9)(a); or
    
    *   (b) at the close of the relevant fishing year,---
    
    whichever happens first.
    
    (8) If---
        
    *   (a) a person (**person B**) is, in respect of commercial fishing, in substance the same person as a person (**person A**) who has had a condition imposed on their fishing permit by [section 78(2)][141]; and
    
    *   (b) person B, knowing that the condition exists, conducts commercial fishing that would be a breach of the condition imposed on person A's fishing permit,---
    
    then each of person A and person B commits an offence and is liable to the penalty set out in [section 252(3)][475].
    
    (9) If a person (**person B**) knowingly allows another person (**person A**) to conduct commercial fishing under person B's permit for the purpose of assisting person A to fish despite the condition treated by [section 78(2)][141] as being contained in person A's permit, and person A does so, then each of person A and person B commits an offence and is liable to the penalty set out in [section 252(3)][475].

*   (1) A person who has had a condition imposed on his or her fishing permit under [section 78(2)][141] in their capacity as a person included with a commercial fisher under section 78(11), or a person who has had a condition imposed under [section 78A(1)][142], may apply to a District Court to have the condition removed either permanently or pending final determination of the application on the grounds that the situation relied upon under section 78(2) and (11) or section 78A(1) never existed or no longer exists.
    
    (2) In determining an application under subsection (1) totally or partially in favour of the applicant, the District Court may remove or amend the condition either totally or partially and on such sureties or conditions as the court considers appropriate.

##### 79 Suspension of permit for non-payment of deemed value
    
*   (1) If the total amount of deemed values owed by any commercial fisher exceeds $1,000 and has not been satisfied within the time limit specified in [section 76(5)][136], the current fishing permit of the commercial fisher and any person included with the commercial fisher under subsection (5), and any permit subsequently issued to the commercial fisher or included person, are, on the expiration of that time limit, to be treated as being suspended until the total amount of all outstanding deemed values owed by the commercial fisher is $1,000 or less.
    
    (2) The chief executive must---
        
    *   (a) notify every suspension or cessation of suspension of a fishing permit under subsection (1) to the commercial fisher concerned and any included person of whom the chief executive is aware; and
    
    *   (b) record on the Permit Register details of any suspension or cessation of suspension of a fishing permit under subsection (1);---
    
    but any delay or failure to give that notification or make that record does not affect the suspension or cessation.
    
    (3) A fishing permit suspended under this section does not authorise any person to take any fish, aquatic life, or seaweed under the authority of that permit, but all other provisions of this Act continue to apply as if the fishing permit had not been suspended.
    
    (4) A commercial fisher who has requested a review under [section 80(2)][148] or lodged an appeal under section 80(6) may, pending determination of the review or appeal, apply to a District Court for an order lifting any suspension imposed under this section, and the court may make such an order subject to such sureties and conditions as the court may specify.
    
    (5) For the purposes of subsections (1) and (2), a person or entity is to be treated as a person included with the commercial fisher if the person or entity is---

    *   (b) a company of which the commercial fisher is a subsidiary within the meaning of [section 5][936] of the Companies Act 1993; or
    
    *   (c) a partnership or unincorporated joint venture that would be a subsidiary of the commercial fisher, or of which the commercial fisher would be a subsidiary, if the partnership or joint venture were incorporated as a company with shareholdings corresponding to the interests, including returns, of the partners in the partnership or participants in the joint venture.
    
    (6) Despite subsection (5)---
        
    *   (a) Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Limited, a mandated iwi organisation, or members of an iwi are not to be regarded as being included with another person (whether or not that person is a mandated iwi organisation), merely because any of them is---
            
        *   (i) a beneficiary or income shareholder of Aotearoa Fisheries Limited; or
        
        *   (ii) a beneficiary of---

##### 79A Suspension of fishing permit of other persons
    
*   (1) Where a fishing permit of a person (**person A**) is suspended under [section 79(1)][144], the chief executive may suspend the fishing permit of another person (**person B**) if the chief executive believes, on reasonable grounds specified on oath in writing, that---

## Part 5  
Foreign licensed access

##### 81 Calculation of foreign allowable catch
    
*   (1) The Minister shall from time to time determine---
        
    *   (a) the portion of the total allowable commercial catch for a quota management stock that may be taken within the exclusive economic zone; and
    
    *   (b) the portion of the total catch limit (if any) for any stock not subject to the quota management system (including any highly migratory stock) that may be taken within the exclusive economic zone; and
    
    *   (c) the foreign allowable catch for a stock in the exclusive economic zone.
    
    (2) The foreign allowable catch for any quota management stock shall be the lesser of---
        
    *   (a) the portion of the total allowable commercial catch for the time being determined for the stock under subsection (1)(a):
    
    *   (b) the Crown's available annual catch entitlement for the stock.
    
    (3) For the purposes of subsection (2)(b), the Crown's available annual catch entitlement for a stock is the Crown's holding of annual catch entitlement for the stock that---
        
    *   (a) is generated from unencumbered quota held by the Crown; and
    
    *   (b) remains unsold after the Crown has offered the annual catch entitlement for sale to persons entitled to own quota.
    
    (4) The foreign allowable catch for any stock not subject to the quota management system shall be the lesser of---
        
    *   (a) the portion of the total catch limit (if any) for the time being determined under subsection (1)(b):
    
    *   (b) a catch that is sustainable after taking into account the total catch limit (if any) for, and the domestic harvesting capacity of, the stock.
    
    (5) For the purposes of this section, the term _domestic harvesting capacity_, in relation to any stock not subject to the quota management system, means the total domestic commercial catch reported as having been taken in the previous fishing year for the stock by New Zealand fishing vessels within New Zealand fisheries waters, with an appropriate adjustment to allow for---
        
    *   (a) any changes in the harvesting capacity of the domestic commercial fishing fleet due to---
            
        *   (i) recent investment in fishing vessels and fishing equipment; and
        
        *   (ii) catch trends; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) non-commercial take and scientific take.
    
    (6) If the foreign allowable catch for any quota management stock has been determined under subsection (1)(c) in accordance with subsection (2), the Minister shall set aside an amount of the Crown's holding of annual catch entitlement for the stock that is equivalent to the amount of the foreign allowable catch, and such annual catch entitlement shall not be used for fishing.
    
    (7) Nothing in this section applies in relation to any highly migratory species.

##### 82 Apportionment of foreign allowable catch for foreign fishing vessels
    
*   (1) The Minister may from time to time apportion, among countries other than New Zealand, the foreign allowable catch in respect of any stock (other than any highly migratory species) within the exclusive economic zone.
    
    (2) In making an apportionment under subsection (1), the Minister shall have regard to---
        
    *   (a) the degree to which fishing vessels of countries other than New Zealand have engaged in fishing within the exclusive economic zone; and
    
    *   (b) the degree to which such countries have co-operated with New Zealand in fisheries research and in the identification of fish stocks within the exclusive economic zone; and
    
    *   (c) the degree to which such countries have co-operated with New Zealand in the conservation and management of fisheries resources within the exclusive economic zone, and in the enforcement of New Zealand law relating to such resources; and
    
    *   (d) the degree to which such countries have complied with any relevant international obligations; and

    *   (g) procedures or requirements, or both, enabling the verification of fish, aquatic life, or seaweed taken or being taken by the vessel, including procedures or restrictions relating to the species of, quantities of, or areas from which, fish, aquatic life, or seaweed are being or have been taken by the vessel:
    
    *   (h) entry by the vessel to New Zealand ports, whether for the inspection of its catch or for other purposes:

    *   (b) a mortgagee's power of sale over any quota shares is not exercisable if the quota is subject to a Crown caveat under [section 58][108] or [section 61][113] or [section 214][429]:
    
    *   (c) the restrictions on a mortgagee's power of sale defined in [section 140A][268].

##### 140 Restriction on exercise of power of sale
    
*   (1) No power conferred by any mortgage to sell any quota shares shall, subject to [section 141][269], become or be deemed to have become exercisable because of---

    *   (b) any default in the performance or observance of any other covenant expressed or implied in the mortgage,---
    
    unless and until the mortgagee serves on the mortgagor a notice that complies with the requirements of this section, and (in any case if the default complained of is capable of remedy) the mortgagor fails to remedy the default before the date stated in the notice.
    
    (2) Every notice under subsection (1) shall inform the mortgagor of---
        
    *   (a) the nature and extent of the default complained of; and
    
    *   (b) the date by which the mortgagor is required to remedy the default (if it is capable of remedy); and
    
    *   (c) the rights that the mortgagee will be entitled to exercise if the default is not remedied within the stated period.
    
    (3) Any notice given under subsection (1) that does not comply with subsection (2) shall be void unless the failure does not materially prejudice the interests of the mortgagor.
    
    (4) The date to be stated in the notice shall be not earlier than 1 month from the service of the notice.

    (5A) In addition to giving the notice under subsection (1), if any of the quota shares are subject to a settlement quota interest registered under [section 152A][283], the mortgagee must, after serving notice on the quota owner, immediately serve a copy of the notice on Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Limited; however, failure to comply with this subsection does not in itself prevent money secured by a mortgage from being payable, or being deemed to have become payable.
    
    (6) For the purposes of subsection (1), the entering into of a contract to sell or the granting of an option to purchase quota shares shall not be regarded as the exercise of a power of sale if the contract or option is conditional (either solely or together with other conditions) on the failure by the owner to remedy a default specified in a notice under this section served either before or after the contract is entered into or the option is granted, as the case may be.
    
    (7) A mortgagee who exercises a power of sale of quota shares owes a duty to the mortgagor to take reasonable care to obtain the best price reasonably obtainable as at the time of sale.
    
    (8) Notwithstanding any enactment or rule of law or anything contained in any deed or instrument by or under which the power of sale is conferred,---
        
    *   (a) it is not a defence to proceedings against a mortgagee for a breach of the duty imposed by subsection (7) that the mortgagee was acting as the mortgagor's agent or under a power of attorney from the mortgagor:
    
    *   (b) a mortgagee is not entitled to compensation or indemnity from the mortgaged quota shares or the mortgagor in respect of any liability incurred by the mortgagee arising from a breach of the duty imposed by subsection (7).

    *   (a) order that the caveat be removed entirely:
    
    *   (b) order that the caveat be removed in part or in respect of any particular transaction:

*   The chief executive must register a settlement quota interest against the quota shares notified by Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Limited as soon as reasonably practicable after receiving---
        
    *   (a) a request in accordance with [section 160(2)][1052] of the Maori Fisheries Act 2004; and
    
    *   (b) payment by Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Limited of the prescribed fee.
    
    Section 152A: inserted, on 29 November 2004, by [section 214][763] of the Maori Fisheries Act 2004 (2004 No 78).

##### 152B Effect of registering settlement quota interest against quota shares
    
*   (1) Between the appointed day and the time when a settlement quota interest is registered against the quota specified by Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Limited, there must be no dealings with the quota shares listed in [Schedule 1][1053] of the Maori Fisheries Act 2004, except for their transfer to Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Limited.
    
    (2) While there is a settlement quota interest registered against quota, no transfer of that quota may be registered unless---
        
    *   (a) the transfer is---
            
        *   (i) authorised by Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Limited and the owner under [section 160][1052] of the Maori Fisheries Act 2004; or
        
        *   (ii) ordered by the court; or
        
        
    
    *   (b) the settlement quota is forfeit to the Crown under [section 61][113] or [sections 255 to 255E][478].
    
    (3) To avoid doubt, a settlement quota interest remains in force if settlement quota is transferred, unless the settlement quota interest is removed in accordance with [section 160][1052] of the Maori Fisheries Act 2004\.
    
    (4) However, the fact that a settlement quota interest is registered against the quota does not exclude the quota from being subject to a mortgage or caveat under this Act.
    
    (5) Subsection (2) overrides [section 145(1)][273].

#### Effect of decrease in or cancellation of quota

##### 153 Effect of decrease in quota shares
    
*   (1) This section applies where---
        
    *   (a) either---
            
        *   (i) a transfer of quota shares in any stock to any person holding preferential allocation rights under [section 23][37] necessitates a deduction of quota shares under that section from any quota owner; or
        
        *   (ii) any determination of an appeal under [section 51][89] necessitates a deduction of quota shares under [section 52][90] from any quota owner (other than the quota owner involved in the appeal); and
        
        
    
    *   (b) as a result of the deduction, the number of quota shares in that stock held by the owner is less than the total number of quota shares in that stock subject to a mortgage or caveat immediately before the deduction.
    
    (2) Where a deduction referred to in subsection (1)(a)(i) is required and there are 1 or more mortgages or caveats registered over the quota shares owned by the quota owner, then the number of shares secured by any 1 or more of those mortgages or caveats must be reduced in the manner prescribed by regulations made under this Act in accordance with the quota share reduction principles set out in subsection (4).
    
    (3) If any quota owner, or the chief executive, has appealed under [section 51][89] in relation to any stock, then, when the appeal is finally determined,---
        
    *   (a) all provisional individual transferable quota for the relevant stock owned by that quota owner must, at the chief executive's direction, be transferred to the Crown in accordance with [section 52][90]; and
    
    *   (b) if any provisional individual transferable quota shares so transferred were subject to a mortgage or caveat, the mortgage or caveat ceases to apply to the transferred provisional individual transferable quota shares, and instead applies to the same number of individual transferable quota shares transferred to that quota owner under [section 52][90] (if possible); and
    
    *   (c) if, as a result of such transfers, the number of individual transferable quota shares in the relevant stock owned by the quota owner is less than the number of provisional individual transferable quota shares that were subject to the mortgage or caveat and there are 1 or more mortgages or caveats registered over the provisional individual transferable quota shares owned by the quota owner, then the number of shares secured by any 1 or more of those mortgages or caveats must be reduced in the manner prescribed by regulations made under this Act in accordance with the quota share reduction principles set out in subsection (4).
    
    (4) The quota share reduction principles referred to in subsections (2) and (3)(c) are as follows:
        
    *   (a) the total number of shares subject to any individual caveat may not exceed the total number of shares owned by the quota owner concerned:
    
    *   (b) the total number of shares subject to all caveats may exceed the total number of shares owned by the quota owner:
    
    *   (c) where quota shares subject to caveats must be reduced, they must be reduced to equal the number of shares owned by the quota owner:
    
    *   (d) the total number of shares subject to all mortgages may not exceed the total number of shares owned by the quota owner concerned:
    
    *   (e) the total number of shares subject to all mortgages and caveats that were registered prior to the last registered mortgage may not exceed the total number of shares owned by the quota owner:
    
    *   (f) where quota shares subject to mortgages must be reduced, the shares subject to the most recently registered mortgage must be reduced first, and the shares subject to any earlier registered mortgage may only be reduced after the first-mentioned mortgage has had its security eliminated completely by the reduction.
    
    (5) The chief executive must make on the register any entry necessary to show that the quota has been transferred in accordance with [section 23][37] or [section 52][90], and alter any relevant mortgage or caveat accordingly.

##### 154 Effect of alteration of quota management area
    
*   (1) If 1 or more quota management areas are altered under [section 25][40],---
        
    *   (a) any mortgage or caveat over any quota that is cancelled as a result of the alteration shall cease to apply to the cancelled quota and shall instead apply to the new quota allocated to the quota owner concerned as a result of that alteration; and
    
    *   (b) the number of new quota shares to be charged or caveated shall bear the same proportion to the quota owner's total shareholding of those shares as the number of shares charged or caveated immediately before the alteration bore to the quota owner's total shareholding for the areas affected by the alteration.
    
    (2) The chief executive shall make on the register any entry necessary to show that the quota has been transferred in accordance with [section 26][43], and alter any relevant mortgage or caveat accordingly.
    
    (3) Subject to subsections (1) and (2), an alteration of 1 or more quota management areas does not affect any rights under a caveat or mortgage of quota shares.

    (6) No quota owned by any bank registered under the [Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1989][899] is to be regarded as associated quota merely because the bank has in the ordinary course of its business as a financier become the owner of that quota.

*   (1) If any property, fish, aquatic life, seaweed, or quota is forfeited to the Crown under this Act, such property, fish, aquatic life, seaweed, or quota, despite [section 168][305], vests in the Crown absolutely and free of all encumbrances.
    
    (1A) Despite subsection (1), if settlement quota is forfeit to the Crown under this Act, the quota continues to be subject to a settlement quota interest.
    
    (2) For the avoidance of doubt, any vessel used by the offender to take or transport fish, aquatic life, or seaweed must be treated as property used in the commission of the offence if the fish, aquatic life, or seaweed is the subject of an offence against---
        
    *   (a) [section 230][450] or [section 231][451]; or
    
    *   (b) regulations made under [section 297][580] or [section 298][581] or [section 299][582], which regulations relate to---
            
        *   (i) making any false or misleading statements in any return; or
        
        *   (ii) omitting any information in any return; or
        
        *   (iii) completing, keeping, or providing any return.
        
        
    
    (3) At the time of conviction of any offence against this Act, the court must determine what, if any, of the following is forfeit under any of [sections 255A to 255D][479]:
        
    *   (a) fish and any proceeds from the sale of such fish:
    
    *   (b) illegal fishing gear:
    
    *   (c) property used in the commission of the offence:
    
    *   (d) quota:
    
    *   (e) associated quota, unless the court is satisfied that subsection (3B) applies to preclude forfeiture.
    
    (3A) Where the court is considering the forfeiture of any quota alleged to be associated quota, the court must give any person who owns that quota a reasonable opportunity to make submissions and be heard on the questions of whether---
        
    *   (a) the quota is associated quota; and
    
    *   (b) if so, whether or not the court should find in favour of the owner under subsection (3B).
    
    (3B) Where the court is satisfied that associated quota exists, forfeiture must be considered in accordance with [sections 255C(3)][481] and [255D(2)][482] unless the court is satisfied that the associated quota is associated quota, rather than quota owned by the offender, for reasons principally other than avoiding the consequences of the application of this Act in respect of that forfeiture.
    
    (4) No person may be discharged without conviction in respect of an offence referred to in any of [sections 255A to 255D][479] unless the court for special reasons relating to the offence considers that the property, illegal fishing gear, fish, any proceeds from the sale of such fish, and quota should not be forfeit.
    
    (5) Nothing in any of [sections 255A to 255D][479] applies to any offence against a provision in [Part 15A][536].

In order to conserve and manage straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks, coastal States and States fishing on the high seas shall, in giving effect to their duty to cooperate in accordance with the Convention:
    
*   (a) adopt measures to ensure long-term sustainability of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks and promote the objective of their optimum utilization;

*   (b) ensure that such measures are based on the best scientific evidence available and are designed to maintain or restore stocks at levels capable of producing maximum sustainable yield, as qualified by relevant environmental and economic factors, including the special requirements of developing States, and taking into account fishing patterns, the interdependence of stocks and any generally recommended international minimum standards, whether subregional, regional or global;

*   (c) apply the precautionary approach in accordance with article 6;

*   (d) assess the impacts of fishing, other human activities and environmental factors on target stocks and species belonging to the same ecosystem or associated with or dependent upon the target stocks;

*   (e) adopt, where necessary, conservation and management measures for species belonging to the same ecosystem or associated with or dependent upon the target stocks, with a view to maintaining or restoring populations of such species above levels at which their reproduction may become seriously threatened;

*   (f) minimize pollution, waste, discards, catch by lost or abandoned gear, catch of non-target species, both fish and non-fish species, (hereinafter referred to as non-target species) and impacts on associated or dependent species, in particular endangered species, through measures including, to the extent practicable, the development and use of selective, environmentally safe and cost-effective fishing gear and techniques;

### Article 6---Application of the precautionary approach
    
*   1\. States shall apply the precautionary approach widely to conservation, management and exploitation of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks in order to protect the living marine resources and preserve the marine environment.

*   2\. States shall be more cautious when information is uncertain, unreliable or inadequate. The absence of adequate scientific information shall not be used as a reason for postponing or failing to take conservation and management measures.

*   3\. In implementing the precautionary approach, States shall:
        
    *   (a) improve decision-making for fishery resource conservation and management by obtaining and sharing the best scientific information available and implementing improved techniques for dealing with risk and uncertainty;
    
    *   (b) apply the guidelines set out in Annex II and determine, on the basis of the best scientific information available, stock-specific reference points and the action to be taken if they are exceeded;
    
    *   (c) take into account, inter alia, uncertainties relating to the size and productivity of the stocks, reference points, stock condition in relation to such reference points, levels and distribution of fishing mortality and the impact of fishing activities on non-target and associated or dependent species, as well as existing and predicted oceanic, environmental and socio-economic conditions; and
    
    *   (d) develop data collection and research programmes to assess the impact of fishing on non-target and associated or dependent species and their environment, and adopt plans which are necessary to ensure the conservation of such species and to protect habitats of special concern.
    
    

*   4\. States shall take measures to ensure that, when reference points are approached, they will not be exceeded. In the event that they are exceeded, States shall, without delay, take the action determined under paragraph 3(b) to restore the stocks.

*   5\. Where the status of target stocks or non-target or associated or dependent species is of concern, States shall subject such stocks and species to enhanced monitoring in order to review their status and the efficacy of conservation and management measures. They shall revise those measures regularly in the light of new information.

*   6\. For new or exploratory fisheries, States shall adopt as soon as possible cautious conservation and management measures, including, inter alia, catch limits and effort limits. Such measures shall remain in force until there are sufficient data to allow assessment of the impact of the fisheries on the long-term sustainability of the stocks, whereupon conservation and management measures based on that assessment shall be implemented. The latter measures shall, if appropriate, allow for the gradual development of the fisheries.

*   7\. If a natural phenomenon has a significant adverse impact on the status of straddling fish stocks or highly migratory fish stocks, States shall adopt conservation and management measures on an emergency basis to ensure that fishing activity does not exacerbate such adverse impact. States shall also adopt such measures on an emergency basis where fishing activity presents a serious threat to the sustainability of such stocks. Measures taken on an emergency basis shall be temporary and shall be based on the best scientific evidence available.

### Article 7---Compatibility of conservation and management measures
    
*   1\. Without prejudice to the sovereign rights of coastal States for the purpose of exploring and exploiting, conserving and managing the living marine resources within areas under national jurisdiction as provided for in the Convention, and the right of all States for their nationals to engage in fishing on the high seas in accordance with the Convention:
        
    *   (a) with respect to straddling fish stocks, the relevant coastal States and the States whose nationals fish for such stocks in the adjacent high seas area shall seek, either directly or through the appropriate mechanisms for cooperation provided for in Part III, to agree upon the measures necessary for the conservation of these stocks in the adjacent high seas area;
    
    *   (b) with respect to highly migratory fish stocks, the relevant coastal States and other States whose nationals fish for such stocks in the region shall cooperate, either directly or through the appropriate mechanisms for cooperation provided for in Part III, with a view to ensuring conservation and promoting the objective of optimum utilization of such stocks throughout the region, both within and beyond the areas under national jurisdiction.
    
    

*   2\. Conservation and management measures established for the high seas and those adopted for areas under national jurisdiction shall be compatible in order to ensure conservation and management of the straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks in their entirety. To this end, coastal States and States fishing on the high seas have a duty to cooperate for the purpose of achieving compatible measures in respect of such stocks. In determining compatible conservation and management measures, States shall:
        
    *   (a) take into account the conservation and management measures adopted and applied in accordance with article 61 of the Convention in respect of the same stocks by coastal States within areas under national jurisdiction and ensure that measures established in respect of such stocks for the high seas do not undermine the effectiveness of such measures;
    
    *   (b) take into account previously agreed measures established and applied for the high seas in accordance with the Convention in respect of the same stocks by relevant coastal States and States fishing on the high seas;
    
    *   (c) take into account previously agreed measures established and applied in accordance with the Convention in respect of the same stocks by a subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement;

States shall enter into consultations in good faith and without delay, particularly where there is evidence that the straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks concerned may be under threat of over-exploitation or where a new fishery is being developed for such stocks. To this end, consultations may be initiated at the request of any interested State with a view to establishing appropriate arrangements to ensure conservation and management of the stocks. Pending agreement on such arrangements, States shall observe the provisions of this Agreement and shall act in good faith and with due regard to the rights, interests and duties of other States.

*   3\. Where a subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement has the competence to establish conservation and management measures for particular straddling fish stocks or highly migratory fish stocks, States fishing for the stocks on the high seas and relevant coastal States shall give effect to their duty to cooperate by becoming members of such organization or participants in such arrangement, or by agreeing to apply the conservation and management measures established by such organization or arrangement. States having a real interest in the fisheries concerned may become members of such organization or participants in such arrangement. The terms of participation in such organization or arrangement shall not preclude such States from membership or participation; nor shall they be applied in a manner which discriminates against any State or group of States having a real interest in the fisheries concerned.

*   4\. Only those States which are members of such an organization or participants in such an arrangement, or which agree to apply the conservation and management measures established by such organization or arrangement, shall have access to the fishery resources to which those measures apply.

*   5\. Where there is no subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement to establish conservation and management measures for a particular straddling fish stock or highly migratory fish stock, relevant coastal States and States fishing on the high seas for such stock in the subregion or region shall cooperate to establish such an organization or enter into other appropriate arrangements to ensure conservation and management for such stock and shall participate in the work of the organization or arrangement.

*   6\. Any State intending to propose that action be taken by an intergovernmental organization having competence with respect to living resources should, where such action would have a significant effect on conservation and management measures already established by a competent subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement, consult through that organization or arrangement with its members or participants. To the extent practicable, such consultation should take place prior to the submission of the proposal to the intergovernmental organization.

Consistent with Part XIII of the Convention, States shall cooperate, either directly or through competent international organizations, to strengthen scientific research capacity in the field of fisheries and promote scientific research related to the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks for the benefit of all. To this end, a State or the competent international organization conducting such research beyond areas under national jurisdiction shall actively promote the publication and dissemination to any interested States of the results of that research and information relating to its objectives and methods and, to the extent practicable, shall facilitate the participation of scientists from those States in such research.

### Article 15---Enclosed and semi-enclosed seas

In implementing this Agreement in an enclosed or semi-enclosed sea, States shall take into account the natural characteristics of that sea and shall also act in a manner consistent with Part IX of the Convention and other relevant provisions thereof.

### Article 16---Areas of high seas surrounded entirely by an area under the national jurisdiction of a single State
    
*   1\. States fishing for straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks in an area of the high seas surrounded entirely by an area under the national jurisdiction of a single State and the latter State shall cooperate to establish conservation and management measures in respect of those stocks in the high seas area. Having regard to the natural characteristics of the area, States shall pay special attention to the establishment of compatible conservation and management measures for such stocks pursuant to article 7\. Measures taken in respect of the high seas shall take into account the rights, duties and interests of the coastal State under the Convention, shall be based on the best scientific evidence available and shall also take into account any conservation and management measures adopted and applied in respect of the same stocks in accordance with article 61 of the Convention by the coastal State in the area under national jurisdiction. States shall also agree on measures for monitoring, control, surveillance and enforcement to ensure compliance with the conservation and management measures in respect of the high seas.

*   2\. Pursuant to article 8, States shall act in good faith and make every effort to agree without delay on conservation and management measures to be applied in the carrying out of fishing operations in the area referred to in paragraph 1\. If, within a reasonable period of time, the fishing States concerned and the coastal State are unable to agree on such measures, they shall, having regard to paragraph 1, apply article 7, paragraphs 4, 5 and 6, relating to provisional arrangements or measures. Pending the establishment of such provisional arrangements or measures, the States concerned shall take measures in respect of vessels flying their flag in order that they not engage in fisheries which could undermine the stocks concerned.

## Part IV  
Non-members and non-participants

### Article 17---Non-members of organizations and non-participants in arrangements
    
*   1\. A State which is not a member of a subregional or regional fisheries management organization or is not a participant in a subregional or regional fisheries management arrangement, and which does not otherwise agree to apply the conservation and management measures established by such organization or arrangement, is not discharged from the obligation to cooperate, in accordance with the Convention and this Agreement, in the conservation and management of the relevant straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks.

## Part VI  
Compliance and enforcement

### Article 19---Compliance and enforcement by the flag State
    
*   1\. A State shall ensure compliance by vessels flying its flag with subregional and regional conservation and management measures for straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks. To this end, that State shall:
        
    *   (a) enforce such measures irrespective of where violations occur;
    
    *   (b) investigate immediately and fully any alleged violation of subregional or regional conservation and management measures, which may include the physical inspection of the vessels concerned, and report promptly to the State alleging the violation and the relevant subregional or regional organization or arrangement on the progress and outcome of the investigation;
    
    *   (c) require any vessel flying its flag to give information to the investigating authority regarding vessel position, catches, fishing gear, fishing operations and related activities in the area of an alleged violation;
    
    *   (d) if satisfied that sufficient evidence is available in respect of an alleged violation, refer the case to its authorities with a view to instituting proceedings without delay in accordance with its laws and, where appropriate, detain the vessel concerned; and
    
    *   (e) ensure that, where it has been established, in accordance with its laws, a vessel has been involved in the commission of a serious violation of such measures, the vessel does not engage in fishing operations on the high seas until such time as all outstanding sanctions imposed by the flag State in respect of the violation have been complied with.
    
    

*   2\. All investigations and judicial proceedings shall be carried out expeditiously. Sanctions applicable in respect of violations shall be adequate in severity to be effective in securing compliance and to discourage violations wherever they occur and shall deprive offenders of the benefits accruing from their illegal activities. Measures applicable in respect of masters and other officers of fishing vessels shall include provisions which may permit, inter alia, refusal, withdrawal or suspension of authorizations to serve as masters or officers on such vessels.

### Article 20---International cooperation in enforcement
    
*   1\. States shall cooperate, either directly or through subregional or regional fisheries management organizations or arrangements, to ensure compliance with and enforcement of subregional and regional conservation and management measures for straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks.

*   2\. A flag State conducting an investigation of an alleged violation of conservation and management measures for straddling fish stocks or highly migratory fish stocks may request the assistance of any other State whose cooperation may be useful in the conduct of that investigation. All States shall endeavour to meet reasonable requests made by a flag State in connection with such investigations.

*   3\. A flag State may undertake such investigations directly, in cooperation with other interested States or through the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement. Information on the progress and outcome of the investigations shall be provided to all States having an interest in, or affected by, the alleged violation.

*   4\. States shall assist each other in identifying vessels reported to have engaged in activities undermining the effectiveness of subregional, regional or global conservation and management measures.

*   5\. States shall, to the extent permitted by national laws and regulations, establish arrangements for making available to prosecuting authorities in other States evidence relating to alleged violations of such measures.

*   6\. Where there are reasonable grounds for believing that a vessel on the high seas has been engaged in unauthorized fishing within an area under the jurisdiction of a coastal State, the flag State of that vessel, at the request of the coastal State concerned, shall immediately and fully investigate the matter. The flag State shall cooperate with the coastal State in taking appropriate enforcement action in such cases and may authorize the relevant authorities of the coastal State to board and inspect the vessel on the high seas. This paragraph is without prejudice to article 111 of the Convention.

*   7\. States Parties which are members of a subregional or regional fisheries management organization or participants in a subregional or regional fisheries management arrangement may take action in accordance with international law, including through recourse to subregional or regional procedures established for this purpose, to deter vessels which have engaged in activities which undermine the effectiveness of or otherwise violate the conservation and management measures established by that organization or arrangement from fishing on the high seas in the subregion or region until such time as appropriate action is taken by the flag State.

### Article 21---Subregional and regional cooperation in enforcement
    
*   1\. In any high seas area covered by a subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement, a State Party which is a member of such organization or a participant in such arrangement may, through its duly authorized inspectors, board and inspect, in accordance with paragraph 2, fishing vessels flying the flag of another State Party to this Agreement, whether or not such State Party is also a member of the organization or a participant in the arrangement, for the purpose of ensuring compliance with conservation and management measures for straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks established by that organization or arrangement.

*   2\. States shall establish, through subregional or regional fisheries management organizations or arrangements, procedures for boarding and inspection pursuant to paragraph 1, as well as procedures to implement other provisions of this article. Such procedures shall be consistent with this article and the basic procedures set out in article 22 and shall not discriminate against non-members of the organization or non-participants in the arrangement. Boarding and inspection as well as any subsequent enforcement action shall be conducted in accordance with such procedures. States shall give due publicity to procedures established pursuant to this paragraph.

*   3\. If, within two years of the adoption of this Agreement, any organization or arrangement has not established such procedures, boarding and inspection pursuant to paragraph 1, as well as any subsequent enforcement action, shall, pending the establishment of such procedures, be conducted in accordance with this article and the basic procedures set out in article 22\.

*   4\. Prior to taking action under this article, inspecting States shall, either directly or through the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement, inform all States whose vessels fish on the high seas in the subregion or region of the form of identification issued to their duly authorized inspectors. The vessels used for boarding and inspection shall be clearly marked and identifiable as being on government service. At the time of becoming a Party to this Agreement, a State shall designate an appropriate authority to receive notifications pursuant to this article and shall give due publicity of such designation through the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement.

*   5\. Where, following a boarding and inspection, there are clear grounds for believing that a vessel has engaged in any activity contrary to the conservation and management measures referred to in paragraph 1, the inspecting State shall, where appropriate, secure evidence and shall promptly notify the flag State of the alleged violation.

*   6\. The flag State shall respond to the notification referred to in paragraph 5 within three working days of its receipt, or such other period as may be prescribed in procedures established in accordance with paragraph 2, and shall either:
        
    *   (a) fulfil, without delay, its obligations under article 19 to investigate and, if evidence so warrants, take enforcement action with respect to the vessel, in which case it shall promptly inform the inspecting State of the results of the investigation and of any enforcement action taken; or
    
    *   (b) authorize the inspecting State to investigate.
    
    

*   7\. Where the flag State authorizes the inspecting State to investigate an alleged violation, the inspecting State shall, without delay, communicate the results of that investigation to the flag State. The flag State shall, if evidence so warrants, fulfil its obligations to take enforcement action with respect to the vessel. Alternatively, the flag State may authorize the inspecting State to take such enforcement action as the flag State may specify with respect to the vessel, consistent with the rights and obligations of the flag State under this Agreement.

*   8\. Where, following boarding and inspection, there are clear grounds for believing that a vessel has committed a serious violation, and the flag State has either failed to respond or failed to take action as required under paragraphs 6 or 7, the inspectors may remain on board and secure evidence and may require the master to assist in further investigation including, where appropriate, by bringing the vessel without delay to the nearest appropriate port, or to such other port as may be specified in procedures established in accordance with paragraph 2\. The inspecting State shall immediately inform the flag State of the name of the port to which the vessel is to proceed. The inspecting State and the flag State and, as appropriate, the port State shall take all necessary steps to ensure the wellbeing of the crew regardless of their nationality.

*   9\. The inspecting State shall inform the flag State and the relevant organization or the participants in the relevant arrangement of the results of any further investigation.

*   10\. The inspecting State shall require its inspectors to observe generally accepted international regulations, procedures and practices relating to the safety of the vessel and the crew, minimize interference with fishing operations and, to the extent practicable, avoid action which would adversely affect the quality of the catch on board. The inspecting State shall ensure that boarding and inspection is not conducted in a manner that would constitute harassment of any fishing vessel.

*   11\. For the purposes of this article, a serious violation means:
        
    *   (a) fishing without a valid licence, authorization or permit issued by the flag State in accordance with article 18, paragraph 3(a);
    
    *   (b) failing to maintain accurate records of catch and catch-related data, as required by the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement, or serious misreporting of catch, contrary to the catch reporting requirements of such organization or arrangement;
    
    *   (c) fishing in a closed area, fishing during a closed season or fishing without, or after attainment of, a quota established by the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement;
    
    *   (d) directed fishing for a stock which is subject to a moratorium or for which fishing is prohibited;
    
    *   (e) using prohibited fishing gear;
    
    *   (f) falsifying or concealing the markings, identity or registration of a fishing vessel;
    
    *   (g) concealing, tampering with or disposing of evidence relating to an investigation;
    
    *   (h) multiple violations which together constitute a serious disregard of conservation and management measures; or
    
    *   (i) such other violations as may be specified in procedures established by the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement.
    
    

*   12\. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this article, the flag State may, at any time, take action to fulfil its obligations under article 19 with respect to an alleged violation. Where the vessel is under the direction of the inspecting State, the inspecting State shall, at the request of the flag State, release the vessel to the flag State along with full information on the progress and outcome of its investigation.

*   13\. This article is without prejudice to the right of the flag State to take any measures, including proceedings to impose penalties, according to its laws.

*   14\. This article applies mutatis mutandis to boarding and inspection by a State Party which is a member of a subregional or regional fisheries management organization or a participant in a subregional or regional fisheries management arrangement and which has clear grounds for believing that a fishing vessel flying the flag of another State Party has engaged in any activity contrary to relevant conservation and management measures referred to in paragraph 1 in the high seas area covered by such organization or arrangement, and such vessel has subsequently, during the same fishing trip, entered into an area under the national jurisdiction of the inspecting State.

*   15\. Where a subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement has established an alternative mechanism which effectively discharges the obligation under this Agreement of its members or participants to ensure compliance with the conservation and management measures established by the organization or arrangement, members of such organization or participants in such arrangement may agree to limit the application of paragraph 1 as between themselves in respect of the conservation and management measures which have been established in the relevant high seas area.

*   16\. Action taken by States other than the flag State in respect of vessels having engaged in activities contrary to subregional or regional conservation and management measures shall be proportionate to the seriousness of the violation.

*   17\. Where there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that a fishing vessel on the high seas is without nationality, a State may board and inspect the vessel. Where evidence so warrants, the State may take such action as may be appropriate in accordance with international law.

*   18\. States shall be liable for damage or loss attributable to them arising from action taken pursuant to this article when such action is unlawful or exceeds that reasonably required in the light of available information to implement the provisions of this article.

### Article 22---Basic procedures for boarding and inspection pursuant to article 21
    
*   1\. The inspecting State shall ensure that its duly authorized inspectors:
        
    *   (a) present credentials to the master of the vessel and produce a copy of the text of the relevant conservation and management measures or rules and regulations in force in the high seas area in question pursuant to those measures;
    
    *   (b) initiate notice to the flag State at the time of the boarding and inspection;
    
    *   (c) do not interfere with the master's ability to communicate with the authorities of the flag State during the boarding and inspection;
    
    *   (d) provide a copy of a report on the boarding and inspection to the master and to the authorities of the flag State, noting therein any objection or statement which the master wishes to have included in the report;
    
    *   (e) promptly leave the vessel following completion of the inspection if they find no evidence of a serious violation; and
    
    *   (f) avoid the use of force except when and to the degree necessary to ensure the safety of the inspectors and where the inspectors are obstructed in the execution of their duties. The degree of force used shall not exceed that reasonably required in the circumstances.
    
    

*   2\. The duly authorized inspectors of an inspecting State shall have the authority to inspect the vessel, its licence, gear, equipment, records, facilities, fish and fish products and any relevant documents necessary to verify compliance with the relevant conservation and management measures.

*   3\. The flag State shall ensure that vessel masters:
        
    *   (a) accept and facilitate prompt and safe boarding by the inspectors;
    
    *   (b) cooperate with and assist in the inspection of the vessel conducted pursuant to these procedures;
    
    *   (c) do not obstruct, intimidate or interfere with the inspectors in the performance of their duties;
    
    *   (d) allow the inspectors to communicate with the authorities of the flag State and the inspecting State during the boarding and inspection;
    
    *   (e) provide reasonable facilities, including, where appropriate, food and accommodation, to the inspectors; and
    
    *   (f) facilitate safe disembarkation by the inspectors.
    
    

*   4\. In the event that the master of a vessel refuses to accept boarding and inspection in accordance with this article and article 21, the flag State shall, except in circumstances where, in accordance with generally accepted international regulations, procedures and practices relating to safety at sea, it is necessary to delay the boarding and inspection, direct the master of the vessel to submit immediately to boarding and inspection and, if the master does not comply with such direction, shall suspend the vessel's authorization to fish and order the vessel to return immediately to port. The flag State shall advise the inspecting State of the action it has taken when the circumstances referred to in this paragraph arise.

### Article 23---Measures taken by a port State
    
*   1\.

## Annex I  
Standard requirements for the collection and sharing of data

#### Article 1---- General principles
    
*   1\. The timely collection, compilation and analysis of data are fundamental to the effective conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks. To this end, data from fisheries for these stocks on the high seas and those in areas under national jurisdiction are required and should be collected and compiled in such a way as to enable statistically meaningful analysis for the purposes of fishery resource conservation and management. These data include catch and fishing effort statistics and other fishery-related information, such as vessel-related and other data for standardizing fishing effort. Data collected should also include information on non-target and associated or dependent species. All data should be verified to ensure accuracy. Confidentiality of nonaggregated data shall be maintained. The dissemination of such data shall be subject to the terms on which they have been provided.

*   2\. Assistance, including training as well as financial and technical assistance, shall be provided to developing States in order to build capacity in the field of conservation and management of living marine resources. Assistance should focus on enhancing capacity to implement data collection and verification, observer programmes, data analysis and research projects supporting stock assessments. The fullest possible involvement of developing State scientists and managers in conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks should be promoted.

#### Article 2--- Principles of data collection, compilation and exchange

The following general principles should be considered in defining the parameters for collection, compilation and exchange of data from fishing operations for straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks:
    
*   (a) States should ensure that data are collected from vessels flying their flag on fishing activities according to the operational characteristics of each fishing method (e.g., each individual tow for trawl, each set for long-line and purse-seine, each school fished for pole-and-line and each day fished for troll) and in sufficient detail to facilitate effective stock assessment;

*   (b) States should ensure that fishery data are verified through an appropriate system;

*   (c) States should compile fishery-related and other supporting scientific data and provide them in an agreed format and in a timely manner to the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement where one exists. Otherwise, States should cooperate to exchange data either directly or through such other cooperative mechanisms as may be agreed among them;

*   (d) States should agree, within the framework of subregional or regional fisheries management organizations or arrangements, or otherwise, on the specification of data and the format in which they are to be provided, in accordance with this Annex and taking into account the nature of the stocks and the fisheries for those stocks in the region. Such organizations or arrangements should request non-members or non-participants to provide data concerning relevant fishing activities by vessels flying their flag;

*   (e) such organizations or arrangements shall compile data and make them available in a timely manner and in an agreed format to all interested States under the terms and conditions established by the organization or arrangement; and

*   (f) scientists of the flag State and from the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement should analyse the data separately or jointly, as appropriate.

#### Article 3--- Basic fishery data
    
*   1\. States shall collect and make available to the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement the following types of data in sufficient detail to facilitate effective stock assessment in accordance with agreed procedures:
        
    *   (a) time series of catch and effort statistics by fishery and fleet;
    
    *   (b) total catch in number, nominal weight, or both, by species (both target and non-target) as is appropriate to each fishery. \[Nominal weight is defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations as the live-weight equivalent of the landings\];
    
    *   (c) discard statistics, including estimates where necessary, reported as a number or nominal weight by species, as is appropriate to each fishery;
    
    *   (d) effort statistics appropriate to each fishing method; and
    
    *   (e) fishing location, date and time fished and other statistics on fishing operations as appropriate.
    
    

*   2\. States shall also collect where appropriate and provide to the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement information to support stock assessment, including:
        
    *   (a) composition of the catch according to length, weight and sex;
    
    *   (b) other biological information supporting stock assessments, such as information on age, growth, recruitment, distribution and stock identity; and
    
    *   (c) other relevant research, including surveys of abundance, biomass surveys, hydro-acoustic surveys, research on environmental factors affecting stock abundance, and oceanographic and ecological studies.
    
    

#### Article 4--- Vessel data and information
    
*   1\. States should collect the following types of vessel-related data for standardizing fleet composition and vessel fishing power and for converting between different measures of effort in the analysis of catch and effort data:
        
    *   (a) vessel identification, flag and port of registry;
    
    *   (b) vessel type;
    
    *   (c) vessel specifications (e.g., material of construction, date built, registered length, gross registered tonnage, power of main engines, hold capacity and catch storage methods); and
    
    *   (d) fishing gear description (e.g., types, gear specifications and quantity).
    
    

*   2\. The flag State will collect the following information:
        
    *   (a) navigation and position fixing aids;
    
    *   (b) communication equipment and international radio call sign; and
    
    *   (c) crew size.
    
    

#### Article 5--- Reporting

A State shall ensure that vessels flying its flag send to its national fisheries administration and, where agreed, to the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement, logbook data on catch and effort, including data on fishing operations on the high seas, at sufficiently frequent intervals to meet national requirements and regional and international obligations. Such data shall be transmitted, where necessary, by radio, telex, facsimile or satellite transmission or by other means.

#### Article 6--- Data verification

States or, as appropriate, subregional or regional fisheries management organizations or arrangements should establish mechanisms for verifying fishery data, such as:
    
*   (a) position verification through vessel monitoring systems;

*   (b) scientific observer programmes to monitor catch, effort, catch composition (target and non-target) and other details of fishing operations;

*   (c) vessel trip, landing and transshipment reports; and

*   (d) port sampling.

#### Article 7--- Data exchange
    
*   1\. Data collected by flag States must be shared with other flag States and relevant coastal States through appropriate subregional or regional fisheries management organizations or arrangements. Such organizations or arrangements shall compile data and make them available in a timely manner and in an agreed format to all interested States under the terms and conditions established by the organization or arrangement, while maintaining confidentiality of non-aggregated data, and should, to the extent feasible, develop database systems which provide efficient access to data.

*   2\. At the global level, collection and dissemination of data should be effected through the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Where a subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement does not exist, that organization may also do the same at the subregional or regional level by arrangement with the States concerned.

## Annex II  
Guidelines for the application of precautionary reference points in conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks

*   1\. A precautionary reference point is an estimated value derived through an agreed scientific procedure, which corresponds to the state of the resource and of the fishery, and which can be used as a guide for fisheries management.

*   2\. Two types of precautionary reference points should be used: conservation, or limit, reference points and management, or target, reference points. Limit reference points set boundaries which are intended to constrain harvesting within safe biological limits within which the stocks can produce maximum sustainable yield. Target reference points are intended to meet management objectives.

*   3\. Precautionary reference points should be stock-specific to account, inter alia, for the reproductive capacity, the resilience of each stock and the characteristics of fisheries exploiting the stock, as well as other sources of mortality and major sources of uncertainty.

*   4\. Management strategies shall seek to maintain or restore populations of harvested stocks, and where necessary associated or dependent species, at levels consistent with previously agreed precautionary reference points. Such reference points shall be used to trigger pre-agreed conservation and management action. Management strategies shall include measures which can be implemented when precautionary reference points are approached.

*   5\. Fishery management strategies shall ensure that the risk of exceeding limit reference points is very low. If a stock falls below a limit reference point or is at risk of falling below such a reference point, conservation and management action should be initiated to facilitate stock recovery. Fishery management strategies shall ensure that target reference points are not exceeded on average.

*   6\. When information for determining reference points for a fishery is poor or absent, provisional reference points shall be set. Provisional reference points may be established by analogy to similar and better-known stocks. In such situations, the fishery shall be subject to enhanced monitoring so as to enable revision of provisional reference points as improved information becomes available.

*   7\. The fishing mortality rate which generates maximum sustainable yield should be regarded as a minimum standard for limit reference points. For stocks which are not overfished, fishery management strategies shall ensure that fishing mortality does not exceed that which corresponds to maximum sustainable yield, and that the biomass does not fall below a predefined threshold. For overfished stocks, the biomass which would produce maximum sustainable yield can serve as a rebuilding target.

*   This is a reprint of the Fisheries Act 1996\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 28 June 2013, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][1521] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][1522] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][1523] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][1524] and [17E][1525] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
