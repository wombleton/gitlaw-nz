##### 20 Difference between wholesale and retail price of motor spirits to be refunded in certain cases
    
*   Whereas the prices at which motor spirits may be sold are fixed by certain regulations (hereinafter in this section referred to as the **district regulations**) made under the Motor-spirits (Regulation of Prices) Act 1933:
    
    And whereas by the district regulations it is provided that where any purchaser of motor spirits purchases or has purchased for use in his own business and not for resale not less than specified quantities of motor spirits the motor spirits shall be sold at reduced prices (hereinafter in this section referred to as **wholesale prices**):
    
    And whereas in the month of September 1939 restrictions were imposed on the quantities of motor spirits that could be purchased, and consequently purchasers of motor spirits who would otherwise have purchased the specified quantities of motor spirits which would have entitled them to purchase at wholesale prices were unable to purchase those quantities:
    
    And whereas the district regulations have since been amended by reducing the quantities specified but the amendment did not come into force until 8 March 1940:
    
    And whereas it is desirable to provide that persons who, if the amendment had come into force on 1 September 1939 and applied with respect to all motor spirits purchased on or after that date, would have been entitled to pay wholesale prices for any motor spirits, instead of the higher prices actually paid by them, should be entitled to a refund of any moneys paid in excess of the wholesale prices:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    (1) If any person has bought motor spirits for use in his own business and not for resale and satisfies the Minister of Industries and Commerce that if the aforesaid amendment of the district regulations, being the Motor-spirits Prices General Regulations 1938, Amendment No 8 (SR 1940/42), had come into force on 1 September 1939 and had applied with respect to all motor spirits purchased on or after that date, that person would have been entitled to purchase the motor spirits at the wholesale prices for the time being in force, the vendor of the motor spirits shall refund to that person any amount paid for the motor spirits in excess of those wholesale prices.
    
    (2) Any vendor of motor spirits liable to make a refund under this section shall make the refund not later than 16 days after he receives notice that the Minister has been so satisfied as aforesaid.
    
    (3) Any such notice may be signed on behalf of the Minister by any officer of the Industries and Commerce, Tourist and Publicity Department.

##### 21 Extending powers of Dilworth trustees as to British children
    
*   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the will of James Dilworth, late of Remuera, Auckland, settler (deceased), or in the [Drillers Trustees Act 1902][32], or in the Dilworth Trustees Act 1902 Amendment Act 1905, or in the Dilworth Trustees Acts Amendment Act 1912, the trustees of the said will may select to be a pupil of the Dilworth Ulster Institute any boy who, during any war in which His Majesty may be engaged and whether before or after the passing of this Act, may have arrived in New Zealand from any part of the United Kingdom under any Government scheme, whether or not he is under the age of 10 years.

##### 22 Administration by Public Trustee of a certain trust under the will of Thomas Edmund Smith
    
*   \[Repealed\]
    
    Section 22: repealed, on 1 March 2002, by [section 170(1)][33] of the Public Trust Act 2001 (2001 No 100).

##### 23 Validating grant of scholarships by Porirua College Trust Board and by Papawai and Kaikokirikiri Trusts Board

*   This is a reprint of the Finance Act (No 2) 1940\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 March 2002, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][36] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][37] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][38] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][39] and [17E][40] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
