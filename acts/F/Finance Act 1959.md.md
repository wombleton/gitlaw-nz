##### 5 Empowering certain local authorities to expend money in connection with Westland centennial celebrations
    
*   It shall be lawful and be deemed to have been lawful for any local authority or public body whose district lies wholly or partly within the boundaries of any of the Counties of Westland, Grey, and Inangahua to expend money out of its general fund or account towards celebrating and commemorating the 100th anniversary of the settlement of Westland, and in connection with the establishment of a centennial memorial or centennial memorials, and to make grants to the body known as the Westland Centennial Council for any such purpose.

##### 6 Authorising certain expenditure by Survey Board
    
*   Notwithstanding anything in section 5 of the Surveyors Act 1938 or in any other Act, the Survey Board is hereby authorised to pay the sum of 500 pounds out of its funds to Archibald Hugh BogIe, Esquire, a member of the Board, for his services as Secretary of the Board for the period commencing on 1 December 1958 and ending with 15 July 1959 and it is hereby declared that the receipt of that sum shall not disqualify him from membership of the Board.

##### 7 Public Trustee to administer funds of Institute for Care of Backward Children Incorporated
    
*   Whereas the Institute for the Care of Backward Children Incorporated (in this section referred to as the _Institute_) raised funds (in this section referred to as the _funds_) partly by means of subscriptions from members but principally by means of grants from art unions and charitable trusts and by donations from the public for the purpose of erecting in Auckland a hostel for backward children; but the funds are insufficient to enable the Institute to carry out that purpose:
    
    And whereas the Institute desires that the funds should be applied as soon as practicable in or towards some purpose in connection with any home, school, or institution for intellectually handicapped children established by the Department of Health in or near the City of Auckland, and that the funds shall be held in trust in the meantime:
    
    And whereas the Institute has no power under its rules to dispose of the funds in that manner.
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    (1) The Institute shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act pay and transfer the funds to the Public Trustee, whose receipt therefor shall be a sufficient discharge to the Institute.
    
    (2) The funds shall upon payment or transfer to the Public Trustee be invested in and form part of the Common Fund of the Public Trust Office, and bear interest accordingly.
    
    (3) Notwithstanding anything in any Act or rule of law, until the funds are disbursed by the Public Trustee in the manner hereinafter provided all interest arising therefrom shall be accumulated and added to the capital thereof.
    
    (4) Upon the establishment by the Department of Health of a home, school, or institution for intellectually handicapped children in or near the City of Auckland, the Public Trustee shall, as soon as may be thereafter, apply the funds and the accumulations of income in or towards the provision, as part of that home, school, or institution, or as an adjunct thereof, or otherwise in connection therewith, of a building, structure, or other work or amenity that will contribute towards the physical, mental, or recreational welfare of the children for the time being in or attending the home, school, or institution or will otherwise be for their benefit, and in a manner that as far as may be practicable will enable the building, structure, work, or amenity to possess such distinctive features or characteristics as will identify it with and commemorate the source from which the funds came.

*   \[Repealed\]
    
    Section 8: repealed, on 1 April 1967, by section 41(1) of the Consumer Council Act 1966 (1966 No 21).

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Finance Act 1959\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 February 1982, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][12] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][13] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][14] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][15] and [17E][16] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
