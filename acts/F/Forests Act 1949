### Subpart 2---Cost recovery
    
*   Subpart 2: inserted, on 14 November 2006, by [section 31(4)][175] of the Climate Change Response Amendment Act 2006 (2006 No 59).

##### 67ZH Principles of cost recovery
    
*   (1) The Minister must take all reasonable steps to ensure that the direct and indirect costs of administering this Part that are not provided for by money appropriated by Parliament for the purpose are recovered under this subpart, whether by way of fees, levies, or otherwise.
    
    (2) In determining the most appropriate method of cost recovery under [section 67ZI][137], the Minister must have regard, as far as is reasonably practicable, to the following criteria:
        
    *   (a) equity, in that funding for a particular function, power, or service, or a particular class of functions, powers, or services, should generally, and to the extent practicable, be sourced from the users or beneficiaries of the relevant function, power, or service at a level commensurate with their use or benefit from the function, power, or service:
    
    *   (b) efficiency, in that costs should generally be allocated and recovered in order to ensure that maximum benefits are delivered at minimum cost:
    
    *   (c) justifiability, in that costs should be collected only to meet the actual and reasonable costs (including indirect costs) for the provision or exercise of the relevant function, power, or service:
    
    *   (d) transparency, in that costs should be identified and allocated as closely as practicable in relation to tangible service provision for the recovery period in which the service is provided.
    
    (3) Costs should not be recovered under this subpart unless there has been appropriate consultation with affected persons or representatives of persons substantially affected.
    
    (4) Nothing in subsection (3) requires consultation in relation to specific fees or charges, or the specific levels of fees or charges, so long as the fees or charges set are reasonably within the purview of any general consultation; and a failure to comply with subsection (3) does not affect the validity of any regulations made for the purposes of this subpart.
    
    (5) Nothing in this section requires a strict apportionment of the costs to be recovered for a particular function or service based on usage; and, without limiting the way in which fees or charges may be set, a fee or charge may be set at a level or in a way that---
        
    *   (a) is determined by calculations that involve an averaging of costs or potential costs:
    
    *   (b) takes into account costs or potential costs of services that are not directly to be provided to the person who pays the fee or charge but which are an indirect or potential cost arising from the delivery of the service in question to a class of persons or all persons who use the service.

##### 67ZI Methods of cost recovery
    
*   The methods by which costs may be recovered under this subpart are as follows:
        
    *   (a) fixed fees or charges:
    
    *   (b) fees or charges based on a scale or formula or at a rate determined on an hourly or other unit basis:
    
    *   (c) use of a formula or other method of calculation for fixing fees and charges:
    
    *   (d) the recovery by way of fee or charge of actual and reasonable costs expended in, or associated with, the performance of a service or function:
    
    *   (e) estimated fees or charges, or fees or charges based on estimated costs, paid before the provision of the service or function, followed by reconciliation and an appropriate further payment or refund after provision of the service or function:
    
    *   (f) levies:
    
    *   (g) any combination of the above.

    *   (b) except as the regulations may otherwise provide, apply in that year and all subsequent years until revoked or replaced.
    
    (2) Subsection (1) does not prevent the alteration or setting during any financial year of a fee, charge, or levy payable in that year if either---
        
    *   (a) the fee, charge, or levy is reduced, removed, or restated without substantive alteration; or
    
    *   (b) in the case of an increase or a new fee, charge, or levy,---
            
        *   (i) appropriate consultation has been carried out with persons or representatives of persons substantially affected by the alteration or setting; and
        
        *   (ii) the Minister is satisfied that those persons, or their representatives, agree or do not substantially disagree with the alteration or setting.
        
        
    
    (3) Subsection (1) does not prevent the amendment of any regulation setting a fee, charge, or levy if any substantive alteration effected by the amendment is for the purpose of correcting an error.
    
    (4) Recovery may be made in any financial year of any shortfall in cost recovery for any of the preceding 4 financial years, and allowance may be made for any over-recovery of costs in those years (including any estimated shortfall or over-recovery for the immediately preceding financial year).

    (2) A review may make provision for recovery in any relevant financial year of any shortfall in cost recovery for any of the preceding 4 financial years, or make allowance for any over-recovery of costs in those years (including any estimated shortfall or over-recovery for the immediately preceding financial year).
    
    (3) To avoid doubt, all areas of cost recovery need not be reviewed at the same time, nor is there any time limit on the making of regulations to implement the results of a review.

*   The plan shall specify---
        
    *   (a) the names and species of indigenous timber and tree ferns that are proposed to be removed from the indigenous forest land; and
    
    *   (b) details of the proposed volume of timber to be harvested; and

##### 10 Sustainable forest management prescriptions
    
*   (1) The principal sustainable forest management prescription is that the rate of harvest from a forest or group of forests managed as a unit shall be limited to a level at which the forest can continue to supply an annual or periodic non-diminishing yield in perpetuity, which yield shall include the harvest of windthrown or dead trees as they become available.
    
    (2) The other sustainable management prescriptions are as follows:
        
    *   (a) an area that is representative of the forest area and does not exceed 20% of the total forest area to which the plan relates may be set aside and be unavailable for logging:
    
    *   (b) podocarp and kauri species shall be harvested only by single tree or small group harvesting using low impact techniques. Harvesting shall, as far as possible, be restricted to the selective removal of trees predisposed to windthrow or early death. Throughout the term of the sustainable management plan, the character and structure of all parts of the forest shall be maintained:
    
    *   (c) beech and other light-demanding hardwood species shall be harvested only in coupes of 0.5 hectares or less:
    
    *   (d) shade-tolerant and exposure-sensitive broadleaved hardwood species shall be harvested only by single tree or small group harvesting using low impact techniques. In creating gaps, regard shall be had for natural regeneration characteristics of the species targeted for logging:
    
    *   (e) where any podocarp, kauri, or shade-tolerant or exposure-sensitive broadleaved hardwood species is harvested and sufficient advanced growth is lacking, there shall be planted for each tree removed at least 5 nursery-raised seedlings of at least 60 centimetres in height of the same species which seedlings shall, where practicable, be raised from seed collected from the district in which such seedlings are to be planted:
    
    *   (f) where there is a failure of regeneration in a light-demanding hardwood forest, the failure shall be corrected by the planting of nursery-raised seedlings with preference being given to using seedlings of the same species which seedlings shall, where practicable, be raised from seed collected from the district in which the seedlings are to be planted.
    
    (3) Before harvesting any coupe within a distance from a harvested coupe equal to the width of the harvested coupe, regeneration on the harvested coupe must---
        
    *   (a) have reached a predominant mean height of 4 metres; and
    
    *   (b) have reached a stocking of the harvested species equal to or greater than the forest before harvesting.
    
    Schedule 2 clause 10(2)(e): amended, on 2 September 1996, by section 4 of the Forests Amendment Act (No 2) 1996 (1996 No 124).

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Forests Act 1949\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 October 2012, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][272] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][273] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][274] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][275] and [17E][276] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
