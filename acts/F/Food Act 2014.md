*   (1) The purpose of this section is to recognise the general equivalence of food safety regimes under this Act and the [Animal Products Act 1999][578] and the [Wine Act 2003][579] in terms of their ability to ensure the safety and suitability of any food to which they apply.
    
    (2) This section achieves its purpose by---
        
    *   (a) clarifying the relationship between this Act and the [Animal Products Act 1999][578] and the [Wine Act 2003][579] by acknowledging that, in addition to this Act, the Animal Products Act 1999 and the Wine Act 2003 contain measures that manage the safety and suitability of any animal product or wine that is food within the meaning of this Act; and
    
    *   (b) minimising any overlap between the food safety regime under this Act and the food safety regimes under the [Animal Products Act 1999][578] and the [Wine Act 2003][579].
    
    (3) This Act applies to---
        
    *   (a) an animal product that is processed under the [Animal Products Act 1999][578] (whether the animal product is for sale on the domestic market or is to be exported), if that animal product is also a food; and
    
    *   (b) wine that is made under the [Wine Act 2003][579] (whether the wine is for sale on the domestic market or is to be exported), because wine is a food as defined in this Act.
    
    (4) Subsection (3) is subject to exemptions that may be granted under this Act and, in particular, under---
        
    *   (a) [sections 343][429] and [344][430] (which allow any food or classes or descriptions of food, persons who trade in food, or operations or places in relation to any trade in food to be exempted from the application of all or any requirements of this Act):

    *   (c) [sections 349][437] and [350][438] (which allow certain persons covered by the [Animal Products Act 1999][578] or the [Wine Act 2003][579] to be exempted from the requirement to operate under an applicable risk-based measure).
    
    (5) The following provisions apply to manage any overlap between the food safety regime under this Act and the food safety regimes under the [Animal Products Act 1999][578] and the [Wine Act 2003][579]:
        
    *   (a) [section 27][44] (which allows winemakers to apply for their winemaking operations to be included in a registered food control plan or a national programme); and
    
    *   (b) [sections 32 to 34][580] of the Animal Products Act 1999 (which provide for the relationship between the food safety regime under this Act and risk management programmes under the Animal Products Act 1999 by recognising the general equivalence of food control plans and risk management programmes); and
    
    *   (c) sections 15A to 15C of the Wine Act 2003 (which provide for the relationship between the food safety regime under this Act and wine standards management plans).
    
    (6) If there is any conflict, duplication, or inconsistency between the requirements of this Act and the requirements of the [Animal Products Act 1999][578] or the [Wine Act 2003][579] in relation to an animal product or wine, the requirements of those other Acts prevail.
    
    (7) If there is any conflict, duplication, or inconsistency between a power or other form of authority conferred by or under the [Animal Products Act 1999][578] or the [Wine Act 2003][579] and a power or other form of authority conferred by or under this Act, the power or other form of authority conferred by or under those other Acts applies instead of the power or other form of authority conferred by or under this Act.

Risk-based measures

### Subpart 1---General

#### Preliminary

##### 20 Overview of this Part
    
*   (1) This Part contains provisions relating to risk-based measures, which are the main means under this Act for ensuring food businesses achieve safe and suitable food. 
    
    (2) This Part---
        
    *   (a) classifies food sectors into 3 risk classes based on, among other things, the level of risk that their activities pose to public health and assigns a risk-based measure to food businesses in a class where appropriate; and
    
    *   (b) provides, in [Schedule 1][570], a description of food sectors that are generally subject to a food control plan; and
    
    *   (c) categorises national programmes into 3 levels based on, among other things, the risks involved and provides, in [Schedule 2][571], a description of food sectors that are generally subject, in descending order of risk, to a level 3, level 2, or level 1 national programme; and
    
    *   (d) provides, in [Schedule 3][572], a description of food sectors that are not required to operate under a food control plan or a national programme; and
    
    *   (e) specifies which risk-based measure generally applies if a food sector is not specified in any of [Schedules 1 to 3][570] or if a food sector is described in more than 1 of those schedules; and
    
    *   (f) requires a person who trades in food and whose food business is in a food sector to which a risk-based measure applies to operate the food business under that risk-based measure, unless the person is exempted from that requirement under the provisions of this Part; and

#### Classification of food sectors

##### 21 Classification of food sectors for purpose of assigning applicable risk-based measures
    
*   (1) The classification of food sectors under this Part---
        
    *   (a) is based on, among other things, the level of risk that their activities pose to public health in terms of the safety and suitability of food; and

        *   (ii) the place where the relevant operations are carried out; or

    *   (a) must, as soon as practicable, give written notice of the cancellation to---

### Subpart 3---National programmes

#### Preliminary

##### 73 Purpose of this subpart
    
*   The purpose of this subpart is to set out provisions about the nature, content, and effect of a national programme.

#### National programmes

##### 74 National programme: general description
    
*   (1) A national programme is a programme designed to identify, control, manage, and eliminate or minimise hazards or other relevant factors for the purpose of achieving safe and suitable food by---
        
    *   (a) imposing controls on a food business in relation to matters such as (without limitation) good operating practice, documentation requirements, verification requirements, and registration requirements; and
    
    *   (b) managing the relevant risks in a manner that ensures the level of control placed on food businesses in a food sector is, among other things, proportional to the level of risk that the food sector generally poses to public health.
    
    (2) A national programme must require every person or food business that is subject to it to comply with the applicable requirements of this Act.
    
    (3) A national programme may be 1 of the 3 levels specified in [section 21(3)(b)][37] and each of those levels may differ in the level of control or the set of requirements that it imposes, depending on how high or low the level is. 
    
    (4) Accordingly, a level 3 national programme generally imposes a higher level of control on a food business than a level 2 or level 1 national programme, and a level 2 national programme generally imposes a higher level of control than a level 1 national programme.

##### 75 How national programme may be imposed
    
*   (1) A national programme may be imposed by regulations made under [section 76][107] and, if required, supplemented by specifications set by the chief executive by notice under [section 405][512]. 
    
    (2) Any regulations or specifications referred to in subsection (1) may---
        
    *   (a) apply to particular food businesses or food sectors or to classes of food businesses or food sectors:
    
    *   (b) specify different requirements for different food businesses or food sectors or different classes of food businesses or food sectors:
    
    *   (c) make different provision for different food businesses or food sectors or classes of food businesses or food sectors.
    
    (3) To avoid doubt, [section 405(3)][512] applies if the chief executive issues a notice setting specifications for the purposes of subsection (1).
    
    Compare: 1999 No 93 [ss 38(2)][626], [39(3), (4)][627]

##### 76 Regulations about national programmes

    *   (b) prescribing verification requirements, including provisions that deal with the frequency, intensity, and cost of verification:
    
    *   (c) prescribing procedures and requirements for the registration of food businesses, including who the appropriate registration authority should be, the form and content of registration, and the fees and charges payable for registration (if any):
    
    *   (d) prescribing conditions, or restrictions on conditions, that may be imposed by the registration authority on the registration of a food business that is subject to a national programme:
    
    *   (e) prescribing the duration of the registration of a food business that is subject to a national programme:

    *   (g) prescribing requirements relating to the safety and suitability of food and to good operating practice:
    
    *   (h) requiring persons who operate under a national programme to demonstrate competency, in relation to the safety and suitability of food, food production, and food processing and handling, to undergo appropriate training, and to provide training for staff as appropriate:
    
    *   (i) requiring reports to be made in respect of breaches of a national programme:
    
    *   (j) requiring samples and tests to be carried out in relation to matters under a national programme and for the results of those tests to be reported to the chief executive:
    
    *   (k) prescribing any other matters that may be necessary to ensure that a national programme effectively minimises and manages risks to public health and protects and promotes public health:
    
    *   (l) prescribing any other matters that may be necessary for the purpose of giving effect to a national programme.
    
    (2) Before recommending the making of regulations under this section, the Minister must be satisfied that there has been appropriate consultation on the regulations in accordance with [section 379][478].
    
    Compare: 1999 No 93 [s 39(1)][627]

##### 77 National programme not invalid on certain grounds
    
*   A national programme may not be held invalid merely because it---
        
    *   (a) confers any discretion on, or allows any matter to be determined or approved by, the Minister, the chief executive, the registration authority, or any food safety officer; or
    
    *   (b) allows the Minister or the chief executive to impose specifications or other requirements as to the performance of any activities.
    
    Compare: 1999 No 93 [s 39(2)][627]

##### 78 Requirements of national programme to prevail in cases of inconsistency with other regulations or specifications made under this Act

### Subpart 4---Monitoring programmes

##### 100 Purpose of this subpart
    
*   The purpose of this subpart is to set out provisions about the nature, content, and effect of a monitoring programme.

##### 101 Monitoring programme: general description
    
*   (1) A monitoring programme is used to impose, in the circumstances described in subsection (2), monitoring measures and related activities that are necessary---
        
    *   (a) for determining the safety or suitability of food; or
    
    *   (b) for ensuring the effectiveness of the food safety regime; or
    
    *   (c) for enhancing, or determining the need for, adopted joint food standards, domestic food standards, or national outcomes; or
    
    *   (d) for determining regulatory performance against the objectives of minimising and managing the food risks in respect of public health.
    
    (2) The circumstances are as follows:
        
    *   (a) the monitoring measures and related activities need to be provided for on a sector or industry basis because food businesses in the sector or industry are not generally subject to the requirement to operate under a food control plan or a national programme; or
    
    *   (b) it is not feasible or practicable to provide for the monitoring measures and related activities by means of other risk-based measures.
    
    (3) A monitoring programme may be imposed on any food sector despite the fact that the sector is already subject to a risk-based measure.

##### 102 Monitoring programme: scope
    
*   A monitoring programme must specify its purpose, and may---
        
    *   (a) apply to all or any class or classes of importer, food, persons or business, process or operation, place, or area:
    
    *   (b) set out how monitoring will take place:

    (2) The matters referred to in subsection (1)(b) are---
        
    *   (a) the circumstances specified in [section 101(2)][138]; and
    
    *   (b) the particular circumstances of the person or group of persons that would make it unreasonable or impracticable for them to comply with the monitoring programme.
    
    (3) Before recommending the making of regulations under this section, the Minister must---
        
    *   (a) be satisfied that 1 or both of the circumstances specified in [section 101(2)][138] apply; and
    
    *   (b) be satisfied that the monitoring programme is a cost-effective way of providing for the monitoring measures and related activities; and
    
    *   (c) take into account the following matters:
            
        *   (i) the need to meet the purpose of this Act:
        
        *   (ii) the relative cost of having the monitoring programme or not having it, and who bears the cost:
        
        *   (iii) any other matters that the Minister considers relevant; and
        
        
    
    *   (d) be satisfied that there has been appropriate consultation on the regulations in accordance with [section 379][478].
    
    Compare: 1999 No 93 [s 39(3), (4)][627]

##### 104 Chief executive may specify certain matters by notice

    (3) A notice referred to in subsection (1) or (2) must not be inconsistent with the regulations.

##### 105 Monitoring programme not invalid on certain grounds
    
*   A monitoring programme may not be held invalid merely because it---
        
    *   (a) confers any discretion on, or allows any matter to be determined or approved by, the Minister, the chief executive, or any food safety officer; or
    
    *   (b) allows the Minister or the chief executive to impose specifications or other requirements as to the performance of any activities.

## Part 3  
Food imported for purpose of sale

#### Preliminary

##### 106 Purpose of this Part
    
*   The purpose of this Part is---
        
    *   (a) to require the safety and suitability of food imported for the purpose of sale; and
    
    *   (b) to provide for the registration of certain importers of that food.
    
    

##### 107 Interpretation
    
*   In this Part, a reference to food imported for the purpose of sale includes a reference to food that---
        
    *   (a) is imported for processing and handling; and
    
    *   (b) is then subsequently exported.
    
    

##### 108 Restriction on importation of food for purpose of sale
    
*   (1) A person must not import any food for the purpose of sale unless---
        
    *   (a) the person is a registered importer; or
    
    *   (b) if the person is not a registered importer, the person is importing the food through an agent who is a registered importer.
    
    (2) The importation of food in a quantity that is more than that which a reasonable person would consider to be reasonably required for the purpose of personal consumption must, unless the contrary is proved, be treated as an importation of the food for the purpose of sale.

##### 109 Food clearance
    
*   (1) A food safety officer may give any imported food a clearance for entry into New Zealand if subsection (2) or (3) applies.
    
    (2) This subsection applies if all of the following apply:
        
    *   (a) the importer of the food---
            
        *   (i) is a registered importer; or 
        
        *   (ii) is acting through an agent who is a registered importer; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) any regulations made under [section 387][488] are complied with; and
    
    *   (c) any applicable notices issued under [section 405][512] are complied with; and
    
    *   (d) there are no discrepancies that suggest that it may be unwise for the food safety officer to rely on the documentation accompanying the food, either---
            
        *   (i) in the documentation itself; or
        
        *   (ii) between the documentation and the food.
        
        
    
    (3) This subsection applies if a food safety officer is satisfied (including, but not exclusively, by declaration by the importer) that the food is not imported for the purpose of sale.
    
    (4) A food safety officer may give a clearance for entry under this section---
        
    *   (a) unconditionally; or
    
    *   (b) subject to any conditions that the food safety officer thinks necessary or desirable to achieve the safety and suitability of food.
    
    (5) A clearance for entry given under this section does not affect the application of the provisions of any other Act.

    *   (a) in the agency's or person's capacity as a recognised agency or a recognised person; or

    *   (b) the agency or person is no longer a fit and proper person to carry out the agency's or person's specified functions and activities; or
    
    *   (c) the agency or person has failed to comply with [section 155 or 156][204] or any other applicable requirements of this Act, and that failure causes the chief executive to question the agency's or the person's ability to carry out the agency's or person's specified functions or activities; or

##### 198 Principles of cost recovery
    
*   (1) The Minister and the chief executive must take all reasonable steps to ensure that the direct and indirect costs of the Ministry in administering this Act that are not provided for by money that is funded by the Crown for the purpose are recovered under this subpart, whether by way of fees, levies, or otherwise.
    
    (2) In determining the most appropriate method of cost recovery under [section 199][262], the Minister and the chief executive must take into account, as far as is reasonably practicable, the following criteria:
        
    *   (a) equity, in that funding for a particular function, power, or service, or a particular class of function, power, or service, should generally, and to the extent practicable, be sourced from the users or beneficiaries of the relevant functions, powers, or services at a level commensurate with their use or benefit from the function, power, or service:
    
    *   (b) efficiency, in that costs should generally be allocated and recovered in order to ensure that maximum benefits are delivered at minimum cost:
    
    *   (c) justifiability, in that costs should be collected only to meet the actual and reasonable costs (including indirect costs) of the provision or exercise of the relevant function, power, or service:
    
    *   (d) transparency, in that costs should be identified and allocated as closely as practicable in relation to tangible service provision for the recovery period in which the service is provided.
    
    (3) Costs should not be recovered under this subpart unless---
        
    *   (a) there has been appropriate consultation with persons or organisations that the chief executive considers representative of the interests of persons likely to be substantially affected by the exercise of the power; and
    
    *   (b) the persons involved have been given sufficient time and information to make an informed contribution.
    
    (4) Subsection (3) does not require consultation in relation to specific fees or charges, or the specific levels of fees or charges, so long as the fees or charges set are reasonably within the scope of any general consultation or any consultation carried out for the purposes of [section 379][478] or [380][479].
    
    (5) A failure to comply with subsection (3) does not affect the validity of any regulations made for the purposes of this subpart.
    
    (6) This section does not require a strict apportionment of the costs to be recovered for a particular function or service based on usage.
    
    (7) Without limiting the way in which fees or charges may be set under this subpart, a fee or charge may be set at a level or in a way that---
        
    *   (a) is determined by calculations that involve an averaging of costs or potential costs:
    
    *   (b) takes into account costs or potential costs of services (that are not directly to be provided to the person who pays the fee or charge but which are an indirect or potential cost) arising from the delivery of the service to a class of persons or all persons who use the service.
    
    

##### 199 Methods of cost recovery
    
*   The methods by which costs may be recovered under this subpart are as follows:
        
    *   (a) fixed fees or charges:
    
    *   (b) fees or charges based on a scale or formula or at a rate determined on an hourly or other unit basis:
    
    *   (c) the recovery by way of fee or charge of actual and reasonable costs expended in or associated with the performance of a service or function:
    
    *   (d) estimated fees or charges, or fees or charges based on estimated costs, paid before the provision of the service or function, followed by reconciliation and an appropriate further payment or refund after provision of the service or function:
    
    *   (e) refundable or non-refundable deposits paid before provision of the service or performance of the function:
    
    *   (f) fees or charges imposed on users of services or on third parties:
    
    *   (g) levies:
    
    *   (h) any combination of the above.
    
    

##### 200 Territorial authority responsible for collection

        *   (i) the amount is prescribed by regulations made under this subpart; and
        
        *   (ii) the regulations provide for the territorial authority to be the collection agent; and
        
        *   (iii) the requirement to pay the amount in the particular case has not been waived or exempted under this subpart; and

    *   (c) must forward the amount collected (other than the costs of collection) to the Ministry.
    
    

##### 201 Cost recovery to relate generally to financial year
    
*   (1) Except as provided in subsection (2), any regulations under this subpart that set a fee, charge, or levy that applies in any financial year---

    *   (b) except as the regulations may otherwise provide, apply in that year and all subsequent years until revoked or replaced.
    
    (2) Subsection (1) does not prevent the alteration or setting during any financial year of a fee, charge, or levy payable in that year if---
        
    *   (a) the fee, charge, or levy is reduced or removed (or restated without substantive alteration); or
    
    *   (b) in the case of an increase or a new fee, charge, or levy,---
            
        *   (i) appropriate consultation has been carried out with persons or representatives of persons substantially affected by the alteration or setting; and
        
        *   (ii) the Minister is satisfied that those persons, or their representatives, agree or substantially agree with the alteration or setting.
        
        
    
    (3) Subsection (1) does not prevent the amendment of any regulations that set a fee, charge, or levy if any substantive alteration effected by the amendment is for the purpose of correcting an error.

### Subpart 7---Transitional provisions

#### Preliminary

##### 413 Overview of transitional provisions
    
*   (1) This section describes the general scheme and effect of the transitional provisions contained in this subpart. It is by way of explanation only and does not limit or affect the other provisions of this Act.
    
    (2) The [Food Act 1981][577] is repealed by [section 420][531]. _See_ that section and [section 2][1] for the staggered commencement of the repeal of different provisions of that Act.
    
    (3) However, despite the repeal of the [Food Act 1981][577], the [Food Hygiene Regulations 1974][722], the [Dietary Supplements Regulations 1985][723], and the [Food (Safety) Regulations 2002][724] continue in force until the end of this Act's introductory period, unless they are sooner revoked by regulations made under this Act.
    
    (4) Each food sector will have an authorised period to make the transition from the requirements of the [Food Act 1981][577] and the [Food Hygiene Regulations 1974][722] to the new requirements of this Act. That period will start on the relevant appointed date and end on a date that the Governor-General, by Order in Council, may specify by regulations made under this Act. The effect of allowing an authorised transition period for each food sector is intended to provide food businesses across the entire food industry with a staggered and orderly transition to the new requirements of this Act.
    
    (5) A food business that is subject to the [Food Hygiene Regulations 1974][722] immediately before the relevant appointed date may do any of the following during the authorised transition period for the food sector that the food business is in:
        
    *   (a) comply with the [Food Hygiene Regulations 1974][722]; or
    
    *   (b) choose to operate under the applicable risk-based measure for its food sector; or
    
    *   (c) choose to operate under a food control plan, if a food control plan is not the applicable risk-based measure for its food sector; or
    
    *   (d) choose not to operate under a food control plan or a national programme if the food business is wholly within 1 or more of the food sectors specified in [Schedule 3][572].
    
    (6) A food safety programme under the [Food Act 1981][577] that is current immediately before the relevant appointed date is deemed to be a food control plan under this Act. A food business to which the deemed food control plan relates or applies may operate under it until the end of the authorised transition period for the food sector that the food business is in. At the end of the authorised transition period, the food business must operate under the applicable risk-based measure for its food sector unless the food business is wholly within 1 or more of the food sectors specified in [Schedule 3][572]. Alternatively, it may choose to operate under a food control plan, if a food control plan is not the applicable risk-based measure for its food sector.
    
    (7) A food business that is not in existence immediately before the relevant appointed date and that only starts to operate on or after that date must operate under the applicable risk-based measure (if any) for its food sector. Alternatively, it may choose to operate under a food control plan, if a food control plan is not the applicable risk-based measure for its food sector.
    
    (8) On the close of 3 years after the relevant appointed date for subsection (4), this Act's introductory period ends, unless extended to a date up to 2 years later by regulations made under this Act. By the end of this Act's introductory period, every food business must be operating under the applicable risk-based measure (if any), unless an exemption under this Act applies to the food business.

The food control plans to which the food sectors in this schedule are subject may include all activities undertaken by the business that are listed in [Schedule 2][571] or [3][572]. If the food business chooses not to cover all the activities in their food control plan, then they must operate their business under a combination of risk-based measures as provided for in [section 25(2)(b)][42]. For example, transport can be covered under a national programme level 1 as described under the heading **Transporters or distributors of food products** in [Part 5][600] of Schedule 2\.
