##### 21 How samples to be dealt with

    *   (a) divide the sample into 3 parts; and
    
    *   (b) mark and seal or fasten up each part in such manner as its nature will permit; and
    
    *   (c) leave 1 part with the owner of the food from which the sample was taken or the person from whom the sample was procured.
    
    (2) When any food is contained in a package in such quantity that its division into 3 parts would, in the opinion of the officer, furnish parts insufficient for accurate analysis, additional packages that purport to contain a similar food under the same brand or label may be taken or procured, and the contents of 2 or more packages may be mixed together and the mixture divided and submitted for analysis as provided in this section.
    
    (3) If the officer who has procured the sample considers that it should be analysed, he shall submit 1 part of the sample to an analyst for this purpose and shall retain the third part.

    *   (a) a sample of food is procured only for bacteriological analysis; or
    
    *   (b) a sample of milk is procured only for examination by the freezing point test for added water; or
    
    *   (c) a sample of milk is procured for bacteriological analysis and examination by the freezing point test for added water,---
    
    the officer may submit the whole sample to the analyst instead of dividing it into parts, unless the owner of the food from which the sample was taken or the person from whom the sample was procured requires him to leave a part with such owner or person, in which case it shall be sufficient compliance with that requirement if the officer selects, marks, and seals 2 packages that purport to contain similar food under the same brand or label, as the case may require, and leaves 1 of them.
    
    (5) Subject to subsection (6), if the officer reasonably believes that the food of which he seeks to procure a sample is of such a nature or so packed that there is a risk of its quality being affected in the course and by reason of the procedure prescribed in subsection (1), or there is a danger of the portions not being representative of the bulk of the sample, the officer may submit the whole sample to the analyst instead of dividing it into 3 parts.
    
    (6) In any case to which subsection (5) applies, if the owner of the food or the person from whom the sample was procured so requires, the officer shall select, mark, and seal another package that purports to contain a similar food under the same brand or label, as the case may require, and leave it with that owner or person.

    (4) When any sample is procured by an officer under this Act and submitted for analysis, the person from whom the sample was procured, and the manufacturer or importer of the food, may, on payment of the prescribed fee, obtain a copy of the analyst's certificate or, if there is no such certificate, a copy of the report made by the analyst in respect of the sample.
    
    (5) \[Repealed\]
    
    (6) Every person commits an offence against this Act who publishes or causes to be published any advertisement relating to any food or appliance which states that the food or appliance has been analysed by an analyst under this Act, or quotes or purports to quote the findings of any analyst under this Act in relation to the food or appliance, whether or not those findings are given in any certificate or report prepared for the purposes of this Act.

    *   (b) the defendant does not, by notice in writing given to the prosecutor at least 7 clear days before the hearing, require the analyst to be called by the prosecutor as a witness at the hearing.
    
    (3) No certificate referred to in subsection (1) shall be admissible in evidence if the court, of its own motion, directs that the result of the analysis shall be disregarded unless that result is proved by the oral evidence of the analyst.
    
    (4) No certificate of an analyst and no other evidence of an analysis under this Act shall be ruled inadmissible or disregarded by reason only of the fact that any of the provisions of this Act or of any regulations or food standards made under this Act relating to the taking or analysing of samples have not been strictly complied with, if there has been reasonable compliance with those provisions.
