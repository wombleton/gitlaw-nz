##### 12 As to refunds to consumers of electricity in Gore of certain charges, and as to future charges
    
*   Whereas the Southland Electric Power Board (hereinafter called the **Board**) entered into an agreement (hereinafter referred to as the **agreement**) with the Gore Borough Council (hereinafter called the **Council**) on 30 March 1927 to purchase the Council's electric reticulation system and to supply electrical energy direct to the residents of the Borough of Gore upon the terms and conditions therein set out:
    
    And whereas the agreement contained a provision that, in the event of the Board agreeing with any other consumer of electrical energy for the supply thereof at a lower price than that payable under the scale set forth in the agreement, the Board would reduce the charges in respect of electrical energy to the consumers within the borough using a similar quantity of energy for similar purposes under reasonably like circumstances to the same rate as was being charged by the Board to such other consumer:
    
    And whereas the Board made deeds of agreement with the Mataura Borough Council, dated respectively 1 December 1932 and 27 April 1933, and it was contended that by reason of provisions in those deeds the Board was bound to reduce the prices for electrical energy used by consumers in the Borough of Gore:
    
    And whereas the Board and the Council agreed on 19 September 1936 to refer to an arbitrator the determination of certain questions arising between them:
    
    And whereas prior to the arbitration the Southland Electric Power District was abolished and the Board dissolved pursuant to the provisions of section 8 of the Southland Electric-power Supply Act 1936 and all the rights, liabilities, and engagements of the Board became the rights, liabilities, and engagements of the Crown:
    
    And whereas the arbitrator in the matter of the arbitration between the Council and the Minister (as successor to the Board) held that the Minister was bound for a term of 15 years commencing on 1 December 1932 or during such shorter term as the provisions of the Mataura contract might remain in force, not to charge any consumer in the Borough of Gore for any quantity of electrical energy used in the borough more than prices specified in the Mataura contract:
    
    And whereas there is still doubt as to the extent to which the Council is entitled to take advantage of the lower charges under the Mataura contract:
    
    And whereas it has been mutually agreed between the Council and the Minister that the Minister shall refund to the Gore Borough consumers three-fourths of the amounts computed to be due under the award:
    
    And whereas public notice was twice duly given in a newspaper circulating in the district to the Gore Borough consumers to make application for such refunds prior to 31 March 1939:
    
    And whereas certain refunds have already been made, and it is desirable to validate those refunds and to authorise further refunds to be made:
    
    And whereas consumers in the Borough of Gore have since 31 December 1937 been charged for electrical energy partly in accordance with the charges under the Mataura contract and partly in accordance with the Gore tariff, and it is desirable to preserve the rights of the present consumers:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    (1) Subject to the provisions of this section, the Minister shall, from moneys appropriated by Parliament for the purposes of the Electric Supply Account, refund an amount to be determined as hereinafter mentioned to every person who during the period beginning on 1 December 1932 and ending on 31 December 1937 was a consumer of electrical energy in the Borough of Gore and who is entitled to a refund under the said award and the agreement. All refunds made under this section shall be deemed to be expenditure upon working expenses of the South Island schemes.
    
    (2) The refunds made under this section shall be deemed to be in full settlement of all the liabilities of the Minister (as successor to the Board) to make refunds under the award and the agreement.
    
    (3) No refund shall be made under this section unless an application therefor by the consumer or any other person entitled to claim the refund was received at the office of the Minister at Invercargill or at Gore on or before 31 March 1939:
    
    provided that the Minister may make a refund under this section in respect of any claim received after that date if he is of opinion that there was good reason for omitting to make the claim on or before that date and that the claim has been made within a reasonable time after that date.
    
    (4) Any refund under this section may be made to the consumer or to any other person entitled to claim the refund. The determination of the Minister as to the amount of any refund and as to the person to whom it is to be made shall be final and conclusive.
    
    (5) In arriving at the amount of the refund to be paid to or in respect of any consumer, the Minister shall take into account the difference between the amount actually paid by the consumer during the period referred to in subsection (1) for electrical energy and the amount that the consumer would have paid had he made the payments on the basis set out in the award; and the amount of the refund shall be three-fourths of that difference.
    
    (6) All payments made by the Minister before the passing of this Act and purporting to be refunds of moneys due under the award and the agreement shall be as valid and effectual as if they had been made pursuant to this section, and accordingly shall, where necessary, be deemed to have been so made.
    
    (7) Any consumer of electrical energy in the Borough of Gore other than a new consumer as hereinafter defined may continue until 1 December 1947 to use and pay for electrical energy at the prices being paid by him at the passing of this Act---that is to say, partly at the rates fixed by the Gore tariff as modified by the deeds between the Board and the Mataura Borough Council hereinbefore referred to, and partly at the rates fixed by the Southland tariff in force on 23 February 1939\.
    
    (8) Any consumer of electrical energy in the Borough of Gore other than a new consumer may at any time after the passing of this Act elect to adopt in its entirety either the Southland tariff or the Gore tariff, and any consumer who elects to adopt the Gore tariff may subsequently elect to adopt the Southland tariff. If any such consumer does not elect to adopt the Gore tariff before 1 December 1947 he shall be deemed to have elected to adopt the Southland tariff.
    
    (9) Any new consumer may elect to adopt in its entirety either the Southland tariff or the Gore tariff, but it is hereby declared that no new consumer shall be entitled or be deemed to have at any time heretofore been entitled to select parts of the one tariff, and parts of the other tariff. Any new consumer who has elected or hereafter elects to adopt the Gore tariff may subsequently elect to adopt the Southland tariff.
    
    (10) When a consumer of electrical energy has elected or is deemed to have elected to adopt the Southland tariff under either of the last 2 preceding subsections he may not at any time thereafter change to the Gore tariff or, if he is not a new consumer, revert to the prices being paid by him at the passing of this Act.
    
    (11) In this section, unless the context otherwise requires,---
    
    _Gore tariff_ means the terms and conditions of retail supply of electrical energy and the retail prices and minimum charges for electrical energy in operation in the Borough of Gore on 29 March 1927
    
    _Minister_ means the Minister of Public Works
    
    _new consumer_ means a consumer of electrical energy in the Borough of Gore who was connected to the Minister's supply of electrical energy for the first time after 31 March 1939 and includes every consumer in so far as he is a consumer in respect of premises situated in the borough and connected to the Minister's supply for the first time after that date
    
    _Southland tariff_ means the terms and conditions of retail supply of electrical energy and the retail prices and minimum charges for electrical energy from time to time in operation under the Minister's Southland Electric Power Supply Scheme; but does not include any special terms and conditions, retail prices, or minimum charges which may be applicable in the Borough of Gore or in the Borough of Mataura, or which for any special reason may, after the passing of this Act, be made applicable to any other particular part of the Southland Electric Power District.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Finance Act (No 2) 1939\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 February 1982, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][61] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][62] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][63] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][64] and [17E][65] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
