    (8) Upon the making of any contract of fire insurance to which this section applies, the levy at the rate then declared, computed in respect of the period of the contract of fire insurance, shall thereupon become a debt due by the insurance company to the Commission.
    
    (9) The amount of the levy for which any insurance company at any time becomes liable under this section in respect of any contract of fire insurance shall thereupon become a debt due by the insured person to the insurance company, and may be recovered by the company accordingly.

    (11) Every insurance company shall, when forwarding any statement of account or demand for premium to any insured person in respect of any contract of insurance to which the levy applies, provide in that statement of account or demand that the levy is shown in a separate distinct and identifiable fashion from any premium payable to the insurance company or any other premium, tax, or levy paid to any other person or persons including the Crown, and it shall not be lawful for any insurance company to make any payment of brokerage, agency, or commission to any person or persons whatsoever in respect of the levy.

    (13) Without limiting the general power to make regulations conferred by [section 92][207], regulations may be made under that section for all or any of the following purposes:
        
    *   (a) providing for and regulating the collection, receipt, and payment of money under this section:
    
    *   (b) requiring insurance companies to make returns and keep books and accounts for the purposes of this section:
