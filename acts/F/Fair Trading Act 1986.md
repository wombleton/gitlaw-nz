##### 36K Meaning of uninvited direct sale agreement
    
*   (1) In this subpart, _uninvited direct sale agreement_ means an agreement for the supply, in trade, of goods or services to a consumer---
        
    *   (a) that is made as a result of negotiations (whether or not they are the only negotiations that precede the making of the agreement) between a supplier and the consumer in a situation described in either subsection (2) or (3); and
    
    *   (b) where the price paid or payable by the consumer under the agreement---
            
        *   (i) is more than $100; or
        
        *   (ii) cannot be ascertained at the time of supply (regardless of whether the price ultimately paid or payable is $100 or less).
        
        
    
    (2) The first situation is where the negotiations take place between the consumer and the supplier, in each other's presence, in the consumer's home or workplace, where the consumer did not invite the supplier to come to that place for the purposes of entering into negotiations relating to the supply of those goods or services (whether or not the consumer made such an invitation in relation to a different supply).
    
    (3) The other situation is where the negotiations take place by telephone, where the consumer did not invite the supplier to make the telephone call for the purposes of entering into negotiations relating to the supply of those goods or services (whether or not the consumer made such an invitation in relation to a different supply).
    
    (4) However, **uninvited direct sale agreement** does not include a renewal agreement.
    
    (5) For the purposes of this section, a consumer has not invited a supplier to---
        
    *   (a) come to the home or workplace, or to make a telephone call, merely because the consumer has---
            
        *   (i) given his or her name or contact details to the supplier other than for the predominant purpose of entering into negotiations relating to the supply of goods or services; or
        
        *   (ii) contacted the supplier in connection with an unsuccessful attempt by the supplier to contact the consumer:
        
        
    
    *   (b) enter into negotiations for a supply merely because the supplier has provided an unsolicited quote or estimate.
    
    (6) In subsection (4), **renewal agreement** means a new agreement that replaces an existing agreement between a supplier and consumer where---
        
    *   (a) the existing agreement---
            
        *   (i) involves the supply, in trade, of goods or services to the consumer by the supplier; and
        
        *   (ii) is in force at the time the negotiations for the new agreement occur; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) the new agreement involves the supply, in trade, of goods or services---
            
        *   (i) of the same, or of a similar, kind as those supplied under the existing agreement; and
        
        *   (ii) by the same supplier to the same consumer (being the parties to the existing agreement); and
        
        *   (iii) on the same, or similar, terms and conditions as those in the existing agreement.

        *   (i) at the time the agreement is entered into; or
        
        *   (ii) in the case of an agreement entered into over the telephone, within 5 working days after the date on which the agreement was entered into.
        
        
    
    (2) The requirements referred to in subsection (1)(a)(v) are that---
        
    *   (a) the following information is set out on the front page of the agreement:
            
        *   (i) a clear description of the goods or services to be supplied under the agreement; and

        *   (iii) the supplier's name, street address, telephone number, and email address; and
        
        *   (iv) the consumer's name and street address; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) either---
            
        *   (i) the total price payable, and any other consideration to be given, under the agreement is disclosed in the agreement; or
        
        *   (ii) if the total price or consideration is not ascertainable at the time at which the agreement is entered into, the method by which the total price or consideration will be calculated is disclosed in the agreement; and
        
        
    
    *   (c) the agreement is dated.
    
    (3) The supplier must give the consumer oral notice, before the agreement is entered into, of---
        
    *   (a) the consumer's right to cancel the agreement within 5 working days after the date on which the consumer receives a copy of the agreement; and
    
    *   (b) how the consumer may cancel the agreement.
    
    (4) However, if an uninvited direct sale agreement is, or includes, a consumer credit contract (as defined in [section 11][257] of the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act 2003), in relation to that consumer credit contract only,---
        
    *   (a) [Part 2][258] of that Act applies in place of this subpart; and
    
    *   (b) the supplier must give the consumer oral notice, before the agreement is entered into, of--- 
            
        *   (i) the consumer's rights to cancel the agreement under that Act; and
        
        *   (ii) how the consumer may cancel the agreement under that Act.
        
        
    
    (5) For the purposes of subsection (4), a consumer credit contract is included in an uninvited direct sale agreement if that contract was entered into for the purpose of financing the purchase of the goods or services that are the subject of the uninvited direct sale agreement.
    
    (6) To avoid doubt, where an uninvited direct sale agreement includes a consumer credit contract, this subpart continues to apply to every part of the agreement that is not a consumer credit contract.

    *   (b) the time during which the consumer may cancel the agreement under [section 36M][85] has expired, and the consumer has not given notice of cancellation within that time.
    
    (2) However, subsection (1)(a) does not apply if the failure to comply with [section 36L][84] is minor (for example, where a supplier has provided an agreement at a time later than the time specified in section 36L(1)(b)) and does not materially prejudice the consumer.

##### 36Q Consumer's obligations on cancellation of uninvited direct sale agreement 
    
*   (1) On cancellation of an uninvited direct sale agreement in accordance with [section 36M][85], the consumer must,---
        
    *   (a) if the supplier has complied with [section 36P][88], permit the supplier to take possession of any goods that have been provided to the consumer under the agreement---
            
        *   (i) from the address provided by the consumer in the agreement; and
        
        *   (ii) at any reasonable time requested by the supplier; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) take reasonable care of those goods, from the time that the consumer took possession of the goods until the end of 10 working days beginning with the date on which notice was given in accordance with [section 36M][85].
    
    (2) However, if, during the 10 working days referred to in subsection (1)(b), the consumer unreasonably refuses or fails to permit the supplier to take possession of the goods, the consumer's obligation to take reasonable care of the goods continues until the consumer has given the supplier a reasonable opportunity to take possession of the goods.
    
    (3) Despite subsection (1), a consumer may, at the supplier's expense (if the supplier requests the consumer to return the goods and arranges for the goods to be collected from the consumer) or at the consumer's expense (if the consumer chooses to return the goods without a request being made by the supplier), return the goods to the supplier, in which case the consumer's obligation to take care of the goods ceases when the goods are collected from the consumer, or when the consumer sends the goods to the supplier, as the case may be.
    
    (4) However, the consumer is under an obligation to take reasonable care to ensure that the goods will not be damaged in transit and, if the consumer chooses to return the goods without a request being made by the supplier, to also take reasonable care to ensure that the goods will be delivered to the supplier.
    
    (5) To avoid doubt, a consumer is under no obligation---
        
    *   (a) to permit the supplier to take possession of the goods if the supplier has failed to comply with [section 36P][88]; or
    
    *   (b) to deliver, or to arrange delivery of, the goods to the supplier; or
    
    *   (c) to care for the goods other than as required under this section.

    *   (a) arising from the normal use of the goods; or
    
    *   (b) owing to circumstances beyond the consumer's control.
    
    (2) Subsection (1) applies only in relation to the period of custody beginning when the consumer takes delivery of the goods and ending---
        
    *   (a) at the end of 10 working days after the date on which notice was given in accordance with [section 36M][85]; or
    
    *   (b) if [section 36Q(2)][89] applies, when the consumer has given the supplier a reasonable opportunity to take possession of the goods.
    
    (3) If a supplier provided services under the agreement before it was cancelled,---
        
    *   (a) the supplier is not entitled to any compensation for those services; and
    
    *   (b) if the services have resulted in the alteration of, or damage to, the consumer's property, the supplier must, if required by the consumer and at the supplier's expense, return the property to the condition it was in (or as close as is reasonably practicable to that condition) immediately before the services were provided.
    
    (4) A supplier is not entitled to damages, or to enforce any other remedy, in relation to the cancellation of an uninvited direct sale agreement under [section 36M][85], except as provided for in this section.

    *   (b) subsection (1)(b) does not apply if the failure to comply with [section 36U][94] is minor (for example, where a warrantor has provided an agreement at a time later than the time specified in [section 36U(1)(b)][94]) and does not materially prejudice the consumer.
    
    (3) Notice of cancellation may be expressed in any way (including oral or written) that shows the intention of the consumer to cancel or withdraw from the agreement.
    
    (4) For the purposes of subsection (3), the consumer must communicate with the warrantor---

    (6) To avoid doubt, nothing in this section entitles a consumer to cancel any other agreement relating to the goods or services that are the subject of the extended warranty agreement.

    *   (a) prescribing a statement for the purposes of providing the information specified in [section 36U(2)][94], including the size of the lettering of the words in, and the format of, the statement:

##### 36X Definitions
    
*   (1) In this subpart, unless the context otherwise requires,---
    
    _auction_ means a process in which property of any kind (including goods, services, and interests in land) is offered for sale by an auctioneer on behalf of a vendor, and---
        
    *   (a) bids for the property are placed with the auctioneer in real time, whether in person, by telephone, via the Internet, or by any other means; and
    
    *   (b) the property is sold when the auctioneer so indicates
    
    _registered auctioneer_ means an auctioneer registered as an auctioneer under the [Auctioneers Act 2013][260]
    
    _vendor_ means the person whose property is offered for sale at an auction by an auctioneer.
    
    (2) To avoid doubt, a process of selling property is not necessarily an auction for the purpose of this subpart just because it is described as an auction. For example, a process described as an Internet auction, but that provides that any contract of sale resulting from the process is a contract directly between the winner of the bidding and the seller of the property, is not an auction for the purpose of this subpart.

    *   (b) in any other case, the notice must be available to view, before and during the auction, on a readily accessible Internet site.
    
    (2) The notice of terms must include notice of the following:

    *   (c) the goods are acquired in trade; and

##### 36ZF Account and payment of proceeds
