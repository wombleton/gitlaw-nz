##### 93 Public Trust may elect to administer small estates without grant of administration
    
*   (1) This section applies in a case where---

    *   (b) the gross value of the property, as estimated by Public Trust at the time of the election under this section, does not exceed $120,000, or such higher amount as is prescribed by regulations; and

    *   (d) Public Trust would under [Part 5][91] be entitled to obtain a grant of administration.
    
    (2) In such a case Public Trust may, instead of obtaining a grant of administration, file in the High Court an election in writing to administer the estate of the deceased person.
    
    (3) The election must specify---
        
    *   (a) the name, residence, and occupation of the deceased, so far as known to Public Trust:
    
    *   (b) the date of death of the deceased:
    
    *   (c) the property of the deceased situated in New Zealand, as then known.
    
    (4) The election must also contain---
        
    *   (a) if the deceased died intestate, a statement to that effect:
    
    *   (b) if the deceased died testate, a statement that, after due inquiries, Public Trust believes that---
            
        *   (i) the document annexed to the election is the testator's last will (or an exemplification of it, if administration has been granted out of New Zealand); and
        
        *   (ii) the will has been validly executed according to the law governing the execution of wills.
        
        
    
    (5) The election may be filed in the registry of the High Court at Wellington, or in such other registry of the High Court as Public Trust determines either generally or in respect of particular estates.
    
    (6) On the election being filed, Public Trust is to be treated in all respects as the executor of the will or the administrator of the estate, as appropriate, as if administration had been granted to Public Trust.
    
    (7) If, after filing the election, the gross value of property situated in New Zealand to be administered is found to exceed $150,000 or such higher amount as is prescribed by regulations, Public Trust must---
        
    *   (a) as soon as practicable file a memorandum stating that fact, in the registry of the High Court in which the election was filed; and
    
    *   (b) then proceed in the ordinary manner to obtain a grant of administration in New Zealand (for which purpose Public Trust may uplift from the court any will or exemplification filed with the election).
    
    (8) An election may be filed under this section relating to a written informal will to which [subpart 3][256] of Part 2 of the Wills Act 2007 or the Wills Amendment Act 1955 applies. This section does not apply to any other informal will.

    *   (c) the gross value of the property situated in New Zealand left unadministered, as estimated by Public Trust at the time of the election under this section, does not exceed $120,000, or such higher amount as is prescribed by regulations; and
    
    *   (d) no person has, since the death of the last administrator, taken out letters of administration _de bonis non_ in New Zealand in respect of the estate.
    
    (2) In such a case Public Trust may, instead of applying for an order to administer _de bonis non_ in New Zealand, file in the High Court an election in writing to administer the part of the estate left unadministered.

    *   (a) set out the fact of the original grant, and the death of the executors or other administrators; and
    
    *   (b) give particulars of the property situated in New Zealand that is left unadministered; and
    
    *   (c) be filed in the registry of the High Court out of which the original grant was issued.
    
    (4) On the election being filed, Public Trust is to be treated in all respects as administrator of the estate left unadministered, as if an order to administer _de bonis non_ had been granted to Public Trust.
    
    (5) If, after filing the election, the gross value of the property situated in New Zealand to be administered by Public Trust is found to exceed $150,000 or such higher amount as is prescribed by regulations, Public Trust must---

    *   (a) in determining the value of property situated in New Zealand, no account is to be taken of property that is situated out of New Zealand at the time of the filing of the election (whether or not the property is later transferred to New Zealand to Public Trust or any other person in due course of administration, or for any other purpose); but
    
    *   (b) in all other respects, the elections extend and apply to and include property situated out of New Zealand in the same manner and to the same extent in all respects as a grant of administration obtained by Public Trust would, in the circumstances of each particular case, extend or apply to or include that property.

    (3) On the memorandum being filed,---
        
    *   (a) the election ceases to be of any effect; and
