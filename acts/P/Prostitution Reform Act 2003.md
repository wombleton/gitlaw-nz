##### 1 Title
    
*   This Act is the Prostitution Reform Act 2003\.

## Part 1  
Preliminary provisions

##### 2 Commencement
    
*   (1) This Act (other than the provisions referred to in subsection (2)) comes into force on the day after the date on which it receives the Royal assent.
    
    (2) [Part 3][47] and [sections 49][67] and [50(2)][68] come into force 6 months after the date on which this Act receives the Royal assent.

##### 3 Purpose
    
*   The purpose of this Act is to decriminalise prostitution (while not endorsing or morally sanctioning prostitution or its use) and to create a framework that---
        
    *   (a) safeguards the human rights of sex workers and protects them from exploitation:
    
    *   (b) promotes the welfare and occupational health and safety of sex workers:
    
    *   (c) is conducive to public health:
    
    *   (d) prohibits the use in prostitution of persons under 18 years of age:
    
    *   (e) implements certain other related reforms.
    
    

##### 4 Interpretation
    
*   (1) In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,---
    
    _brothel_ means any premises kept or habitually used for the purposes of prostitution; but does not include premises at which accommodation is normally provided on a commercial basis if the prostitution occurs under an arrangement initiated elsewhere
    
    _business of prostitution_ means a business of providing, or arranging the provision of, commercial sexual services
    
    _client_ means a person who receives, or seeks to receive, commercial sexual services
    
    _commercial sexual services_ means sexual services that---
        
    *   (a) involve physical participation by a person in sexual acts with, and for the gratification of, another person; and
    
    *   (b) are provided for payment or other reward (irrespective of whether the reward is given to the person providing the services or another person)
    
    _member_ means a member of the Prostitution Law Review Committee
    
    _premises_ includes a part of premises
    
    _prostitution_ means the provision of commercial sexual services
    
    _Prostitution Law Review Committee_ means the committee appointed under [section 43][59]
    
    _public place_---
        
    *   (a) means a place that is open to, or being used by, the public, whether admission is free or on payment of a charge and whether any owner or occupier of the place is lawfully entitled to exclude or eject a person from that place; and
    
    *   (b) includes any aircraft, hovercraft, ship, ferry, or other vessel, train, or vehicle carrying or available to carry passengers for reward
    
    _sex worker_ means a person who provides commercial sexual services
    
    _small owner-operated brothel_ means a brothel---
        
    *   (a) at which not more than 4 sex workers work; and
    
    *   (b) where each of those sex workers retains control over his or her individual earnings from prostitution carried out at the brothel
    
    _territorial authority_ has the same meaning as in [section 5(1)][71] of the Local Government Act 2002\.
    
    (2) In this Act, a reference to _providing_ or _receiving_ commercial sexual services means to provide or receive those services personally (rather than arranging another person to provide the services or arranging for the services to be received by another person).

##### 5 Definition of operator
    
*   (1) In this Act, _operator_, in relation to a business of prostitution, means a person who, whether alone or with others, owns, operates, controls, or manages the business; and includes (without limitation) any person who---
        
    *   (a) is the director of a company that is an operator; or
    
    *   (b) determines---
            
        *   (i) when or where an individual sex worker will work; or
        
        *   (ii) the conditions in which sex workers in the business work; or
        
        *   (iii) the amount of money, or proportion of an amount of money, that a sex worker receives as payment for prostitution; or
        
        
    
    *   (c) is a person who employs, supervises, or directs any person who does any of the things referred to in paragraph (b).
    
    (2) Despite anything in subsection (1), a sex worker who works at a small owner-operated brothel is not an operator of that business of prostitution, and, for the purposes of this Act, a small owner-operated brothel does not have an operator.

##### 6 Act binds the Crown
    
*   This Act binds the Crown.

## Part 2  
Commercial sexual services

#### Contracts for commercial sexual services not void

##### 7 Contract for provision of commercial sexual services not void
    
*   No contract for the provision of, or arranging the provision of, commercial sexual services is illegal or void on public policy or other similar grounds.

#### Health and safety requirements

##### 8 Operators of businesses of prostitution must adopt and promote safer sex practices
    
*   (1) Every operator of a business of prostitution must---
        
    *   (a) take all reasonable steps to ensure that no commercial sexual services are provided by a sex worker unless a prophylactic sheath or other appropriate barrier is used if those services involve vaginal, anal, or oral penetration or another activity with a similar or greater risk of acquiring or transmitting sexually transmissible infections; and
    
    *   (b) take all reasonable steps to give health information (whether oral or written) to sex workers and clients; and
    
    *   (c) if the person operates a brothel, display health information prominently in that brothel; and
    
    *   (d) not state or imply that a medical examination of a sex worker means the sex worker is not infected, or likely to be infected, with a sexually transmissible infection; and
    
    *   (e) take all other reasonable steps to minimise the risk of sex workers or clients acquiring or transmitting sexually transmissible infections.
    
    (2) Every person who contravenes subsection (1) commits an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000\.
    
    (3) The obligations in this section apply only in relation to commercial sexual services provided for the business and to sex workers and clients in connection with those services.
    
    (4) In this section, _health information_ means information on safer sex practices and on services for the prevention and treatment of sexually transmissible infections.
    
    Section 8(2): amended, on 1 July 2013, by [section 413][72] of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011 (2011 No 81).

##### 9 Sex workers and clients must adopt safer sex practices
    
*   (1) A person must not provide or receive commercial sexual services unless he or she has taken all reasonable steps to ensure a prophylactic sheath or other appropriate barrier is used if those services involve vaginal, anal, or oral penetration or another activity with a similar or greater risk of acquiring or transmitting sexually transmissible infections.
    
    (2) A person must not, for the purpose of providing or receiving commercial sexual services, state or imply that a medical examination of that person means that he or she is not infected, or likely to be infected, with a sexually transmissible infection.
    
    (3) A person who provides or receives commercial sexual services must take all other reasonable steps to minimise the risk of acquiring or transmitting sexually transmissible infections.
    
    (4) Every person who contravenes subsection (1), subsection (2), or subsection (3) commits an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $2,000\.
    
    Section 9(4): amended, on 1 July 2013, by [section 413][72] of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011 (2011 No 81).

##### 10 Application of Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992
    
*   (1) A sex worker is at work for the purposes of the [Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992][73] while providing commercial sexual services.
    
    (2) However, nothing in this Act (including subsection (1)) limits that Act or any regulations or approved codes of practice under that Act.

#### Advertising restrictions

##### 11 Restrictions on advertising commercial sexual services
    
*   (1) Advertisements for commercial sexual services may not be---
        
    *   (a) broadcast on radio or television; or
    
    *   (b) published in a newspaper or periodical, except in the classified advertisements section of the newspaper or periodical; or
    
    *   (c) screened at a public cinema.
    
    (2) A person who does any of the things described in subsection (1), or who authorises any of the things described in that subsection to be done, commits an offence and is liable on conviction to,---
        
    *   (a) in the case of a body corporate, a fine not exceeding $50,000; and
    
    *   (b) in any other case, a fine not exceeding $10,000\.
    
    (3) In this section, _advertisement_ means any words, or any pictorial or other representation, used to notify the availability of, or promote the sale of, commercial sexual services, either generally or specifically.
    
    Section 11(2): amended, on 1 July 2013, by [section 413][72] of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011 (2011 No 81).

#### Territorial authority may make bylaws

##### 12 Bylaws controlling signage advertising commercial sexual services
    
*   (1) A territorial authority may make bylaws for its district that prohibit or regulate signage that is in, or is visible from, a public place, and that advertises commercial sexual services.
    
    (2) Bylaws may be made under this section only if the territorial authority is satisfied that the bylaw is necessary to prevent the public display of signage that---
        
    *   (a) is likely to cause a nuisance or serious offence to ordinary members of the public using the area; or
    
    *   (b) is incompatible with the existing character or use of that area.
    
    (3) Bylaws made under this section may prohibit or regulate signage in any terms, including (without limitation) by imposing restrictions on the content, form, or amount of signage on display.
    
    (4) [Parts 8][74] and [9][75] of the Local Government Act 2002 (which are about, among other things, the enforcement of bylaws and penalties for their breach) apply to a bylaw made under this section as if the bylaw had been made under [section 145][76] of that Act.

##### 13 Procedure for making bylaws
    
*   (1) A bylaw made under [section 12][18] must be made in the same manner in all respects as if it were a bylaw made under the [Local Government Act 2002][77].
    
    (2) Despite subsection (1), a bylaw may be made under [section 12][18] even if, contrary to [section 155(3)][78] of the Local Government Act 2002, it is inconsistent with the [New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990][79].

##### 14 Bylaws regulating location of brothels
    
*   Without limiting [section 145][76] of the Local Government Act 2002, a territorial authority may make bylaws for its district under [section 146][80] of that Act for the purpose of regulating the location of brothels.

#### Resource consents

##### 15 Resource consents in relation to businesses of prostitution
    
*   (1) When considering an application for a resource consent under the [Resource Management Act 1991][81] for a land use relating to a business of prostitution, a territorial authority must have regard to whether the business of prostitution---
        
    *   (a) is likely to cause a nuisance or serious offence to ordinary members of the public using the area in which the land is situated; or
    
    *   (b) is incompatible with the existing character or use of the area in which the land is situated.
    
    (2) Having considered the matters in subsection (1)(a) and (b) as well as the matters it is required to consider under the [Resource Management Act 1991][81], the territorial authority may, in accordance with [sections 104A to 104D][82] of that Act, grant or refuse to grant a resource consent, or, in accordance with [section 108][83] of that Act, impose conditions on any resource consent granted.
    
    (3) Subsection (1) does not limit or affect the operation of the [Resource Management Act 1991][81] in any way, and it may be overriden, with respect to particular areas within a district, by the provisions of a district plan or proposed district plan.

#### Protections for sex workers

##### 16 Inducing or compelling persons to provide commercial sexual services or earnings from prostitution
    
*   (1) No person may do anything described in subsection (2) with the intent of inducing or compelling another person (_person A_) to---
        
    *   (a) provide, or to continue to provide, commercial sexual services to any person; or
    
    *   (b) provide, or to continue to provide, to any person any payment or other reward derived from commercial sexual services provided by person A.
    
    (2) The acts referred to in subsection (1) are any explicit or implied threat or promise that any person (_person B_) will---
        
    *   (a) improperly use, to the detriment of any person, any power or authority arising out of---
            
        *   (i) any occupational or vocational position held by person B; or
        
        *   (ii) any relationship existing between person B and person A:
        
        
    
    *   (b) commit an offence that is punishable by imprisonment:
    
    *   (c) make an accusation or disclosure (whether true or false)---
            
        *   (i) of any offence committed by any person; or
        
        *   (ii) of any other misconduct that is likely to damage seriously the reputation of any person; or
        
        *   (iii) that any person is unlawfully in New Zealand:
        
        
    
    *   (d) supply, or withhold supply of, any controlled drug within the meaning of the [Misuse of Drugs Act 1975][84].
    
    (3) Every person who contravenes subsection (1) commits an offence and is liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 years.
    
    Section 16(3): amended, on 1 July 2013, by [section 413][72] of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011 (2011 No 81).

##### 17 Refusal to provide commercial sexual services
    
*   (1) Despite anything in a contract for the provision of commercial sexual services, a person may, at any time, refuse to provide, or to continue to provide, a commercial sexual service to any other person.
    
    (2) The fact that a person has entered into a contract to provide commercial sexual services does not of itself constitute consent for the purposes of the criminal law if he or she does not consent, or withdraws his or her consent, to providing a commercial sexual service.
    
    (3) However, nothing in this section affects a right (if any) to rescind or cancel, or to recover damages for, a contract for the provision of commercial sexual services that is not performed.

#### Protections for persons refusing to work as sex workers

##### 18 Refusal to work as sex worker does not affect entitlements
    
*   (1) A person's benefit, or entitlement to a benefit, under the [Social Security Act 1964][85] may not be cancelled or affected in any other way by his or her refusal to work, or to continue to work, as a sex worker (and, in this case, that work is not suitable employment for that person under that Act).
    
    (2) A person's entitlements under the [Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation, and Compensation Act 2001][86] may not be lost or affected in any other way by his or her being capable of working as a sex worker if he or she refuses to do, or to continue to do, that kind of work.
    
    (3) In this section, refusal means a _refusal_ to do this kind of work in general, rather than a refusal of a particular job or at a particular time.

#### Application of Immigration Act 1987

##### 19 Application of Immigration Act 2009
    
*   (1) No visa may be granted under the [Immigration Act 2009][87] to a person on the basis that the person---
        
    *   (a) has provided, or intends to provide, commercial sexual services; or
    
    *   (b) has acted, or intends to act, as an operator of a business of prostitution; or
    
    *   (c) has invested, or intends to invest, in a business of prostitution.
    
    (2) It is a condition of every temporary entry class visa granted under the [Immigration Act 2009][87] that the holder of the visa may not, while in New Zealand,---
        
    *   (a) provide commercial sexual services; or
    
    *   (b) act as an operator of a New Zealand business of prostitution; or
    
    *   (c) invest in a New Zealand business of prostitution.
    
    (3) It is sufficient reason for the Minister of Immigration or an immigration officer to determine that a temporary entry class visa holder is liable for deportation under [section 157][88] of the Immigration Act 2009 if the Minister or the officer believes, on reasonable grounds, that the holder is engaged in any of the things listed in subsection (2)(a) to (c) of this section.
    
    (4) Any conditions of a resident visa are deemed not to have been met and the resident is liable for deportation under [section 159][89] of the Immigration Act 2009 if the Minister of Immigration or an immigration officer determines that the holder of a resident visa acts as an operator of, or invests in, a New Zealand business of prostitution.
    
    (5) This section applies to all visas and permits held and all requirements and conditions imposed under the [Immigration Act 1987][90] or the [Immigration Act 2009][87], whether granted or imposed before or after the commencement of this section.
    
    Section 19: substituted, at 2 am on 29 November 2010, by [section 406(1)][91] of the Immigration Act 2009 (2009 No 51).

#### Prohibitions on use in prostitution of persons under 18 years

##### 20 No person may assist person under 18 years in providing commercial sexual services
    
*   No person may cause, assist, facilitate, or encourage a person under 18 years of age to provide commercial sexual services to any person.

##### 21 No person may receive earnings from commercial sexual services provided by person under 18 years
    
*   No person may receive a payment or other reward that he or she knows, or ought reasonably to know, is derived, directly or indirectly, from commercial sexual services provided by a person under 18 years of age.

##### 22 No person may contract for commercial sexual services from, or be client of, person under 18 years
    
*   (1) No person may enter into a contract or other arrangement under which a person under 18 years of age is to provide commercial sexual services to or for that person or another person.
    
    (2) No person may receive commercial sexual services from a person under 18 years of age.

##### 23 Offence to breach prohibitions on use in prostitution of persons under 18 years
    
*   (1) Every person who contravenes [section 20][31], [section 21][32], or [section 22][33] commits an offence and is liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years.
    
    (2) No person contravenes [section 20][31] merely by providing legal advice, counselling, health advice, or any medical services to a person under 18 years of age.
    
    (3) No person under 18 years of age may be charged as a party to an offence committed on or with that person against this section.
    
    Section 23(1): amended, on 1 July 2013, by [section 413][72] of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011 (2011 No 81).

#### Powers to enter and inspect compliance with health and safety requirements

##### 24 Purpose of inspection
    
*   (1) The powers of inspection in [section 26][38] may be used only for the purpose of determining whether or not a person is complying, or has complied, with [section 8][12] or [section 9][13].
    
    (2) This section does not limit the ability of an inspector to report any other offence or suspected offence to the Police or any other relevant agency.

##### 25 Inspectors
    
*   (1) Every person designated as a Medical Officer of Health by the Director-General of Health under the [Health Act 1956][92] is an inspector for the purposes of this Act.
    
    (2) A Medical Officer of Health may also appoint persons as inspectors for his or her health district, on a permanent or temporary basis, for the purposes of this Act.
    
    (3) A Medical Officer of Health may appoint a person as an inspector only if satisfied that he or she is suitably qualified or trained to carry out that role.
    
    (4) That appointment must be in writing and must contain---
        
    *   (a) a reference to this section; and
    
    *   (b) the full name of the appointed person; and
    
    *   (c) a statement of the powers conferred on the appointed person by [section 26][38] and the purpose under [section 24][36] for which those powers may be used.
    
    

##### 26 Powers to enter and inspect compliance with health and safety requirements

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Prostitution Reform Act 2003\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 July 2013, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][119] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][120] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][121] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][122] and [17E][123] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
