    Provided that nothing in such repeal shall have the effect of extending section sixteen of that Act to ships of war or military aircraft taken as prize, and accordingly that section shall have effect as if the following words were inserted therein:---
    
    > "Nothing in this section shall apply to ships of war or military aircraft taken as prize."
    
    (2) Any cause or proceeding commenced in any prize court before such rules as aforesaid come into operation as respects that court may, as the court directs, be either---
        
    *   (a) recommenced and proceeded with in accordance with the said rules; or
    
    *   (b) continued in accordance with the said rules subject to such adaptations as the court may deem necessary to make them applicable to the case; or
    
    *   (c) continued to the determination thereof in accordance with the procedure applicable to the case at the commencement of the cause or proceeding.
    
    This section was amended, as from 1 September 1939, by section [1][7] Prize Act 1939 (2 & 3 Geo 6, c 65) by inserting the words ""or military aircraft"".

##### 2 Short title and construction
    
*   This Act may be cited as the Prize Courts (Procedure) Act 1914, and shall be construed as one with the [Naval Prize Act 1864][6]; and that Act and the [Prize Courts Act 1894][5], and this Act may be cited together as the Naval Prize Acts, 1864 to 1914\.
