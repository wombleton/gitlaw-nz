An Act to provide for the transfer of certain land from the General Trust Board of the Diocese of Auckland of the Anglican Church to the Pehiaweri Maori Church and Marae Incorporated a society duly incorporated under the Incorporated Societies Act 1908
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    Whereas land containing 3.2 hectares more or less being part of the Pehiaweri Block situated in Block V of the Whangarei Survey District was by a deed dated 25 November 1885 (registered in the Auckland District Land Registry under number 102114) conveyed by the Maori owners thereof to trustees as joint tenants upon trust as a site for a church and parsonage or either for the Anglican Church and for religious charitable and educational purposes generally and a church and vicarage were erected thereon: And whereas by an order made on 9 March 1932 the Maori Land Court vested the said land in trust in the General Trust Board of the Diocese of Auckland of the Anglican Church for a church and vicarage and burial ground purposes: And whereas on 28 January 1946 the said land was registered in the Land Registration District of Auckland under the provisions of the Land Transfer Act 1915 and the District Land Registrar issued in respect thereof certificate of title, Volume 769, folio 82 limited as to Parcels and Title and entered a caveat number A225386 thereon to prevent the use of the said land except as a church and vicarage and for burial ground purposes of the Anglican Church in accordance with the said order of the court: And whereas pursuant to [section 204][9] of the Land Transfer Act 1952 the limitation as to title has now expired but caveat number A225386 still affects the said land: And whereas the Pehiaweri Maori Church and Marae Incorporated was incorporated on 8 June 1973 under the [Incorporated Societies Act 1908][10] by elders of the Ngatihau tribe of the Maori people resident at Pehiaweri among whom are descendants of the original Maori owners with the objects inter alia of maintaining the said land and the church and vicarage buildings thereon and it has done so: And whereas the General Trust Board of the Diocese of Auckland is now desirous of transferring the said land to the people of the district and the Pehiaweri Maori Church and Marae Incorporated is desirous of holding the said land for the objects for which it was incorporated but doubt exists as to whether the transfer of the said land can be effected otherwise than by legislation.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Pehiaweri Maori Church and Marae Site Vesting Act 1981\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 7 October 1981, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][12] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][13] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared

For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][14] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][15] and [17E][16] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
