If the cost of the said bridge shall exceed ninety-eight thousand dollars ($98,000), the Minister will provide such extra cost, but if the said bridge shall cost less than that amount the contribution of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) to be paid to the Public Account by the Council in terms of these presents shall then be proportionately reduced.
