    *   (b) before a psychoactive product can be approved for use by individuals, the degree of harm posed by the product to individuals who use it should be assessed by the Authority on the basis of---

### Subpart 5---Cost recovery

##### 90 Costs to be recovered
    
*   The Minister must take all reasonable steps to ensure that the direct and indirect costs of administering this Act that are not provided for by money appropriated by Parliament for the purpose are recovered under this subpart, whether by way of fees, levies, or otherwise.

##### 91 Principles of cost recovery
    
*   (1) In determining the most appropriate method of cost recovery under [section 90][131], the Minister must, as far as is reasonably practicable, have regard to the following principles:
        
    *   (a) equity, in that funding for a particular function, power, or service (or a particular class of function, power, or service) should generally, and to the extent practicable, be sourced from the users or beneficiaries of the relevant functions, powers, or services at a level commensurate with their use of or benefit from the function, power, or service:
    
    *   (b) efficiency, in that the allocation of costs should generally be allocated and recovered in order to ensure that maximum benefits are delivered at minimum cost:
    
    *   (c) justifiability, in that costs should generally be recovered to meet only the actual and reasonable costs (including indirect costs) of the provision of or exercise of the relevant function, power, or service:
    
    *   (d) transparency, in that costs should generally be identified, and allocated as closely as practicable to, tangible service provision in the recovery period in which the service is provided:
    
    *   (e) ease of administration, in that the costs of collection should generally be kept as low as possible.
    
    (2) Costs should not be recovered under this subpart unless---
        
    *   (a) there has been appropriate consultation with persons or organisations that the Authority considers representative of the interests of persons likely to be substantially affected by the exercise of the power; and
    
    *   (b) the persons involved have been given sufficient time and information to make an informed contribution.
    
    (3) Subsection (2) does not require consultation in relation to specific fees or charges, or the specific levels of fees or charges, as long as the fees or charges are set reasonably within the scope of any general consultation.
    
    (4) A failure to comply with subsection (2) does not affect the validity of any regulations made for the purposes of this subpart.
    
    (5) This section does not require the strict apportionment of the costs that are to be recovered for a particular function or service based on usage.
    
    (6) Without limiting the way in which fees and charges may be set under this subpart, a fee or charge may be set at a level or in a way that---
        
    *   (a) is determined by calculations that involve an averaging of costs or potential costs:
    
    *   (b) takes into account costs or potential costs of services (that are not directly to be provided to the person who pays the fee or charge but which are an indirect or potential cost) arising from the delivery of the service to a class of persons or all persons who use the service.
    
    

##### 92 Methods of cost recovery
    
*   The methods by which costs may be recovered under this subpart are as follows:
        
    *   (a) fixed fees or charges:
    
    *   (b) fees or charges based on a scale or formula or at a rate determined on a time-unit basis: 
    
    *   (c) fees or charges based on the actual and reasonable costs expended in, or associated with, the performance of a service or function:
    
    *   (d) fees or charges based on estimated costs and paid before the provision of the service, followed by reconciliation and an appropriate further payment or refund after the provision of the service or function:
    
    *   (e) refundable or non-refundable deposits paid before the provision of the service or function: 
    
    *   (f) fees or charges imposed on all users of services, classes of users of services, all beneficiaries of services, or classes of beneficiaries of services:
    
    *   (g) levies:
    
    *   (h) any combination of the above.
    
    

##### 93 Cost recovery to relate generally to financial year
    
*   (1) Except as provided in subsection (2), any regulations under this subpart that set a fee, charge, or levy that applies in any financial year---

    *   (b) except as the regulations may otherwise provide, apply in that year and all subsequent years until revoked or replaced.

    *   (b) in the case of an increase of a fee, charge, or levy or a new fee, charge, or levy,---
            
        *   (i) appropriate consultation has been carried out with persons or representatives of persons substantially affected by the alteration or setting; and
        
        *   (ii) the Minister is satisfied that those persons, or their representatives, agree or substantially agree with the alteration or setting.
        
        
    
    (3) Subsection (1) does not prevent the amendment of any regulation setting a fee, charge, or levy if any substantive alteration effected by the amendment is for the purpose of correcting an error. 
    
    (4) Recovery may be made in any financial year of any shortfall in cost recovery for any of the preceding 4 financial years, and allowance may be made for any over-recovery of costs in those years (including any estimated shortfall or over-recovery for the immediately preceding financial year).

##### 94 Three-yearly review of cost recovery 
    
*   (1) The Minister must review the levels and methods of cost recovery in relation to any class of psychoactive substance or approved products, persons, or other matter at least once in every 3-year period occurring since the original setting of, or latest change to, the cost recovery of those things. 
    
    (2) The Minister must ensure that appropriate consultation takes place in relation to any such review.

    (4) Subsection (1) does not---
        
    *   (a) require all areas of cost recovery to be reviewed at the same time:
