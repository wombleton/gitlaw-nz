An Act to provide for the amendment of the rules of societies which are members of the Royal New Zealand Society for the Health of Women and Children (Incorporated)
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    Whereas the Royal New Zealand Society for the Health of Women and Children (Incorporated) (commonly known as **the Plunket Society** and hereinafter referred to as **the Dominion Society**) was duly incorporated under the [Incorporated Societies Act 1908][11] on 9 November 1920:
    
    And whereas the membership of the Dominion Society consists of a number of incorporated societies (hereinafter referred to as **branch societies**) each registered with the name ""Royal New Zealand Society for the Health of Women and Children \[_name of branch_\] Branch (Incorporated)"":
    
    And whereas (apart from a distinguishing name) the rules of each branch society are the same as the rules of all other branch societies, and it has been the policy of the Dominion Society for many years past that the branch societies should have the same rules:
    
    And whereas rule 31 of the rules adopted by all branch societies is as follows, that is to say:
    
    > *   "31\. These rules may be altered, added to, or rescinded by resolution carried by a majority of three-fifths of the members present and voting at any general meeting of the branch of which due notice has been given, provided that no such alteration, addition, or rescission shall be valid until it is first approved by a general conference other than an interim conference of the society and secondly registered.":
    > 
    > 
    
    And whereas it has proved impracticable to amend the rules of all branch societies at the one time by following the procedure provided in the said rule 31, and the Dominion Society and the branch societies are desirous that the rules of the branch societies should be capable of amendment when the need arises by a resolution passed at a general conference of the Dominion Society and not by a resolution passed at a general meeting of each branch society, and that the said rule 31 and the rules of the Dominion Society be amended accordingly, and that the provisions of [section 21][12] of the Incorporated Societies Act 1908 (which relates to alterations of the rules of incorporated societies) should be modified in their application to the Dominion Society and to the branch societies.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Plunket Society Rules Act 1959\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 8 August 1959, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][13] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][14] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][15] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][16] and [17E][17] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
