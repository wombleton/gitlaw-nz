    A claim in an application provides for a better method of washing clothes when using an existing washing machine. That method is implemented through a computer program on a computer chip that is inserted into the washing machine. The computer program controls the operation of the washing machine. The washing machine is not materially altered in any way to perform the invention.
    
    The Commissioner considers that the actual contribution is a new and improved way of operating a washing machine that gets clothes cleaner and uses less electricity.
    
    While the only thing that is different about the washing machine is the computer program, the actual contribution lies in the way in which the washing machine works (rather than in the computer program per se). The computer program is only the way in which that new method, with its resulting contribution, is implemented.
    
    The actual contribution does not lie solely in it being a computer program. Accordingly, the claim involves an invention that may be patented (namely, the washing machine when using the new method of washing clothes).
    
    ###### A process that is not an invention
    
    An inventor has developed a process for automatically completing the legal documents necessary to register an entity.
    
    The claimed process involves a computer asking questions of a user. The answers are stored in a database and the information is processed using a computer program to produce the required legal documents, which are then sent to the user.
    
    The hardware used is conventional. The only novel aspect is the computer program.
    
    The Commissioner considers that the actual contribution of the claim lies solely in it being a computer program. The mere execution of a method within a computer does not allow the method to be patented. Accordingly, the process is not an invention for the purposes of the Act. 
    
    (4) The Commissioner or the court (as the case may be) must, in identifying the actual contribution made by the alleged invention, consider the following:
        
    *   (a) the substance of the claim (rather than its form and the contribution alleged by the applicant) and the actual contribution it makes:
    
    *   (b) what problem or other issue is to be solved or addressed:
    
    *   (c) how the relevant product or process solves or addresses the problem or other issue:
    
    *   (d) the advantages or benefits of solving or addressing the problem or other issue in that manner:
    
    *   (e) any other matters the Commissioner or the court thinks relevant.
    
    (5) To avoid doubt, a patent must not be granted for anything that is not an invention and not a manner of manufacture under this section.

## Part 2  
Patentable inventions and patent rights

### Subpart 1---Patentable inventions

#### General rules concerning what is patentable

##### 13 Patent may be granted for patentable inventions only
    
*   (1) A patent may be granted for an invention only if it is a patentable invention.
    
    (2) This section is subject to [section 111][143] (which relates to patents of addition).

##### 14 Patentable inventions
    
*   An invention is a _patentable invention_ if the invention, so far as claimed in a claim,---
        
    *   (a) is a manner of manufacture within the meaning of section 6 of the Statute of Monopolies; and
    
    *   (b) when compared with the prior art base---
            
        *   (i) is novel; and
        
        *   (ii) involves an inventive step; and
        
        
    
    *   (c) is useful; and
    
    *   (d) is not excluded from being a patentable invention under [section 15][22] or [16][23].

#### Exclusions from patentability

##### 15 Inventions contrary to public order or morality not patentable inventions
    
*   (1) An invention is not a patentable invention if the commercial exploitation of the invention, so far as claimed in a claim, is contrary to---
        
    *   (a) public order (which in this section has the same meaning as the term _ordre public_ as used in Article 27.2 of the TRIPS agreement); or
    
    *   (b) morality.
    
    ###### Examples
    
    The commercial exploitation of the following inventions is contrary to public order or morality and, accordingly, those inventions are not patentable:
        
    *   an invention that is a process for cloning human beings:
    *   an invention that is a process for modifying the germ line genetic identity of human beings:
    *   an invention that involves the use of human embryos for industrial or commercial purposes:
    *   an invention that is a process for modifying the genetic identity of animals that is likely to cause them suffering without any substantial medical benefit to human beings or animals, or an invention that is an animal resulting from such a process.
    
    (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), commercial exploitation must not be regarded as contrary to public order or morality only because it is prohibited by any law in force in New Zealand.
    
    (3) The Commissioner may, for the purpose of making a decision under this section, seek advice from the Māori advisory committee or any person that the Commissioner considers appropriate.
    
    Compare: Patents Act 1977 s 1(3), (4) (UK)

##### 16 Other exclusions

##### 150 Right to bring infringement proceeding if registrable assignment or licence has occurred
    
*   (1) If a person has the right to bring an infringement proceeding under [section 148(1)][193] by virtue of a transaction that must be registered under section 165, that person must not bring the proceeding unless---
        
    *   (a) the person's title or interest was registered at least 1 month before the commencement of the proceeding; or
    
    *   (b) the person has---
            
        *   (i) given at least 1 month's written notice to the proposed defendant of the intention to bring the proceeding; and
        
        *   (ii) registered the person's title or interest before bringing the proceeding.
        
        
    
    (2) However, a person may bring an infringement proceeding in court, despite not having registered the person's title or interest, if---
        
    *   (a) the person would be entitled to do so under [section 148(1)][193] if the title or interest was registered; and
    
    *   (b) the person has given at least 1 month's written notice to the proposed defendant of the intention to bring the proceeding and provided an address for service in New Zealand; and
    
    *   (c) within that notice period, the proposed defendant has not required the proposed plaintiff to register that title or interest.
    
    (3) However, the court may, on application to it, authorise a person to bring an infringement proceeding in court without complying with subsection (1) or (2)(b).

*   (1) If an exclusive licensee brings an infringement proceeding, the patentee must be joined as a defendant (unless joined as a plaintiff).

##### 153 Court must not award damages or account of profits if innocent infringement
    
*   (1) The court must not award damages or an account of profits for infringement of a patent if the defendant proves that at the date of the infringement the defendant did not know, and ought not reasonably to have known, that the patent existed or, in the case of a proceeding under [section 81][105], that the complete specification had become open to public inspection.
    
    (2) It is presumed that a person ought reasonably to have known that a patent existed if---
        
    *   (a) a product is marked so as to indicate it is patented in New Zealand and with the New Zealand patent number; and
    
    *   (b) the person knew, or ought reasonably to have known, of the product.
    
    (3) But there is no presumption if the product is marked merely so as to indicate it is patented.
    
    Compare: 1953 No 64 [s 68(1)][417]

##### 154 Court must refuse damages or account of profits for infringement before amendment to accepted specification

    (2) Subsection (1) does not apply if---
        
    *   (a) the court is satisfied that the specification, as accepted, was framed in good faith and with reasonable skill and knowledge; or
    
    *   (b) it is only an amendment to correct an obvious mistake.

##### 155 Court may refuse damages or account of profits if renewal fees not paid

    Compare: 1953 No 64 [s 68(2)][417]

##### 156 Limits on damages and accounts of profits do not affect power to grant injunction
    
*   Nothing in [sections 153 to 155][199] affects the court's power to grant an injunction in an infringement proceeding.
    
    Compare: 1953 No 64 [s 68(4)][417]

##### 157 Court may grant relief for partially valid patent
    
*   (1) If it is found in an infringement proceeding that a patent is only partially valid, the court may grant relief for that part of the patent that is valid and infringed.
    
    (2) However, the court may grant damages, an account of profits, or costs for that part of the patent only if the plaintiff proves that the invalid claim was framed in good faith and with reasonable skill and knowledge.
    
    (3) It is at the court's discretion whether or not to grant costs and as to the date from which damages or the account of profits should be counted.
    
    (4) The court may, as a condition of the relief, direct that the specification be amended by an application under section 89 (which relates to the amendment of a specification with the leave of the court), and the application may be made even if the other issues in the infringement proceeding have not yet been determined.
    
    Compare: 1953 No 64 [s 71][418]

##### 158 Court may grant costs for subsequent proceeding if validity of specifications contested
    
*   (1) If the validity of a claim of a specification is contested in a proceeding and the court finds the claim to be valid, the court may certify that the claim's validity was contested in that proceeding.
    
    (2) A party who is relying on the validity of that claim in any subsequent infringement or revocation proceeding is then entitled to reasonable solicitor-client costs for the certified claim if a final order or judgment is made or given in favour of that party.
    
    (3) This section does not apply to the costs of any appeal in the subsequent proceeding.

#### Transitional provisions for patents and patent applications

##### 253 Outline of transitional provisions for patents
    
*   (1) The general scheme and effect of the transitional provisions for patents on and from the commencement of [Part 3][44] of this Act (**commencement**) is as follows:
        
    *   (a) this Act applies to patents granted under the [Patents Act 1953][360] (but patents retain their existing key dates, term, and grounds for revocation):
    
    *   (b) patent applications made under the [Patents Act 1953][360] continue to be dealt with under that Act unless a complete specification is filed on or after commencement and, in this case, the complete specification may be filed only under this Act and this Act then applies to the patent application:
    
    *   (c) Treaty applications---
            
        *   (i) continue to be dealt with under the [Patents Act 1953][360] if the applicant has fulfilled the applicant's obligations under Article 22(1) or 39(1)(a) of the Patent Cooperation Treaty before commencement; and
        
        *   (ii) must be dealt with under this Act if the applicant did not fulfil those obligations before that time:
        
        
    
    *   (d) there are particular transitional provisions for post-dated applications and divisional applications.
    
    (2) This section is a guide only to the general scheme and effect of the transitional provisions for patents.

##### 254 Transitional provision for patents granted under Patents Act 1953
    
*   (1) This Act applies to a patent granted under the [Patents Act 1953][360] as if it were granted under this Act.
    
    (2) However,---
        
    *   (a) the patent retains its original date of filing of the patent application, patent date (that is the date of filing of the complete specification), priority date or dates, date of the publication of the accepted complete specification, date that the patent was granted, and date that the next renewal fee was due under the [Patents Act 1953][360]; and
    
    *   (b) the patent retains its existing term; and
    
    *   (c) the next renewal fee (after this section comes into force) must be paid when due in accordance with the [Patents Act 1953][360] but, after that due date, renewal fees become due in accordance with this Act; and
    
    *   (d) on a re-examination of the patent application and the complete specification under section 95, the grounds that a person may specify in a request for re-examination, and that the Commissioner may consider and report on, are the grounds in [section 41(1)][403] of the Patents Act 1953 (rather than the grounds in [section 114][147] of this Act); and
    
    *   (e) the Commissioner or the court may revoke the patent under this Act only on the grounds set out in [section 41(1) or (3)][403] of the Patents Act 1953, and those grounds are available as grounds of defence in a proceeding for the infringement of the patent (rather than the grounds in [section 114][147] of this Act); and
    
    *   (f) [section 146][189] of this Act does not apply; and
    
    *   (g) in relation to any existing endorsement of the patent under [section 44][479] of the Patents Act 1953,---
            
        *   (i) the repeals in [section 247][331] do not affect the endorsement; and
        
        *   (ii) [sections 44][479] and [45][480] of the Patents Act 1953 continue to apply to the patent for the purposes of the endorsement, as if [sections 247 to 249][331] were not in force (and accordingly, renewal fees remain at one-half of the fees otherwise payable under this Act while the patent is so endorsed).
        
        
    
    

##### 255 Patent applications made under Patents Act 1953 continue under that Act
    
*   (1) The [Patents Act 1953][360] (and the regulations, orders, directions, and other matters made under it) continues to apply, as if [sections 247 to 249][331] were not in force, for the purposes of---
        
    *   (a) a patent application made under that Act before the commencement of [Part 3][44] of this Act:
    
    *   (b) the bringing and completion of any application, request, notice, or other proceeding relating to that application (whether commenced before or after the commencement of [Part 3][44] of this Act).
    
    (2) Any reference in any other enactment to a repealed provision of the [Patents Act 1953][360] (or a revoked provision of any regulations made under it) continues to apply for the purposes of subsection (1) as if the reference had not been repealed or amended by this Act.
    
    (3) [Section 254][339] applies to any patent granted under the [Patents Act 1953][360] in respect of that application.
    
    (4) This section is subject to [sections 256][341], [257][342], and [259][344].

*   (1) Despite section 255,---
        
    *   (a) a complete specification may not be filed under the [Patents Act 1953][360] on or after the commencement of [Part 3][44] of this Act (unless [section 258][343] applies to the complete specification); and
    
    *   (b) the complete specification must instead comply with, and be filed under, this Act; and
    
    *   (c) on and from the date on which the complete specification is filed, this Act applies in respect of the patent application (and any application, request, notice, or other proceeding relating to it) as if it were made under this Act (including as to the priority date).
    
    (2) Subsection (1) applies whether the complete specification is filed for one of the following reasons or any other reason:
        
    *   (a) only a provisional specification was filed before that commencement; or
    
    *   (b) the original complete specification was directed (whether before or after that commencement) to be treated as a provisional specification under [section 9(4)][380] of the Patents Act 1953\.
    
    (3) If a complete specification is provided for 2 or more patent applications that are cognate or of which one is a modification of another, this section applies to those 2 or more patent applications.

##### 257 This Act applies if patent application under Patents Act 1953 is post-dated
    
*   If a patent application made under the [Patents Act 1953][360] is post-dated to a date that is on or after the commencement of [Part 3][44] of this Act, this Act applies to the patent application as if the patent application had been made under this Act.

##### 258 Patents Act 1953 applies to divisional applications dated before commencement
    
*   (1) This section applies to a fresh patent application that is made on or after the commencement of [Part 3][44] of this Act (and any complete specification that is filed at the same time) if---
        
    *   (a) the fresh patent application is made for any part of the subject matter of a patent application to which the [Patents Act 195][360]3 applies under [section 255][340] or [259][344]; and
    
    *   (b) the fresh patent application is given a date before that commencement.
    
    (2) The fresh patent application must be treated as a patent application made under the [Patents Act 1953][360] (and [section 255][340] applies to it) and the complete specification must be treated as having been filed on the date given to the fresh patent application.

##### 259 Which Act applies to Treaty applications
    
*   (1) The [Patents Act 195][360]3 (and the regulations, orders, directions, and other matters made under it) continues to apply, as if [sections 247 to 249][331] were not in force, for the purposes of---
        
    *   (a) a Treaty application if the applicant fulfilled the applicant's obligations under Article 22(1) or 39(1)(a) of the Patent Cooperation Treaty before the commencement of [Part 3][44] of this Act:
    
    *   (b) the bringing and completion of any application, request, notice, or other proceeding relating to that application (whether commenced before or after the commencement of Part 3 of this Act).
    
    (2) Any reference in any other enactment to a repealed provision of the [Patents Act 1953][360] (or a revoked provision of any regulations made under it) continues to apply for the purposes of subsection (1) as if the reference had not been repealed or amended by this Act.
    
    (3) [Section 254][339] applies to any patent granted under the [Patents Act 1953][360] in respect of that application.
    
    (4) However, this Act applies to a Treaty application if the applicant did not fulfil those obligations before the commencement of [Part 3][44].
