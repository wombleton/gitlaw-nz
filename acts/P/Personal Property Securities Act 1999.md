##### 7 Part 3 (Principles relating to enforceability of security interests)

    *   when a security agreement is enforceable against the parties to the security agreement and third parties (persons who are not parties to the security agreement):

Attachment occurs when the secured party gives value for the loan, the debtor has rights in the personal property that is used as security for the loan, and, in the case of third parties, the security agreement is enforceable against third parties:
    *   the perfection of security interests. Perfection involves the concept of attachment together with 1 of the methods of achieving perfection, such as registration of a financing statement or the secured party taking possession of the collateral (personal property that is subject to a security interest). Perfection is relevant to giving a secured party priority over a third party.

    *   contains provisions relating to the priority between security interests and other interests (which may include other security interests) in particular kinds of personal property, such as money, negotiable instruments, investment securities, chattel paper, and crops:
    *   also deals with the priority of liens arising out of materials or services provided in respect of goods, the priority of the rights of an assignee of accounts receivable or chattel paper, and the priority of an execution creditor.
    
    

##### 12 Part 9 (Enforcement of security interests)
    
*   [Part 9][142] contains a secured party's remedies when a debtor is in default.

##### 31 Position where debtor relocates to another jurisdiction, etc
    
*   If a debtor relocates to another jurisdiction or transfers an interest in the collateral to a person located in another jurisdiction, a security interest perfected in accordance with the law applicable, as provided in [section 30][39], continues to be perfected in New Zealand if it is perfected in the other jurisdiction by the earliest of the following:
        
    *   (a) not later than 60 days after the day on which the debtor relocates or transfers an interest in the collateral to a person located in the other jurisdiction; or
    
    *   (b) not later than 15 days after the day on which the secured party has knowledge that the debtor has relocated or transferred an interest in the collateral to a person located in the other jurisdiction; or

    Compare: Personal Property Security Act 1993 s 7(3) (Saskatchewan)

##### 32 Position where no public record, etc, of perfection of security interest
    
*   (1) If the law governing the perfection of a security interest referred to in [section 30][39] or [section 31][40] does not provide for public registration or recording of the security interest or a notice relating to it, and the collateral is not in the possession of the secured party, the security interest is subordinate to---
        
    *   (a) an interest in an account receivable that is payable in New Zealand; or
    
    *   (b) an interest in goods, an investment security, a negotiable instrument, a negotiable document of title, money, or chattel paper, acquired when the collateral was situated in New Zealand.
    
    (2) Subsection (1) does not apply if the security interest is perfected under this Act before the interest referred to in paragraph (a) of that subsection or paragraph (b) of that subsection arises.
    
    (3) A security interest to which subsection (1) applies may be perfected under this Act.
    
    Compare: Personal Property Security Act 1993 s 7(4), (5) (Saskatchewan)

##### 33 Validity, perfection, etc, of security interest in minerals
    
*   (1) Despite [section 30][39], the validity, perfection, and the effect of perfection or non-perfection of a security interest in minerals, or in an account receivable resulting from the sale of the minerals at the minehead, is governed by the law of the jurisdiction in which the minehead is located if the security interest---
        
    *   (a) is provided for in a security agreement signed, or assented to by letter, telegram, cable, telex message, facsimile, electronic mail, or other similar means of communication, before the minerals are extracted; and
    
    *   (b) attaches to the minerals on extraction or attaches to an account receivable on the sale of the minerals.

Principles relating to enforceability of security interests

#### Purpose of Part

##### 34 Purpose of this Part
    
*   The purpose of this Part is to outline the main principles that are relevant---
        
    *   (a) to determining the enforceability of a security interest against the debtor and third parties:
    
    *   (b) to determining the priority between security interests in the same personal property:
    
    *   (c) to determining the priority between a security interest in personal property and other interests in the same property (for example, the interest of a buyer of goods).
    
    

#### Effectiveness of security agreement

##### 35 Effectiveness of security agreement
    
*   Except as otherwise provided by this Act or any other Act or rule of law or equity, a security agreement is effective according to its terms.
    
    Compare: Personal Property Security Act 1993 s 9(1) (Saskatchewan)

#### Enforceability of security agreements against third parties

##### 36 Enforceability of security agreements against third parties
    
*   (1) A security agreement is enforceable against a third party in respect of particular collateral only if---
        
    *   (a) the collateral is in the possession of the secured party; or
    
    *   (b) the debtor has signed, or has assented to by letter, telegram, cable, telex message, facsimile, electronic mail, or other similar means of communication, a security agreement that contains---
            
        *   (i) an adequate description of the collateral by item or kind that enables the collateral to be identified; or
        
        *   (ii) a statement that a security interest is taken in all of the debtor's present and after-acquired property; or
        
        *   (iii) a statement that a security interest is taken in all of the debtor's present and after-acquired property except for specified items or kinds of personal property.
        
        
    
    (2) To avoid doubt, a security agreement may be enforceable against a third party in respect of particular collateral even though the security agreement is not enforceable against a third party in respect of other collateral to which the security agreement relates.
    
    ###### **Example**
    
    Person A sells a motor to person B.
    
    The invoice relating to the sale of the motor contains contractual terms, including a retention of title clause.
    
    Person B has not signed the invoice.
    
    Person A has a security interest in the motor which is enforceable against person B, but is not enforceable against anyone else.
    
    Compare: Personal Property Security Act 1993 s 10(1), (2) (Saskatchewan)

##### 37 Description of collateral as consumer goods or equipment inadequate
    
*   A description is inadequate for the purposes of [section 36(1)(b)(i)][49] if it describes the collateral as consumer goods or equipment without further reference to the item or kind of collateral.
    
    Compare: Personal Property Security Act 1993 s 10(3) (Saskatchewan)

##### 38 What constitutes adequate description of collateral held as inventory
    
*   Despite [section 36(1)(b)(i)][49], a description of collateral as inventory is adequate only while it is held by the debtor as inventory.
    
    Compare: Personal Property Security Act 1993 s 10(4) (Saskatchewan)

##### 39 Description of proceeds not required for enforceability against third parties
    
*   Except as otherwise provided in this Act, a security interest in proceeds is enforceable against a third party whether or not the security agreement contains a description of the proceeds.
    
    Compare: Personal Property Security Act 1993 s 10(5) (Saskatchewan)

#### Attachment of security interests generally

##### 40 Attachment of security interests generally
    
*   (1) A security interest attaches to collateral when---
        
    *   (a) value is given by the secured party; and
    
    *   (b) the debtor has rights in the collateral; and
    
    *   (c) except for the purpose of enforcing rights between the parties to the security agreement, the security agreement is enforceable against third parties within the meaning of [section 36][49].
    
    (2) Subsection (1) does not apply if the parties to a security agreement have agreed that a security interest attaches at a later time, in which case the security interest attaches at the time specified in the agreement.
    
    (3) For the purposes of subsection (1)(b), a debtor has rights in goods that are leased to the debtor, consigned to the debtor, or sold to the debtor under a conditional sale agreement (including an agreement to sell subject to retention of title) no later than when the debtor obtains possession of the goods.
    
    (4) To avoid doubt, a reference in a security agreement to a floating charge is not an agreement that the security interest created by the floating charge attaches at a later time than the time specified in subsection (1).
    
    ###### **Example**
    
    Person A advances $5,000 to person B in return for a security interest in person B's car and person B has signed a written security agreement in respect of that car.

            Person A registers a financing statement in respect of person B's car.
            
            Subsequently, person A's security interest in person B's car attaches.
            
            Person A's security interest is perfected.
        
        *   (ii) the secured party, or another person on the secured party's behalf, has possession of the collateral (except where possession is a result of seizure or repossession).
            
            ###### **Example**
            
            Person A's security interest in person B's hire purchase agreement (chattel paper) has attached.
            
            Person A takes possession of the hire purchase agreement.
            
            Person A's security interest is perfected.
        
        
    
    (2) Subsection (1) applies regardless of the order in which attachment and either of the steps referred to in paragraph (b) of that subsection occur.

    *   (b) the security interest is subsequently perfected in another way under this Act; and
    
    *   (c) there is no intervening period during which the security interest is unperfected.
    
    ###### **Example**
    
    Person A has perfected its security interest in person B's shares by taking possession of person B's share certificates.
    
    Person A releases the share certificates to person B so that person B can sell the shares.
    
    Person A's security interest in person B's shares, which remains perfected for 10 working days after the share certificates were delivered to person B, is continuously perfected from the time that person A took possession of the share certificates.

    *   (a) those consumer goods are not an accession or do not replace the collateral described in the security agreement; or
    
    *   (b) the security interest in those consumer goods is not a purchase money security interest.
    
    (2) However, in relation to an appropriation of after-acquired property that is consumer goods, such appropriation---
        
    *   (a) must be made by the debtor, either personally or by the debtor's agent; and
    
    *   (b) cannot be made by the creditor acting as the debtor's attorney or agent.
    
    ###### **Example**
    
    Person A and person B have entered into a security agreement, which provides that person A has a security interest in all of person B's present and after-acquired property.
    
    After the security agreement has been entered into, person B purchases a computer for the office.
    
    Person A's security interest in person B's computer attaches when person B buys the computer.

    (2) The amount secured by a security interest in collateral and the proceeds is limited to the value of the collateral at the date of the dealing that gave rise to the proceeds, if the secured party enforces the security interest against both the collateral and the proceeds.
    
    ###### **Example**
    
    Person A has a perfected security interest in person B's car.
    
    The car had a value of $6,000 at the date that person A advanced $4,000 to person B.

## Part 7  
Priority between security interests

#### Priority of security interests generally

##### 66 Priority of security interests in same collateral when Act provides no other way of determining priority
    
*   If this Act provides no other way of determining priority between security interests in the same collateral,---
        
    *   (a) a perfected security interest has priority over an unperfected security interest in the same collateral:
        
        ###### **Example**
        
        Person A's security interest in person B's car has been perfected by registering a financing statement.
        
        Person C's security interest in person B's car has not been perfected.
        
        Person A's perfected security interest in person B's car has priority over person C's unperfected security interest in person B's car.
    
    *   (b) priority between perfected security interests in the same collateral (where perfection has been continuous) is to be determined by the order of whichever of the following first occurs in relation to a particular security interest:
            
        *   (i) the registration of a financing statement:
        
        *   (ii) the secured party, or another person on the secured party's behalf, taking possession of the collateral (except where possession is a result of seizure or repossession):
        
        *   (iii) the temporary perfection of the security interest in accordance with this Act:
        
        ###### **Example**
        
        Person A registers a financing statement in respect of person B's present and after-acquired property before person C registers a financing statement in respect of the same collateral.
        
        Person A's perfected security interest has priority over person C's perfected security interest in the same collateral.
    
    *   (c) priority between unperfected security interests in the same collateral is to be determined by the order of attachment of the security interests.
        
        ###### **Example**
        
        Person A and person C have not perfected their respective security interests in person B's car.
        
        Person A's security interest in person B's car was the first to attach.
        
        Person A's security interest has priority over person C's security interest in person B's car.
    
    Compare: Personal Property Security Act 1993 s 35(1) (Saskatchewan)

##### 67 Original method of perfection applies to continuously perfected security interest
    
*   For the purposes of [section 66][91], a continuously perfected security interest is to be treated at all times as perfected by the method by which it was originally perfected.
    
    Compare: Personal Property Security Act 1993 s 35(2) (Saskatchewan)

##### 68 Time of registration, etc, of original collateral is also time of registration, etc, of proceeds
    
*   For the purposes of [section 66][91], the time of registration, possession, or perfection of a security interest in original collateral is also the time of registration, possession, or perfection of its proceeds.
    
    Compare: Personal Property Security Act 1993 s 35(3) (Saskatchewan)

##### 69 Transfer of security interests does not affect priority
    
*   A security interest that is transferred has the same priority as it had at the time of the transfer.
    
    Compare: Personal Property Security Act 1993 s 23(2) (Saskatchewan)

##### 70 Voluntary subordination of security interests
    
*   (1) A secured party may, in a security agreement or otherwise, subordinate the secured party's security interest to any other interest.
    
    (2) An agreement to subordinate a security interest is effective according to its terms between the parties and may be enforced by a third party if the third party is the person, or 1 of a class of persons, for whose benefit the agreement is intended.
    
    (3) A security interest is not created only by an agreement or undertaking to postpone or subordinate the following:
        
    *   (a) the right of a person to performance of all or any part of an obligation to the right of another person to the performance of all or any part of another obligation of the same debtor:
    
    *   (b) all or any part of the rights of a secured party under a security agreement to all or any part of the rights of another secured party under another security agreement with the same debtor.

##### 71 Security agreement may provide for future advances
    
*   A security agreement may provide for future advances.
    
    Section 71: substituted, on 1 May 2002, by [section 7][337] of the Personal Property Securities Amendment Act 2001 (2001 No 23).

##### 72 Priority of security interest applies to all advances
    
*   A security interest has the same priority in respect of all advances, including future advances.
    
    Compare: Personal Property Security Act 1993 s 35(5) (Saskatchewan)

#### Priority of purchase money security interests

##### 73 Priority of purchase money security interest in collateral or its proceeds, other than inventory or intangibles
    
*   (1) A purchase money security interest in collateral or its proceeds, other than inventory or intangibles, has priority over a non-purchase money security interest in the same collateral given by the same debtor if the purchase money security interest in the collateral or its proceeds is perfected not later than 10 working days after the day on which the debtor, or another person at the request of the debtor, obtained possession of the collateral, whichever is earlier.
    
    ###### **Example**
    
    Person A has a perfected security interest in all of person B's present and after-acquired property.
    
    Person B buys a car on hire purchase from person C.
    
    Person C registers a financing statement in respect of person B's car 5 working days after person B took possession of the new car.
    
    Person C's security interest in person B's car has priority over person A's security interest in person B's car.
    
    (2) However, [section 103A][141] overrides this section.
    
    Compare: Personal Property Security Act 1993 s 34(2)(a) (Saskatchewan)
    
    Section 73(2): added, on 24 November 2009, by [section 21][338] of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Amendment Act 2009 (2009 No 53).

##### 74 Priority of purchase money security interest in inventory or its proceeds
    
*   A purchase money security interest in inventory or its proceeds has priority over a non-purchase money security interest in the same collateral given by the same debtor if the purchase money security interest in the inventory or its proceeds is perfected at the time the debtor, or another person at the request of the debtor, obtains possession of the collateral, whichever is earlier.
    
    ###### **Example**
    
    Person A makes a loan to person B (a car dealer) for the purchase of inventory (cars).
    
    Person A registers a financing statement in respect of person B's inventory before person B obtains possession of the cars.
    
    Before person A registered its financing statement in respect of person B's inventory, person C had registered a financing statement in respect of person B's inventory.
    
    Person A's purchase money security interest in person B's inventory has priority over person C's security interest in person B's inventory.
    
    Compare: Personal Property Security Act 1993 s 34(3) (Saskatchewan)

##### 75 Priority of purchase money security interest in intangible or its proceeds
    
*   A purchase money security interest in an intangible or its proceeds has priority over a non-purchase money security interest in the same collateral given by the same debtor if the purchase money security interest in the intangible or its proceeds is perfected not later than 10 working days after the day on which the security interest in the intangible attached.
    
    ###### **Example**

    Compare: Personal Property Security Act 1993 s 34(2)(b) (Saskatchewan)

##### 75A Non-proceeds security interest in accounts receivable
