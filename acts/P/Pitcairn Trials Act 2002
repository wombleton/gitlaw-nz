    *   (b) to remove a person from a Pitcairn Court's premises.
    
    (2) Nothing in this section or [section 22][30] prevents the appropriate New Zealand authorities from entering a Pitcairn Court's premises without the express consent of the Registrar or of an official designated by the Registrar if,---

    (2) However, nothing in this section prevents a Pitcairn Court from waiving in a particular case its immunity from suit and legal process under subsection (1), if in the particular case that immunity can be waived without prejudice to the purposes for which it is accorded.
    
    (3) If a Pitcairn Court grants a waiver referred to in subsection (2), a separate waiver of immunity is required before a judgment may be executed against that Pitcairn Court or against property, funds, or assets of that Pitcairn Court.
    
    Compare: SR 1983/195 [cl 4][118]; SR 2000/247 [cl 6][119]

    (3) If it is not waived as referred to in subsection (2), the immunity under subsection (1) continues after the person ceases to hold the office concerned, and after termination of the Agreement, in respect of things done or omitted to be done by the person in the course of the exercise or performance of the person's official functions relating to a Pitcairn trial in New Zealand.
    
    (4) To avoid doubt, immunities under this section are accorded in the interests of the Pitcairn Courts, and in particular for the independent exercise or performance in a Pitcairn trial in New Zealand of the official functions of the persons specified in subsection (1)(a) to (e), and not for the personal benefit of those persons themselves.
    
    Compare: SR 1959/61 [cl 2][122]; SR 2000/196 [cl 14][123]

    (3) If it is not waived as referred to in subsection (2), the immunity under subsection (1) continues after a Pitcairn defence counsel ceases to act for the Pitcairn accused or Pitcairn offender or person subject to a hospital order, and after termination of the Agreement, in respect of things done or omitted to be done by the Pitcairn defence counsel in his or her capacity as counsel for the accused or offender or person in the Pitcairn trial in New Zealand.
    
    (4) To avoid doubt, immunities under this section are accorded to Pitcairn defence counsel for the independent performance of their functions as counsel for a Pitcairn accused or Pitcairn offender or person subject to a hospital order in the Pitcairn trial in New Zealand, and not for the personal benefit of the Pitcairn defence counsel themselves.

    *   (a) the Pitcairn Prosecutor's official functions; or
    
    *   (b) a Pitcairn defence counsel's functions.
    
    (2) However, nothing in this section prevents the right to inviolability under subsection (1) from being waived in a particular case, if in the particular case that right can be waived without prejudice to the purposes for which it is accorded,---
        
    *   (a) in the case of a paper or document relating to the functions of the Pitcairn Prosecutor, by notice given by the Governor; and

*   (1) If it is not practicable to transfer the Pitcairn accused to a Pitcairn Court's premises under [section 32][43] immediately after his or her arrival in New Zealand, then he or she may, with no further authority than this subsection, be held in custody for a period not exceeding 24 hours either,---
        
    *   (a) at the place of arrival, by any 1 or more persons holding the accused in custody immediately before the arrival of the accused in New Zealand; or
    
    *   (b) in Police custody, by any 1 or more members of the New Zealand Police.
    
    (2) If it appears to a member of the New Zealand Police that the transfer to a Pitcairn Court's premises is unlikely to take place within the 24-hour period referred to in subsection (1), an application must be made under subsection (3).
    
    (3) A New Zealand District Court may, on an application for the purpose in writing by a member of the New Zealand Police, order that the accused be held in custody in a New Zealand prison for a reasonable period exceeding 24 hours that the District Court considers necessary to facilitate the transfer of the accused to a Pitcairn Court's premises.

##### 34 Protection for overseas Pitcairn accused

    (3) To avoid doubt, nothing in this section applies to an accused if, when the Minister receives a request under [section 31][42] in respect of the accused, [section 35][47] applies in respect of the accused.
    
    Compare: 1992 No 86 [s 17][126]

#### Surrender of Pitcairn accused in New Zealand

##### 35 Surrender of Pitcairn accused in New Zealand
    
*   (1) In relation to the surrender of a Pitcairn accused (being a person who is, or is suspected of being, in New Zealand, or on his or her way to New Zealand) in respect of an offence to be tried by a Pitcairn Court according to Pitcairn law in a Pitcairn trial at the Pitcairn Court's premises, the provisions of the [Extradition Act 1999][106] (except those of [Part 3][108], but including those of any relevant regulations made under that Act) apply---
        
    *   (a) as if Pitcairn were a designated country under that Act (and, for the purposes of this paragraph, it does not matter whether or not the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, or Pitcairn, or any other part or parts of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland become a designated country under that Act); and
    
    *   (b) as if the accused would, if surrendered in relation to the offence, be transported out of New Zealand to be dealt with according to Pitcairn law.
    
    (2) However, those provisions apply subject to all necessary modifications (for example, subject to those in [Schedule 2][92]).
    
    (3) Despite subsection (1), and without limiting subsection (2), in proceedings under the provisions of the [Extradition Act 1999][106] that are applied by this section,---
        
    *   (a) the court cannot make a determination under [section 45(4)][127] of that Act, but may, under [section 48(4)][128] of that Act and in the situations referred to in that subsection, refer the case to the Minister under section 48(5) of that Act; and
    
    *   (b) the court is not required to refer New Zealand citizens' cases to the Minister under [section 48(1)(a)][128] of that Act.
    
    (4) To avoid doubt, nothing in this section or [section 36][48] or [Schedule 2][92] prevents an accused from appearing voluntarily before a Pitcairn Court at the Pitcairn Court's premises if no proceedings (being proceedings under the provisions of the [Extradition Act 1999][106] that are applied by this section) have been commenced in respect of the accused.

##### 36 Transfer to Pitcairn Court's premises of Pitcairn accused who is to be surrendered by New Zealand
    
*   (1) In the situation stated in subsection (2), the accused---
        
    *   (a) must be promptly surrendered in relation to the offence (referred to in [section 35(1)][47]) for which surrender is sought; and
    
    *   (b) must be promptly transferred in custody to a Pitcairn Court's premises for the purposes of the Pitcairn trial referred to in [section 35(1)][47] by the officer referred to in [section 67(c)][129] of the Extradition Act 1999 (as applied by section 35 of this Act).
    
    (2) The situation referred to in subsection (1) is that, in proceedings under the provisions of the [Extradition Act 1999][106] that are applied by [section 35][47] of this Act,---
        
    *   (a) the court or the Minister makes a surrender order or a temporary surrender order in relation to a Pitcairn accused and in relation to the offence (referred to in [section 35(1)][47]) for which surrender is sought; and
    
    *   (b) that order takes effect.
    
    (3) Nothing in this section prevents an accused surrendered under a temporary surrender order from being returned to detention in a prison in New Zealand in respect of a sentence of imprisonment imposed for an offence against the law of New Zealand, in accordance with undertakings given by Pitcairn under [section 54(4)(b)(ii)][130] of the Extradition Act 1999 (as applied by [section 35][47] of this Act).
    
    (4) If, because of a surrender order under [section 55(1)][131] of the Extradition Act 1999 (as applied by [section 35][47] of this Act), the accused is surrendered to serve a sentence that was imposed as a result of his or her having been temporarily surrendered to Pitcairn, the sentence may be served in New Zealand in accordance with an enforcement order under [Part 3][73] of this Act.

#### Detention in Court's premises and remand in custody in prison

        *   (i) a witness in the course of giving evidence:
        
        *   (ii) a person who may have committed a contempt of court, or an offence against Pitcairn law, within the Pitcairn Court's premises:
        
        *   (iii) a person found guilty summarily of a contempt of court.
        
        
    
    (2) Pitcairn law applies to the detention in the Pitcairn Court's premises of a person specified in subsection (1)(a) or (b).
    
    (3) Detention referred to in this section must be only detention that is reasonably necessary to allow the Pitcairn trial concerned to be conducted on the particular day concerned.
    
    (4) To avoid doubt, nothing in this section permits the validity of detention referred to in this section to be challenged in legal proceedings in New Zealand courts (for example, on the grounds that the detention is not detention of the kind described in subsection (3)).

##### 38 Remand in custody in prison of Pitcairn accused and Pitcairn offenders
    
*   (1) In this section, _Pitcairn accused_ or _accused_ includes a Pitcairn offender who is yet to be sentenced or otherwise dealt with by a Pitcairn Court in relation to any matter.
    
    (2) This section applies to a Pitcairn accused if a Pitcairn Court sitting in New Zealand makes an order (or issues a warrant) requiring that the accused be remanded in custody that is not---
        
    *   (a) custody in the Pitcairn Court's premises; or
    
    *   (b) custody in a hospital or other similar institution.
    
    (3) The order (or warrant) is sufficient authority for the detention of the accused in a prison for the period (being a period not exceeding 28 days after the making of the order (or the issuing of the warrant)) specified in the order (or warrant).
    
    (4) Nothing in this section prevents a Pitcairn Court sitting in New Zealand from making 2 or more orders (or issuing 2 or more warrants) remanding the same accused in custody.
    
    (5) If this section applies to an accused,---
        
    *   (a) the order (or warrant) has effect as if it were an order (or warrant) of a New Zealand court remanding the accused in custody for an offence against the law of New Zealand; and
    
    *   (b) New Zealand law applies to the accused while he or she is liable to be detained under the order (or warrant), except as provided in [section 18][25].

    _Pitcairn accused_ or _accused_ includes a Pitcairn offender who is remanded on bail pending sentencing by a Pitcairn Court
    
    _Pitcairn Court bail order_ includes an instrument (however described) by which a Pitcairn Court---
        
    *   (a) grants bail to a Pitcairn accused; or
    
    *   (b) admits a Pitcairn accused to bail; or
    
    *   (c) releases a Pitcairn accused on bail; or
    
    *   (d) orders the admission of a Pitcairn accused to bail.
    
    

##### 40 Endorsed Pitcairn Court bail order has effect in New Zealand
    
*   (1) A Pitcairn Court bail order that is endorsed under [section 41][55] has effect in New Zealand according to its terms (for example, for the period (if any) specified in the order) as if it were an order made by a New Zealand District Court.
    
    (2) Despite subsection (1), the only New Zealand laws relating to bail that apply to a Pitcairn Court bail order that is endorsed under [section 41][55] are [sections 39 to 45][53] of this Act, and therefore nothing in the [Bail Act 2000][133], or in any other New Zealand law relating to bail, applies to an order of that kind.
    
    (3) A member of the New Zealand Police must notify the Pitcairn Prosecutor without delay if---
        
    *   (a) a Pitcairn accused who is required to do so fails to report to the New Zealand Police in accordance with an endorsed Pitcairn Court bail order; or
    
    *   (b) it comes to the attention of a member of the New Zealand Police that a Pitcairn accused has breached any other bail condition to which he or she is subject.
    
    Compare: 1992 No 86 [s 57(1)][134]

##### 41 Pitcairn Court bail orders may be endorsed in New Zealand
    
*   (1) A Pitcairn Court bail order relating to the release on bail of a Pitcairn accused is enforceable in New Zealand (in accordance with Pitcairn law and [sections 39 to 45][53]) if---
        
    *   (a) the Registrar of the Pitcairn Court notifies a New Zealand District Court Judge or a Registrar of a New Zealand District Court of the making of the order and presents him or her with a copy of the order; and
    
    *   (b) he or she endorses the order under this section.
    
    (2) The New Zealand District Court Judge or Registrar of the New Zealand District Court may endorse a Pitcairn Court bail order presented to him or her only if satisfied---
        
    *   (a) that the order---
            
        *   (i) is made in a Pitcairn trial by a Pitcairn Court sitting in New Zealand; and
        
        *   (ii) relates to an accused in that trial; and
        
        *   (iii) states where the accused is to reside during the period of the bail; and
        
        *   (iv) either is in force, or will be in force once endorsed; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) that the accused has accepted the bail conditions.
    
    (3) An endorsement under this section must be in the form set out in [Schedule 3][93] or, if the form in Schedule 3 is replaced by a form prescribed by regulations made under [section 15][20], in that replacement form, except to the extent that any variation is required to fit the circumstances of a particular case.
    
    (4) If a Pitcairn Court bail order is endorsed under this section by a New Zealand District Court Judge or a Registrar of a New Zealand District Court, the Registrar of that New Zealand District Court must---
        
    *   (a) notify the Pitcairn Court that made the order; and
    
    *   (b) arrange for a copy of the endorsed order to be sent to the Police station nearest to where the accused is to reside or to which the accused is to report; and
    
    *   (c) if the accused is in custody in a New Zealand prison, to the manager of that prison.

##### 42 Further provisions on endorsement of bail orders
    
*   (1) A Pitcairn Court bail order may be endorsed under [section 41][55] even though the terms or effects of the order differ (for example, in relation to the content of the bail conditions or in relation to the duration of the order) from those of a bail order that is likely to be made in the particular circumstances by a New Zealand court in a corresponding New Zealand case.
    
    (2) Two or more Pitcairn Court bail orders may be endorsed under [section 41][55] in relation to the same accused at different times during 1 or more Pitcairn trials.
    
    (3) This section is for the avoidance of doubt.

##### 43 Procedure where Pitcairn Court issues arrest warrant
    
*   (1) If a Pitcairn Court issues a warrant for the arrest of a Pitcairn accused to whom an endorsed Pitcairn Court bail order relates, the Pitcairn Court's arrest warrant may be executed in New Zealand by a member of the New Zealand Police (according to its terms and without the need for the warrant itself to be separately endorsed) as if it were an arrest warrant issued by a New Zealand court.
    
    (2) An accused who is arrested under the Pitcairn Court's arrest warrant must be brought before the Pitcairn Court at the Pitcairn Court's premises as soon as possible.
    
    (3) To avoid doubt, in relation to the arrest of an accused under this section, the member of the New Zealand Police has all the powers and protections that he or she would have under New Zealand law in relation to the execution of a New Zealand arrest warrant.

##### 44 Arrest without warrant of Pitcairn accused on bail
    
*   (1) A member of the New Zealand Police may arrest without warrant in New Zealand a Pitcairn accused released on bail by order of a Pitcairn Court if the Pitcairn Court bail order concerned has been endorsed under [section 41][55] and the member of the New Zealand Police believes on reasonable grounds---
        
    *   (a) that the accused has absconded, or is about to abscond, for the purpose of evading justice; or
    
    *   (b) that the accused has contravened or failed to comply with any condition of bail.
    
    (2) An accused who is arrested under subsection (1) must be brought before the Pitcairn Court at the Pitcairn Court's premises as soon as possible.
    
    (3) To avoid doubt, in relation to the arrest of an accused under this section, the member of the New Zealand Police has the same powers and protections as he or she would have under New Zealand law in relation to the arrest without warrant of a defendant under [section 35][136] of the Bail Act 2000\.
    
    Compare: 2000 No 38 [ss 35][136], [58][137]

*   (1) If it is not practicable to bring the Pitcairn accused referred to in [section 43(2)][57] or [section 44(2)][58] before the Pitcairn Court in New Zealand immediately following arrest, he or she must instead be brought before a New Zealand District Court Judge as soon as possible.
    
    (2) A Judge before whom a person is brought under subsection (1) must order that the person be transferred to the Pitcairn Court's premises as soon as practicable, and must make any other orders relating to the person's detention pending or during transfer that may be necessary in the circumstances, if the Judge is satisfied---
        
    *   (a) that the person is an accused to whom a Pitcairn Court bail order endorsed under [section 41][55] relates; and
    
    *   (b) if (and only if) the person was arrested under [section 44(1)][58], that the person,---
            
        *   (i) had absconded, or was about to abscond, for the purpose of evading justice, when he or she was arrested; or
        
        *   (ii) has contravened or failed to comply with any condition of bail.

    (3) Nothing in this section prevents a Pitcairn Court sitting in New Zealand from making 2 or more orders (or issuing 2 or more warrants) remanding the same accused or offender in custody, but the total period of detention must not exceed 1 month.
    
    (4) If this section applies to an accused or offender,---

    (2) The Pitcairn warrant of commitment, supervision order, or community work order (as the case may be) relating to the sentence is sufficient authority for the detention under this section of the offender who is subject to the sentence.
    
    (3) Despite subsection (1), the Minister may order the release (subject to any conditions that the Minister thinks fit) of an offender who is liable to be detained under this section but who is subject only to a community-based sentence.

    *   (c) the date that is 3 months after the sentence was imposed, unless, before that date,---
            
        *   (i) an enforcement order is made with respect to the sentence (in which case the offender ceases to be liable to detention under this section and commences serving his or her sentence under the enforcement order); or
        
        *   (ii) an order is made under subsection (5).
        
        
    
    (5) By order under this subsection, the Minister may extend by a further 3 months the period referred to in subsection (4)(c), but only if---
        
    *   (a) the offender has appealed to a Pitcairn Court against a conviction or sentence; and
    
    *   (b) the Minister considers that the making of the enforcement order, or the decision on whether to enforce the sentence, ought to be delayed pending the outcome of the appeal.

    (3) The hospital order made by the Pitcairn Court is sufficient authority for the detention of the person under this section as a special patient.
    
    (4) A person who is subject to a hospital order may not be detained under this section beyond whichever of the following dates first applies:
        
    *   (a) the date on which the Director of Mental Health receives notice under [section 59][79] that an enforcement order will not be made:

    *   (c) 3 months after the order was made unless, before that date,---
            
        *   (i) an enforcement order is made with respect to the order (in which case the offender ceases to be detained under this section and commences detention under the enforcement order instead); or
        
        *   (ii) an order is made under subsection (5).
        
        
    
    (5) By order made under this subsection, the Minister may extend by a further 3 months the period referred to in subsection (4)(c), but only if---
        
    *   (a) the person has appealed to a Pitcairn Court against the hospital order; and
    
    *   (b) the Minister considers that the making of the enforcement order, or the decision on whether to enforce the order, ought to be delayed pending the outcome of the appeal.
    
    (6) The Minister may make an order under subsection (5) only once in respect of a particular hospital order.

#### What happens if enforcement order not to be made

##### 62 Detention and removal if enforcement order will not be made
    
*   (1) If the Minister gives notice under [section 59][79] that an enforcement order will not be made in respect of a particular Pitcairn sentence or hospital order, the Minister may make an order under this section in respect of the person who is subject to the sentence or order.
    
    (2) An order under this section is an order---

#### Enforcing Pitcairn sentences and hospital orders

##### 63 Effect of enforcement order
    
*   (1) An enforcement order is authority for the enforcement in New Zealand of a Pitcairn sentence or hospital order and, in particular,---
        
    *   (a) an enforcement order for the enforcement of a sentence of imprisonment has effect in New Zealand as a New Zealand warrant of commitment for imprisonment for the term specified by the Pitcairn Court and, if applicable, as a New Zealand order for minimum period of imprisonment for the period specified by the Pitcairn Court:
    
    *   (b) an enforcement order for the enforcement of a sentence of supervision has effect in New Zealand as a New Zealand order for sentence of supervision for the period specified by the Pitcairn Court:
    
    *   (c) an enforcement order for the enforcement of a sentence of community work has effect in New Zealand as a New Zealand order for sentence of community work for the number of hours specified by the Pitcairn Court:
    
    *   (d) an enforcement order in respect of a person who has been found unfit to plead has effect in New Zealand as if the person were subject to an order under [section 115(1)(a)][147] of the Criminal Justice Act 1985, having been found to be under disability (as defined in [section 108(1)][148] of that Act):
    
    *   (e) an enforcement order in respect of a person who has been found not guilty on the grounds of insanity has effect in New Zealand as an order made under [section 115(1)(b)][147] of the Criminal Justice Act 1985\.
    
    (2) Every Pitcairn sentence and hospital order to which an enforcement order relates must be enforced as far as possible as if the sentence or order, along with any conditions or directions associated with it, had been imposed or made by a New Zealand court, subject only to any modifications required by this Act or the conditions of enforcement (as provided in [section 57][77]).
    
    (3) Despite subsection (1)(b), if an application is made under [section 54(1) or (2)][149] of the Sentencing Act 2002 for the variation or cancellation of a sentence of supervision, the New Zealand court may exercise its powers under section 54(3)(a) of that Act, but, if the court considers that the exercise of powers under section 54(3)(b) or (c) of that Act would be appropriate, it must---
        
    *   (a) refer the matter to the Pitcairn Court for determination; and
    
    *   (b) suspend the sentence pending the decision of that Court and any necessary amendment or cancellation of the relevant enforcement order.
    
    (4) Despite subsection (1)(c), if an application is made under [section 68(1) or (2)][150] of the Sentencing Act 2002 for the variation or cancellation of a sentence of community work, the New Zealand court may not exercise its powers under section 68(3) of that Act, but must---
        
    *   (a) refer the matter to the Pitcairn Court for determination; and
    
    *   (b) suspend the sentence pending the decision of that Court and any necessary amendment or cancellation of the relevant enforcement order.
    
    

##### 64 New Zealand law applies subject to specified exceptions
    
*   (1) The law of New Zealand applies to every person who is subject to an enforcement order as if the person were serving a sentence imposed by a New Zealand court, or were subject to an order made by a New Zealand court (as the case may be).
    
    (2) Subsection (1) is subject to [sections 18][25] and [63(3) and (4)][86], and to subsections (3), (5), and (6) of this section.
    
    (3) A Pitcairn offender or person subject to a hospital order may be removed from New Zealand to another country under either of the following Acts only with the prior consent in writing of the Governor:
        
    *   (a) [Extradition Act 1999][106]:
    
    *   (b) [Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1992][107].
    
    (4) For the avoidance of doubt, if a Pitcairn offender, while subject to an enforcement order, is sentenced in a New Zealand court for a New Zealand offence, the Pitcairn sentence that is the subject of the enforcement order is for all purposes to be treated as if it were a New Zealand sentence, and the [Sentencing Act 2002][151] and the [Parole Act 2002][152] apply accordingly.
    
    (5) For the purpose of determining, under the [Parole Act 2002][152], how much of a sentence an offender has served, the following types of detention that occur before an enforcement order is made, along with the types of detention referred to in [section 91][153] of that Act, are pre-sentence detention:
        
    *   (a) detention overseas during any step in the Pitcairn trial of the offender, or in any associated extradition proceedings, as evidenced by a certificate, signed by the Governor, showing the number of days of that detention:
    
    *   (b) detention in a prison or hospital in New Zealand pursuant to a provision of this Act, if that detention is not, or may not be, already treated as pre-sentence detention under the [Parole Act 2002][152].
    
    (6) Subsection (5) applies, with all necessary modifications, for the purpose of determining the maximum period of detention (as described in [section 116][154] of the Criminal Justice Act 1985) of a person who is subject to a hospital order, having been found by a Pitcairn Court to be unfit to plead.

##### 65 Amending and cancelling enforcement orders
    
*   (1) On receiving notice from a Pitcairn Court that the Court has done any of the things set out in subsection (2), the Minister must amend the relevant enforcement order in a manner that gives effect to the actions of the Pitcairn Court and may, if appropriate, cancel the enforcement order.
    
    (2) The things referred to in subsection (1) are---
        
    *   (a) that a Pitcairn Court has quashed or otherwise nullified the Pitcairn conviction to which the sentence referred to in the enforcement order relates:
    
    *   (b) that a Pitcairn Court has amended the Pitcairn sentence to which the enforcement order relates:
    
    *   (c) that a Pitcairn Court has amended or cancelled the hospital order to which the enforcement order relates.
    
    (3) In subsection (2), a reference to a Pitcairn Court includes a reference to a court sitting outside New Zealand to which the conviction, sentence, or order of a Pitcairn Court has been appealed.
    
    (4) If, through the exercise of the prerogative of mercy under Pitcairn law, a sentence that is subject to an enforcement order is affected, the Minister must give effect to the change by amending or cancelling the enforcement order accordingly.
    
    (5) The Minister may also cancel an enforcement order in any of the following situations:
        
    *   (a) the enforcement order specifies circumstances in which it may be cancelled and the Minister is satisfied that those circumstances apply:
    
    *   (b) the person to whom the order relates is still detained and the Governor requests that the order be cancelled on the grounds that the Pitcairn sentence or hospital order is to be enforced elsewhere than in New Zealand:
    
    *   (c) the Governor requests that the order be cancelled and the Minister is satisfied that, in all the circumstances, the order ought to be cancelled.
    
    (6) The termination of the Agreement does not, in itself, affect any enforcement order.

##### 66 Expiry of enforcement orders
    
*   (1) An enforcement order in respect of an offender who is subject to a sentence of imprisonment expires on the date after the offender's release on which any release conditions to which he or she is subject cease to apply, unless subsection (5) applies.
    
    (2) An enforcement order in respect of an offender who is subject to a community-based sentence expires on the date specified by a probation officer in a notice to the chief executive of the Department of Corrections that identifies the date on which the offender has completed the community-based sentence.
    
    (3) An enforcement order in respect of a person who is subject to a hospital order expires,---
        
    *   (a) in the case of a person who was found by a Pitcairn Court to be unfit to plead, when the Attorney-General directs, under [section 116][154] of the Criminal Justice Act 1985, that the person either be brought before the appropriate court or be held as a patient, rather than as a special patient:
    
    *   (b) in the case of a person who was acquitted on the grounds of insanity, when the person is discharged under [section 117][155] of the Criminal Justice Act 1985 or a direction is given under that section for the person to be held as a patient, rather than as a special patient.
    
    (4) The fact that a person is still subject to an enforcement order does not, of itself, give the person a right to remain in New Zealand, and the person may be required under the [Immigration Act 2009][101] to leave New Zealand even if he or she is still subject to release conditions.
    
    (5) If a person who is subject to an enforcement order is required under the [Immigration Act 2009][101] to leave New Zealand, then, despite anything in this section, the enforcement order expires on the date that the person leaves the country as required under the [Immigration Act 2009][101].
    
    Section 66(4): amended, at 2 am on 29 November 2010, by [section 406(1)][102] of the Immigration Act 2009 (2009 No 51).
    
    Section 66(5): amended, at 2 am on 29 November 2010, by [section 406(1)][102] of the Immigration Act 2009 (2009 No 51).

##### 67 Notice of certain things to be given to Department of Labour
    
*   (1) This section applies with respect only to a person who is subject to an enforcement order and who is not a New Zealand citizen (in this section referred to as an _overseas person_).
    
    (2) The chief executive of the Department of Corrections must, as soon as practicable, advise the chief executive of the Department of Labour of---
        
    *   (a) the key dates and non-parole period (as determined under, and in accordance with, [section 88][156] of the Parole Act 2002) of an overseas person who is subject to a sentence of imprisonment, and of any changes to those dates or that period; and
    
    *   (b) the actual or expected date on which an overseas person who is detained in prison or on home detention is or will be released from detention; and
    
    *   (c) the actual or expected date on which an overseas person who is subject to a community-based sentence finishes or will finish his or her sentence.
    
    (3) With respect to an overseas person who is subject to a sentence of imprisonment, the chief executive of the Department of Labour is deemed to be included in the list in [section 43(2)][157] of the Parole Act 2002 (which lists various people who must receive notice of impending Parole Board hearings).
    
    (4) The person who is in charge of a hospital in which an overseas person is detained must give notice to the chief executive of the Department of Labour, as soon as practicable, of the date on which the overseas person ceases, or will cease, to be a special patient.

*   Under [section 16D][163] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][164] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][165] and [17E][166] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
