    (3) If, by any Order in Council under subsection (2), the name of any class of public body or the name of any specified public body is added to [Schedule 1][7], the Act by or pursuant to which that class of public body or that public body was constituted must, so long as the name remains part of Schedule 1, be read subject to the provisions of this Act.
    
    Section 2: replaced, on 1 July 2003, by [section 262][12] of the Local Government Act 2002 (2002 No 84).

##### 3 Mode of contracting by public bodies
    
*   (1) Any contract which, if made by private persons, must be by deed shall, if made by a public body, be in writing and,---
        
    *   (a) if made by a public body which is a body corporate, shall be made under the seal of the public body:
    
    *   (b) if made by a public body which is the governing authority of a body corporate, shall be made under the seal of the Corporation:
    
    *   (c) if made by a public body whose functions are exercised by any other public body which is a body corporate or is the governing authority of a body corporate, shall be made under the seal of that other public body or under the seal of the Corporation, as the case may be.
    
    (2) Any contract which, if made by private persons, must be in writing signed by the persons to be charged therewith shall, if made by a public body,---
        
    *   (a) be made in the manner specified in subsection (1) as in the case of a deed; or
    
    *   (b) be signed by any member or officer of the public body on behalf of and by authority of the public body; or

    *   (b) in any case where the functions of the public body are exercised by any other public body, by any officer of either public body or any member of that other public body, acting in each case by authority of the first-mentioned public body,---
    
    but no oral contract shall be made for any sum exceeding $1,000\.
    
    (4) Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing provisions of this section, no contract made by or on behalf of a public body shall be invalid by reason only that it was not made in the manner provided by this section, if it was made pursuant to a resolution of the public body or to give effect to a resolution of the public body in relation to contracts generally or in relation to that particular contract.

    (2) Any committee or officer or officers to which or to whom any power of entering into a contract is delegated under the provisions of this section may, without confirmation by the public body, exercise that power in like manner and with the same effect as the public body could itself have exercised it.
    
    (3) Any committee or officer or officers entering into any contract, to which this subsection applies, pursuant to any delegation under this section shall report the same to the public body, in such manner as the public body requires at its next ordinary meeting or, where that is not practicable, at its next succeeding ordinary meeting.
    
    (3A) Subsection (3) applies to all contracts entered into by a committee, officer, or officers except those contracts which the public body has, by resolution conforming with this subsection, determined, either generally or in any particular case, need not be reported back to it by the committee, officer, or officers. The public body may so resolve in respect of any contract for not more than such fraction as it thinks fit (but not exceeding one half) of the amount specified under subsection (1) as the limit of the delegated power of a committee, officer, or officers.
    
    (4) Every delegation under this section shall be revocable by the public body at will, and no such delegation shall prevent the exercise of any power by the public body.
