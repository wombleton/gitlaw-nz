    *   [Part 1][5]---The General Law relating to Partners. ([Sections 4 to 47][7].)
    *   [Part 2][63]---Special Partnerships. ([Sections 48 to 67][64].)
    
    

##### 2 Interpretation

    Compare: 1891 No 6 s 48; Partnership Act 1890 s 46 (UK)

## Part 1  
The general law relating to partners

#### Nature of partnership

##### 4 Definition of partnership
    
*   (1) Partnership is the relation which subsists between persons carrying on a business in common with a view to profit.
    
    (2) But the relation between members of any company or association registered as a company under the [Companies Act 1993][85] or any other Act of the General Assembly for the time being in force and relating to the registration of joint stock, trading, or mining companies, or formed or incorporated by or in pursuance of any other Act of the General Assembly or letters patent, or Royal Charter, is not a partnership within the meaning of this Act.
    
    Compare: 1891 No 6 s 4; Partnership Act 1890 s 1 (UK)
    
    Section 4(2): amended, on 5 December 2013, by [section 14][86] of the Companies Amendment Act 2013 (2013 No 111).
    
    Section 4(2): amended, on 1 July 1994, by [section 2][87] of the Company Law Reform (Transitional Provisions) Act 1994 (1994 No 16).

##### 5 Rules for determining existence of partnership
    
*   In determining whether a partnership does or does not exist regard shall be had to the following rules:
        
    *   (a) joint tenancy, tenancy in common, joint property, or part ownership does not of itself create a partnership as to anything so held or owned, whether the tenants or owners do or do not share any profits made by the use thereof:
    
    *   (b) the sharing of gross returns does not of itself create a partnership, whether the persons sharing such returns have or have not a joint or common right or interest in any property from which or from the use of which the returns are derived:
    
    *   (c) the receipt by a person of a share of the profits of a business is prima facie evidence that he is a partner in the business, but the receipt of such a share or of a payment contingent on or varying with the profits of a business does not of itself make him a partner in the business and, in particular,---
            
        *   (i) the receipt by a person of a debt or other liquidated amount, by instalments or otherwise, out of the accruing profits of a business does not of itself make him a partner in the business or liable as such:
        
        *   (ii) a contract for the remuneration of a servant or agent of a person engaged in a business by a share of the profits of the business does not of itself make the servant or agent a partner in the business or liable as such:
        
        *   (iii) a person being the widow, widower, surviving civil union partner, surviving de facto partner, or child of a deceased partner, and receiving by way of annuity a portion of the profits made in the business in which the deceased person was a partner, is not by reason only of such receipt a partner in the business or liable as such:
        
        *   (iv) the advance of money by way of loan to a person engaged or about to engage in any business on a contract with that person that the lender shall receive a rate of interest varying with the profits, or shall receive a share of the profits arising from carrying on the business, does not of itself make the lender a partner with the person or persons carrying on the business, or liable as such:
        
        *   Provided that the contract is in writing, and signed by or on behalf of all the parties thereto:
        
        *   (v) a person receiving by way of annuity or otherwise a portion of the profits of a business in consideration of the sale by him of the goodwill of the business is not, by reason only of such receipt, a partner in the business or liable as such.
        
        
    
    Compare: 1891 No 6 s 5; Partnership Act 1890 s 2 (UK)
    
    Section 5(c)(iii): amended, on 26 April 2005, by section 7 of the Relationships (Statutory References) Act 2005 (2005 No 3).

##### 6 Rights of person lending or selling in consideration of share of profits in case of bankruptcy
    
*   In the event of any person to whom money has been advanced by way of loan upon such a contract as is mentioned in the last preceding section, or of any buyer of a goodwill in consideration of a share of the profits of the business, being adjudged a bankrupt, entering into an arrangement to pay his creditors less than 100 cents in the dollar, or dying in insolvent circumstances, the lender of the loan shall not be entitled to recover anything in respect of his loan, and the seller of the goodwill shall not be entitled to recover anything in respect of the share of profits contracted for, until the claims of the other creditors of the borrower or buyer for valuable consideration in money or money's worth have been satisfied.
    
    Compare: 1891 No 6 s 6; Partnership Act 1890 s 3 (UK)
    
    Section 6: amended, on 10 July 1967, by section 14(1) of the Decimal Currency Amendment Act 1965 (1965 No 124).

##### 7 Meaning of ""firm""
    
*   Persons who have entered into partnership with one another are for the purposes of this Act called collectively a ""firm"", and the name under which their business is carried on is called the ""firm name"".
    
    Compare: 1891 No 6 s 7; Partnership Act 1890 s 4 (UK)

#### Relations of partners to persons dealing with them

##### 8 Power of partner to bind the firm
    
*   Every partner is an agent of the firm and his other partners for the purpose of the business of the partnership; and the acts of every partner who does any act for carrying on in the usual way business of the kind carried on by the firm of which he is a member bind the firm and his partners, unless the partner so acting has in fact no authority to act for the firm in the particular matter, and the person with whom he is dealing either knows that he has no authority or does not know or believe him to be a partner.
    
    Compare: 1891 No 6 s 8; Partnership Act 1890 s 5 (UK)

*   An act or instrument relating to the business of the firm, and done or executed in the firm name, or in any other manner showing an intention to bind the firm, by any person thereto authorised, whether a partner or not, is binding on the firm and all the partners:

    Compare: 1891 No 6 s 9; Partnership Act 1890 s 6 (UK)

##### 10 Partner using credit of firm for private purposes
    
*   Where one partner pledges the credit of the firm for a purpose apparently not connected with the firm's ordinary course of business, the firm is not bound unless he is in fact specially authorised by the other partners; but this section does not affect any personal liability incurred by an individual partner.
    
    Compare: 1891 No 6 s 10; Partnership Act 1890 s 7 (UK)

##### 11 Effect of notice that firm will not be bound by acts of partner
    
*   If it has been agreed between the partners that any restriction shall be placed on the power of any one or more of them to bind the firm, no act done in contravention of the agreement is binding on the firm with respect to persons having notice of the agreement.
    
    Compare: 1891 No 6 s 11; Partnership Act 1890 s 8 (UK)

##### 12 Liability of partners
    
*   Every partner in a firm is liable jointly with the other partners for all debts and obligations of the firm incurred while he is a partner; and after his death his estate is also severally liable in a due course of administration for such debts and obligations as far as they remain unsatisfied, but subject to the prior payment of his separate debts.
    
    Compare: 1891 No 6 s 12; Partnership Act 1890 s 9 (UK)

##### 13 Liability of the firm for wrongs
    
*   Where by the wrongful act or omission of any partner acting in the ordinary course of the business of the firm, or with the authority of his co-partners, loss or injury is caused to any person not being a partner in the firm, or any penalty is incurred, the firm is liable therefor to the same extent as the partner so acting or omitting to act.
    
    Compare: 1891 No 6 s 13; Partnership Act 1890 s 10 (UK)

##### 14 Misapplication of money received for firm, etc
    
*   In the following cases, namely,---
        
    *   (a) where one partner acting within the scope of his apparent authority receives the money or property of a third person and misapplies it; and
    
    *   (b) where a firm in the course of its business receives money or property of a third person, and the money or property so received is misapplied by one or more of the partners while it is in the custody of the firm,---
    
    the firm is liable to make good the loss.
    
    Compare: 1891 No 6 s 14; Partnership Act 1890 s 11 (UK)

##### 15 Joint and several liability
    
*   Every partner is liable jointly with his co-partners and also severally for everything for which the firm, while he is a partner therein, becomes liable under either of the 2 last preceding sections.
    
    Compare: 1891 No 6 s 15; Partnership Act 1890 s 12 (UK)

##### 16 Improper employment of trust property for partnership purposes
    
*   If a partner, being a trustee, improperly employs trust property in the business or on the account of the partnership, no other partner is liable for the trust property to the persons beneficially interested therein:
    
    Provided that---
        
    *   (a) this section shall not affect any liability incurred by any partner by reason of his having notice of a breach of trust; and
    
    *   (b) nothing in this section shall prevent trust money from being followed and recovered from the firm if still in its possession or under its control.
    
    Compare: 1891 No 6 s 16; Partnership Act 1890 s 13 (UK)

##### 17 Persons liable by ""holding out""

    (2) Provided that where after a partner's death the partnership business is continued in the old firm name, the continued use of that name or of the deceased partner's name as part thereof shall not of itself make his executors' or administrators' estate or effects liable for any partnership debts contracted after his death.
    
    Compare: 1891 No 6 s 17; Partnership Act 1890 s 14 (UK)

##### 18 Admissions and representations of partners

##### 19 Notice to acting partner to be notice to firm

    Compare: 1891 No 6 s 19; Partnership Act 1890 s 16 (UK)

##### 20 Liabilities of incoming and outgoing partners
    
*   (1) A person who is admitted as a partner into an existing firm does not thereby become liable to the creditors of the firm for anything done before he became a partner.
    
    (2) A partner who retires from a firm does not thereby cease to be liable for partnership debts or obligations incurred before his retirement.
    
    (3) A retiring partner may be discharged from any existing liabilities by an agreement to that effect between himself and the members of the firm as newly constituted and the creditors, and this agreement may be either express or inferred as a fact from the course of dealing between the creditors and the firm as newly constituted.
    
    Compare: 1891 No 6 s 20; Partnership Act 1890 s 17 (UK)

##### 21 Revocation of continuing guaranty by change in firm
    
*   A continuing guaranty given either to a firm or to a third person in respect of the transactions of a firm is, in the absence of agreement to the contrary, revoked as to future transactions by any change in the constitution of the firm to which, or of the firm in respect of the transactions of which, the guaranty was given.
    
    Compare: 1891 No 6 s 21; Partnership Act 1890 s 18 (UK)

##### 23 Partnership property
    
*   (1) All property and rights and interests in property originally brought into the partnership stock, or acquired (whether by purchase or otherwise) on account of the firm or for the purposes and in the course of the partnership business, are called in this Act _partnership property_, and must be held and applied by the partners exclusively for the purposes of the partnership and in accordance with the partnership agreement.
    
    (2) Provided that the legal estate or interest in any land which belongs to the partnership shall devolve according to the nature and tenure thereof and the general rules of law thereto applicable, but in trust, so far as necessary, for the persons beneficially interested in the land under this section.
    
    (3) Where co-owners of an estate or interest in any land not being itself partnership property are partners as to profits made by the use of that land or estate, and purchase other land or estate out of the profits to be used in like manner, the land or estate so purchased belongs to them, in the absence of an agreement to the contrary, not as partners, but as co-owners for the same respective estates and interests as are held by them in the land or estate first mentioned at the date of the purchase.
    
    Compare: 1891 No 6 s 23; Partnership Act 1890 s 20 (UK)

##### 24 Property bought with partnership money

##### 25 Conversion into personal estate of land held as partnership property

    (2) The High Court or a Judge thereof may, on the application by summons of any judgment creditor of a partner, make an order charging that partner's interest in the partnership property and profits with payment of the amount of the judgment debt and interest thereon; and may by the same or a subsequent order appoint a receiver of that partner's share of profits (whether already declared or accruing), and of any other money coming to him in respect of the partnership, and direct all accounts and inquiries and give all other orders and directions which might have been directed or given if the charge had been made in favour of the judgment creditor by the partner, or which the circumstances of the case require.
    
    (2A) On the application of any judgment creditor who has obtained in, or removed into, the District Court a judgment, order, or decree for the payment of a sum of money, a District Court may make any order that may be made by the High Court under this section.
