*   (1) Applications for the protection of inventions in any of the Contracting States may be filed as international applications under this Treaty.

*   (2) An international application shall contain, as specified in this Treaty and the Regulations, a request, a description, one or more claims, one or more drawings (where required), and an abstract.

*   (3) The abstract merely serves the purpose of technical information and cannot be taken into account for any other purpose, particularly not for the purpose of interpreting the scope of the protection sought.

*   (4) The international application shall:
        
    *   (i) be in a prescribed language;
    
    *   (ii) comply with the prescribed physical requirements;
    
    *   (iii) comply with the prescribed requirement of unity of invention;
    
    *   (iv) be subject to the payment of the prescribed fees.

*   (2) Every designation shall be subject to the payment of the prescribed fee within the prescribed time limit.

*   (3) Unless the applicant asks for any of the other kinds of protection referred to in Article 43, designation shall mean that the desired protection consists of the grant of a patent by or for the designated State. For the purposes of this paragraph, Article 2(ii) shall not apply.

*   (4) Failure to indicate in the request the name and other prescribed data concerning the inventor shall have no consequence in any designated State whose national law requires the furnishing of the said indications but allows that they be furnished at a time later than that of the filing of a national application.

The agreement shall specify the rights and obligations of the parties, in particular, the formal undertaking by the said Office or organization to apply and observe all the common rules of international search.

*   (c) The Regulations prescribe the minimum requirements, particularly as to manpower and documentation, which any Office or organization must satisfy before it can be appointed and must continue to satisfy while it remains appointed.

*   (d) Appointment shall be for a fixed period of time and may be extended for further periods.

    *   (ii) that the description, the claims, or the drawings, fail to comply with the prescribed requirements to such an extent that a meaningful search could not be carried out,
    
    the said Authority shall so declare and shall notify the applicant and the International Bureau that no international search report will be established.

*   (b) If any of the situations referred to in subparagraph (a) is found to exist in connection with certain claims only, the international search report shall so indicate in respect of such claims, whereas, for the other claims, the said report shall be established as provided in Article 18\.

The International Searching Authority shall establish the international search report on those parts of the international application which relate to the invention first mentioned in the claims (""main invention"") and, provided the required additional fees have been paid within the prescribed time limit, on those parts of the international application which relate to inventions in respect of which the said fees were paid.

*   (b) The national law of any designated State may provide that, where the national Office of that State finds the invitation, referred to in subparagraph (a), of the International Searching Authority justified and where the applicant has not paid all additional fees, those parts of the international application which consequently have not been searched shall, as far as effects in that State are concerned, be considered withdrawn unless a special fee is paid by the applicant to the national Office of that State.

He may, at the same time, file a brief statement, as provided in the Regulations, explaining the amendments and indicating any impact that such amendments might have on the description and the drawings.

*   (2) The amendments shall not go beyond the disclosure in the international application as filed.

*   (b) The communication shall include the translation (as prescribed) of the said report or declaration.

*   (2) If the claims have been amended by virtue of Article 19(1), the communication shall either contain the full text of the claims both as filed and as amended or shall contain the full text of the claims as filed and specify the amendments, and shall include the statement, if any, referred to in Article 19(1).

*   (1) No national law shall require compliance with requirements relating to the form or contents of the international application different from or additional to those which are provided for in this Treaty and the Regulations.

*   (2) The provisions of paragraph (1) neither affect the application of the provisions of Article 7(2) nor preclude any national law from requiring, once the processing of the international application has started in the designated Office, the furnishing:
        
    *   (i) when the applicant is a legal entity, of the name of an officer entitled to represent such legal entity,
    
    *   (ii) of documents not part of the international application but which constitute proof of allegations or statements made in that application, including the confirmation of the international application by the signature of the applicant when that application, as filed, was signed by his representative or agent.
    
    

*   (3) Where the applicant, for the purposes of any designated State, is not qualified according to the national law of that State to file a national application because he is not the inventor, the international application may be rejected by the designated Office.

*   (4) Where the national law provides, in respect of the form or contents of national applications, for requirements which, from the viewpoint of applicants, are more favorable than the requirements provided for by this Treaty and the Regulations in respect of international applications, the national Office, the courts and any other competent organs of or acting for the designated State may apply the former requirements, instead of the latter requirements, to international applications, except where the applicant insists that the requirements provided for by this Treaty and the Regulations be applied to his international application.

*   (5) Nothing in this Treaty and the Regulations is intended to be construed as prescribing anything that would limit the freedom of each Contracting State to prescribe such substantive conditions of patentability as it desires. In particular, any provision in this Treaty and the Regulations concerning the definition of prior art is exclusively for the purposes of the international procedure and, consequently, any Contracting State is free to apply, when determining the patentability of an invention claimed in an international application, the criteria of its national law in respect of prior art and other conditions of patentability not constituting requirements as to the form and contents of applications.

*   (6) The national law may require that the applicant furnish evidence in respect of any substantive condition of patentability prescribed by such law.

*   (7) Any receiving Office or, once the processing of the international application has started in the designated Office, that Office may apply the national law as far as it relates to any requirement that the applicant be represented by an agent having the right to represent applicants before the said Office and/or that the applicant have an address in the designated State for the purpose of receiving notifications.

*   (8) Nothing in this Treaty and the Regulations is intended to be construed as limiting the freedom of any Contracting State to apply measures deemed necessary for the preservation of its national security or to limit, for the protection of the general economic interests of that State, the right of its own residents or nationals to file international applications.

### Article 28---Amendment of the Claims, the Description, and the Drawings, before Designated Offices
    
*   (1) The applicant shall be given the opportunity to amend the claims, the description, and the drawings, before each designated Office within the prescribed time limit. No designated Office shall grant a patent, or refuse the grant of a patent, before such time limit has expired except with the express consent of the applicant.

*   (2) The amendments shall not go beyond the disclosure in the international application as filed unless the national law of the designated State permits them to go beyond the said disclosure.

*   (3) The amendments shall be in accordance with the national law of the designated State in all respects not provided for in this Treaty and the Regulations.

*   (4) Where the designated Office requires a translation of the international application, the amendments shall be in the language of the translation.

### Article 29---Effects of the International Publication
    
*   (1) As far as the protection of any rights of the applicant in a designated State is concerned, the effects, in that State, of the international publication of an international application shall, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (2) to (4), be the same as those which the national law of the designated State provides for the compulsory national publication of unexamined national applications as such.

*   (2) If the language in which the international publication has been effected is different from the language in which publications under the national law are effected in the designated State, the said national law may provide that the effects provided for in paragraph (1) shall be applicable only from such time as:
        
    *   (i) a translation into the latter language has been published as provided by the national law, or
    
    *   (ii) a translation into the latter language has been made available to the public, by laying open for public inspection as provided by the national law, or
    
    *   (iii) a translation into the latter language has been transmitted by the applicant to the actual or prospective unauthorized user of the invention claimed in the international application, or
    
    *   (iv) both the acts described in (i) and (iii), or both the acts described in (ii) and (iii), have taken place.
    
    

*   (3) The national law of any designated State may provide that, where the international publication has been effected, on the request of the applicant, before the expiration of 18 months from the priority date, the effects provided for in paragraph (1) shall be applicable only from the expiration of 18 months from the priority date.

*   (4) The national law of any designated State may provide that the effects provided for in paragraph (1) shall be applicable only from the date on which a copy of the international application as published under Article 21 has been received in the national Office of or acting for such State. The said Office shall publish the date of receipt in its gazette as soon as possible.

### Article 30---Confidential Nature of the International Application
    
*   (1)(a) Subject to the provisions of subparagraph (b), the International Bureau and the International Searching Authorities shall not allow access by any person or authority to the international application before the international publication of that application, unless requested or authorized by the applicant.

    *   (ii) date of the receipt of the communication of the international application under Article 20,
    
    *   (iii) date of the receipt of a copy of the international application under Article 22\.
    
    

*   (b) The provisions of subparagraph (a) shall not prevent any national Office from informing third parties that it has been designated, or from publishing that fact. Such information or publication may, however, contain only the following data: identification of the receiving Office, name of the applicant, international filing date, international application number, and title of the invention.

*   (c) The provisions of subparagraph (a) shall not prevent any designated Office from allowing access to the international application for the purposes of the judicial authorities.

*   (3) The provisions of paragraph (2)(a) shall apply to any receiving Office except as far as transmittals provided for under Article 12(1) are concerned.

*   (4) For the purposes of this Article, the term ""access"" covers any means by which third parties may acquire cognizance, including individual communication and general publication, provided, however, that no national Office shall generally publish an international application or its translation before the international publication or, if international publication has not taken place by the expiration of 20 months from the priority date, before the expiration of 20 months from the said priority date.

*   (3) The provisions of Article 16(3) shall apply, _murtatis mutandis_, in respect of International Preliminary Examining Authorities.

### Article 33---The International Preliminary Examination
    
*   (1) The objective of the international preliminary examination is to formulate a preliminary and non-binding opinion on the questions whether the claimed invention appears to be novel, to involve an inventive step (to be non-obvious), and to be industrially applicable.

*   (2) For the purposes of the international preliminary examination, a claimed invention shall be considered novel if it is not anticipated by the prior art as defined in the Regulations.

*   (3) For the purposes of the international preliminary examination, a claimed invention shall be considered to involve an inventive step if, having regard to the prior art as defined in the Regulations, it is not, at the prescribed relevant date, obvious to a person skilled in the art.

*   (4) For the purposes of the international preliminary examination, a claimed invention shall be considered industrially applicable if, according to its nature, it can be made or used (in the technological sense) in any kind of industry. ""Industry"" shall be understood in its broadest sense, as in the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property.

    *   (i) the invention satisfies the criteria set forth in Article 33(1),
    
    *   (ii) the international application complies with the requirements of this Treaty and the Regulations in so far as checked by that Authority,
    
    *   (iii) no observations are intended to be made under Article 35(2), last sentence.

    *   (i) that the international application relates to a subject matter on which the International Preliminary Examining Authority is not required, under the Regulations, to carry out an international preliminary examination, and in the particular case decides not to carry out such examination, or
    
    *   (ii) that the description, the claims, or the drawings, are so unclear, or the claims are so inadequately supported by the description, that no meaningful opinion can be formed on the novelty, inventive step (non-obviousness), or industrial applicability, of the claimed invention,
    
    the said Authority shall not go into the questions referred to in Article 33(1) and shall inform the applicant of this opinion and the reasons therefor.

*   (b) If any of the situations referred to in subparagraph (a) is found to exist in, or in connection with, certain claims only, the provisions of that subparagraph shall apply only to the said claims.

    *   (ii) the date on which the earlier application was filed,
    
    the priority claim shall, for the purposes of the procedure under the Treaty, be considered not to have been made. However, where, resulting from an obvious error, the indication of the said country or the said date is missing or is erroneous, the receiving Office may, at the request of the applicant, make the necessary correction. The error shall be considered as an obvious error whenever the correction is obvious from a comparison with the earlier application. Where the error consists of the omission of the indication of the said date, the correction can only be made before the transmittal of the record copy to the International Bureau. In the case of any other error relating to the indication of the said date or in the case of any error relating to the indication of the said country, the correction can only be made before the expiration of the time limit under Rule 17.1(a) computed on the basis of the correct priority date.

Such reference shall either identify the application (or its translation, as the case may be) in respect of which the earlier search was made by indicating country, date and number, or the said search by indicating, where applicable, date and number of the request for such search.

##### 4.12 Choice of Certain Kinds of Protection
    
*   (a) If the applicant wishes his international application to be treated, in any designated State, as an application not for a patent but for the grant of any of the other kinds of protection specified in Article 43, he shall so indicate in the request. For the purposes of this paragraph, Article 2(ii) shall not apply.

    *   (i) specify the technical field to which the invention relates;
    
    *   (ii) indicate the background art which, as far as known to the applicant, can be regarded as useful for the understanding, searching and examination of the invention, and, preferably, cite the documents reflecting such art;
    
    *   (iii) disclose the invention, as claimed, in such terms that the technical problem (even if not expressly stated as such) and its solution can be understood, and state the advantageous effects, if any, of the invention with reference to the background art;
    
    *   (iv) briefly describe the figures in the drawings, if any;
    
    *   (v) set forth at least the best mode contemplated by the applicant for carrying out the invention claimed; this shall be done in terms of examples, where appropriate, and with reference to the drawings, if any; where the national law of the designated State does not require the description of the best mode but is satisfied with the description of any mode (whether it is the best contemplated or not), failure to describe the best mode contemplated shall have no effect in that State;
    
    *   (vi) indicate explicitly, when it is not obvious from the description or nature of the invention, the way in which the invention is capable of exploitation in industry and the way in which it can be made and used, or, if it can only be used, the way in which it can be used; the term ""industry"" is to be understood in its broadest sense as in the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property.
    
    

*   (b) The manner and order specified in paragraph (a) shall be followed except when, because of the nature of the invention, a different manner or a different order would result in a better understanding and a more economic presentation.

*   (c) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (b), each of the parts referred to in paragraph (a) shall preferably be preceded by an appropriate heading as suggested in the Administrative Instructions.

##### 5.2 Nucleotide and/or Amino Acid Sequence Disclosure

Where the international application contains disclosure of a nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence, the description shall contain a listing of the sequence complying with the standard prescribed by the Administrative Instructions.

### Rule 6---The Claims

##### 6.1 Number and Numbering of Claims
    
*   (a) The number of the claims shall be reasonable in consideration of the nature of the invention claimed.

*   (b) If there are several claims, they shall be numbered consecutively in Arabic numerals.

##### 6.2 References to Other Parts of the International Application
    
*   (a) Claims shall not, except where absolutely necessary, rely, in respect of the technical features of the invention, on references to the description or drawings. In particular, they shall not rely on such references as: ""as described in part ... of the description,"" or ""as illustrated in figure ... of the drawings.""

*   (b) Where the international application contains drawings, the technical features mentioned in the claims shall preferably be followed by the reference signs relating to such features. When used, the reference signs shall preferably be placed between parentheses. If inclusion of reference signs does not particularly facilitate quicker understanding of a claim, it should not be made. Reference signs may be removed by a designated Office for the purposes of publication by such Office.

##### 6.3 Manner of Claiming
    
*   (a) The definition of the matter for which protection is sought shall be in terms of the technical features of the invention.

*   (b) Whenever appropriate, claims shall contain:
        
    *   (i) a statement indicating those technical features of the invention which are necessary for the definition of the claimed subject matter but which, in combination, are part of the prior art,
    
    *   (ii) a characterizing portion---preceded by the words ""characterized in that,"" ""characterized by,"" ""wherein the improvement comprises,"" or any other words to the same effect---stating concisely the technical features which, in combination with the features stated under (i), it is desired to protect.
    
    

*   (c) Where the national law of the designated State does not require the manner of claiming provided for in paragraph (b), failure to use that manner of claiming shall have no effect in that State provided the manner of claiming actually used satisfies the national law of that State.

##### 6.4 Dependent Claims
    
*   (a) Any claim which includes all the features of one or more other claims (claim in dependent form, hereinafter referred to as ""dependent claim"") shall do so by a reference, if possible at the beginning, to the other claim or claims and shall then state the additional features claimed. Any dependent claim which refers to more than one other claim (""multiple dependent claim"") shall refer to such claims in the alternative only. Multiple dependent claims shall not serve as a basis for any other multiple dependent claim. Where the national law of the national Office acting as International Searching Authority does not allow multiple dependent claims to be drafted in a manner different from that provided for in the preceding two sentences, failure to use that manner of claiming may result in an indication under Article 17(2)(b) in the international search report. Failure to use the said manner of claiming shall have no effect in a designated State if the manner of claiming actually used satisfies the national law of that State.

*   (b) Any dependent claim shall be construed as including all the limitations contained in the claim to which it refers or, if the dependent claim is a multiple dependent claim, all the limitations contained in the particular claim in relation to which it is considered.

*   (c) All dependent claims referring back to a single previous claim, and all dependent claims referring back to several previous claims, shall be grouped together to the extent and in the most practical way possible.

##### 6.5 Utility Models

Any designated State in which the grant of a utility model is sought on the basis of an international application may, instead of Rules 6.1 to 6.4, apply in respect of the matters regulated in those Rules the provisions of its national law concerning utility models once the processing of the international application has started in that State, provided that the applicant shall be allowed at least two months from the expiration of the time limit applicable under Article 22 to adapt his application to the requirements of the said provisions of the national law.

*   (e) Claims relating to inventions in respect of which no international search report has been established need not be the subject of international preliminary examination.

##### 66.2 First Written Opinion of the International Preliminary Examining Authority
    
*   (a) If the International Preliminary Examining Authority
        
    *   (i) considers that any of the situations referred to in Article 34(4) exists,
    
    *   (ii) considers that the international preliminary examination report should be negative in respect of any of the claims because the invention claimed therein does not appear to be novel, does not appear to involve an inventive step (does not appear to be non-obvious), or does not appear to be industrially applicable,
    
    *   (iii) notices that there is some defect in the form or contents of the international application under the Treaty or these Regulations,
    
    *   (iv) considers that any amendment goes beyond the disclosure in the international application as filed,
    
    *   (v) wishes to accompany the international preliminary examination report by observations on the clarity of the claims, the description, and the drawings, or the question whether the claims are fully supported by the description,
    
    *   (vi) considers that a claim relates to an invention in respect of which no international search report has been established and has decided not to carry out the international preliminary examination in respect of that claim, or
    
    *   (vii) considers that a nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence listing is not available to it in such a form that a meaningful international preliminary examination can be carried out,
    
    the said Authority shall notify the applicant accordingly in writing. Where the national law of the national Office acting as International Preliminary Examining Authority does not allow multiple dependent claims to be drafted in a manner different from that provided for in the second and third sentences of Rule 6.4(a), the International Preliminary Examining Authority may, in case of failure to use that manner of claiming, apply Article 34(4)(b). In such case, it shall notify the applicant accordingly in writing.

*   (b) The notification shall fully state the reasons for the opinion of the International Preliminary Examining Authority.

*   (c) The notification shall invite the applicant to submit a written reply together, where appropriate, with amendments.

*   (d) The notification shall fix a time limit for the reply. The time limit shall be reasonable under the circumstances. It shall normally be two months after the date of notification. In no case shall it be shorter than one month after the said date.

It shall not be more than three months after the said date but may be extended if the applicant so requests before its expiration.

*   (a) The applicant may respond to the invitation referred to in Rule 66.2(c) of the International Preliminary Examining Authority by making amendments or --- if he disagrees with the opinion of that Authority --- by submitting arguments, as the case may be, or do both.

## Part 5  
Administrative and miscellaneous provisions

### Subpart 6---Repeals, amendments, validation, and saving and transitional provisions

#### Transitional provisions for patents and patent applications

##### 253 Outline of transitional provisions for patents
    
*   (1) The general scheme and effect of the transitional provisions for patents on and from the commencement of Part 3 of this Act (**commencement**) is as follows:
        
    *   (a) this Act applies to patents granted under the Patents Act 1953 (but patents retain their existing key dates, term, and grounds for revocation):
    
    *   (b) patent applications made under the Patents Act 1953 continue to be dealt with under that Act unless a complete specification is filed on or after commencement and, in this case, the complete specification may be filed only under this Act and this Act then applies to the patent application:
    
    *   (c) Treaty applications---
            
        *   (i) continue to be dealt with under the Patents Act 1953 if the applicant has fulfilled the applicant's obligations under Article 22(1) or 39(1)(a) of the Patent Cooperation Treaty before commencement; and
        
        *   (ii) must be dealt with under this Act if the applicant did not fulfil those obligations before that time:
        
        
    
    *   (d) there are particular transitional provisions for post-dated applications and divisional applications.
    
    (2) This section is a guide only to the general scheme and effect of the transitional provisions for patents.

##### 254 Transitional provision for patents granted under Patents Act 1953
    
*   (1) This Act applies to a patent granted under the Patents Act 1953 as if it were granted under this Act.
    
    (2) However,---
        
    *   (a) the patent retains its original date of filing of the patent application, patent date (that is the date of filing of the complete specification), priority date or dates, date of the publication of the accepted complete specification, date that the patent was granted, and date that the next renewal fee was due under the Patents Act 1953; and
    
    *   (b) the patent retains its existing term; and
    
    *   (c) the next renewal fee (after this section comes into force) must be paid when due in accordance with the Patents Act 1953 but, after that due date, renewal fees become due in accordance with this Act; and
    
    *   (d) on a re-examination of the patent application and the complete specification under section 95, the grounds that a person may specify in a request for re-examination, and that the Commissioner may consider and report on, are the grounds in section 41(1) of the Patents Act 1953 (rather than the grounds in section 114 of this Act); and
    
    *   (e) the Commissioner or the court may revoke the patent under this Act only on the grounds set out in section 41(1) or (3) of the Patents Act 1953, and those grounds are available as grounds of defence in a proceeding for the infringement of the patent (rather than the grounds in section 114 of this Act); and
    
    *   (f) section 146 of this Act does not apply; and
    
    *   (g) in relation to any existing endorsement of the patent under section 44 of the Patents Act 1953,---
            
        *   (i) the repeals in section 247 do not affect the endorsement; and
        
        *   (ii) sections 44 and 45 of the Patents Act 1953 continue to apply to the patent for the purposes of the endorsement, as if sections 247 to 249 were not in force (and accordingly, renewal fees remain at one-half of the fees otherwise payable under this Act while the patent is so endorsed).
        
        
    
    

##### 255 Patent applications made under Patents Act 1953 continue under that Act
    
*   (1) The Patents Act 1953 (and the regulations, orders, directions, and other matters made under it) continues to apply, as if sections 247 to 249 were not in force, for the purposes of---
        
    *   (a) a patent application made under that Act before the commencement of Part 3 of this Act:
    
    *   (b) the bringing and completion of any application, request, notice, or other proceeding relating to that application (whether commenced before or after the commencement of Part 3 of this Act).
    
    (2) Any reference in any other enactment to a repealed provision of the Patents Act 1953 (or a revoked provision of any regulations made under it) continues to apply for the purposes of subsection (1) as if the reference had not been repealed or amended by this Act.
    
    (3) Section 254 applies to any patent granted under the Patents Act 1953 in respect of that application.
    
    (4) This section is subject to sections 256, 257, and 259\.

##### 256 Patents Act 1953 ceases to apply to patent application if complete specification later filed
    
*   (1) Despite section 255,---
        
    *   (a) a complete specification may not be filed under the Patents Act 1953 on or after the commencement of Part 3 of this Act (unless section 258 applies to the complete specification); and
    
    *   (b) the complete specification must instead comply with, and be filed under, this Act; and
    
    *   (c) on and from the date on which the complete specification is filed, this Act applies in respect of the patent application (and any application, request, notice, or other proceeding relating to it) as if it were made under this Act (including as to the priority date).
    
    (2) Subsection (1) applies whether the complete specification is filed for one of the following reasons or any other reason:
        
    *   (a) only a provisional specification was filed before that commencement; or
    
    *   (b) the original complete specification was directed (whether before or after that commencement) to be treated as a provisional specification under section 9(4) of the Patents Act 1953\.
    
    (3) If a complete specification is provided for 2 or more patent applications that are cognate or of which one is a modification of another, this section applies to those 2 or more patent applications.

##### 257 This Act applies if patent application under Patents Act 1953 is post-dated
    
*   If a patent application made under the Patents Act 1953 is post-dated to a date that is on or after the commencement of Part 3 of this Act, this Act applies to the patent application as if the patent application had been made under this Act.

##### 258 Patents Act 1953 applies to divisional applications dated before commencement
    
*   (1) This section applies to a fresh patent application that is made on or after the commencement of Part 3 of this Act (and any complete specification that is filed at the same time) if---
        
    *   (a) the fresh patent application is made for any part of the subject matter of a patent application to which the Patents Act 1953 applies under section 255 or 259; and
    
    *   (b) the fresh patent application is given a date before that commencement.
    
    (2) The fresh patent application must be treated as a patent application made under the Patents Act 1953 (and section 255 applies to it) and the complete specification must be treated as having been filed on the date given to the fresh patent application.

##### 259 Which Act applies to Treaty applications
    
*   (1) The Patents Act 1953 (and the regulations, orders, directions, and other matters made under it) continues to apply, as if sections 247 to 249 were not in force, for the purposes of---
        
    *   (a) a Treaty application if the applicant fulfilled the applicant's obligations under Article 22(1) or 39(1)(a) of the Patent Cooperation Treaty before the commencement of Part 3 of this Act:
    
    *   (b) the bringing and completion of any application, request, notice, or other proceeding relating to that application (whether commenced before or after the commencement of Part 3 of this Act).
    
    (2) Any reference in any other enactment to a repealed provision of the Patents Act 1953 (or a revoked provision of any regulations made under it) continues to apply for the purposes of subsection (1) as if the reference had not been repealed or amended by this Act.
    
    (3) Section 254 applies to any patent granted under the Patents Act 1953 in respect of that application.
    
    (4) However, this Act applies to a Treaty application if the applicant did not fulfil those obligations before the commencement of Part 3\.

#### Transitional provisions for other applications, notices, and requests

##### 260 Transitional provision for other applications, notices, or requests
    
*   (1) The Patents Act 1953 (and the regulations, orders, directions, and other matters made under it) continues to apply, as if sections 247 to 249 were not in force, for the purposes of completing any application, notice, or request that was received by the Commissioner or the court, or completing any other proceeding commenced, before the commencement of Part 3 of this Act.
    
    (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to a patent application, or an application, notice, request, or other proceeding relating to a patent application, to which any of sections 255 to 259 apply.
    
    (3) If the Patents Act 1953 continues to apply to an application, notice, or request under this section, any reference in any other enactment to a repealed provision of the Patents Act 1953 (or a revoked provision of any regulations made under it) continues to apply for that purpose as if the reference had not been repealed or amended by this Act.

#### Transitional provision for matters in force on commencement

##### 261 Transitional provision for orders, directions, and other matters in effect on transition to new law
    
*   (1) Any order, direction, or other matter made under a repealed provision of the Patents Act 1953, and that is in effect immediately before its transition takes effect under subsection (3), continues to have effect as if it had been made under the provision of this Act---

    *   (b) under which it could be made.
    
    (2) The order, direction, or other matter may be amended or revoked as if it had been made under the provision of this Act that replaces, or that corresponds to, the provision of the Patents Act 1953 under which it was made.
