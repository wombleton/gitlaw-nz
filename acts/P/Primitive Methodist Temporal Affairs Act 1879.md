An Act to regulate the Temporal Affairs of the Religious Society denominated Primitive Methodists.
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    WHEREAS in or about the year one thousand eight hundred and forty-four a society of the Primitive Methodist Connexion was duly established at New Plymouth, in the Colony of New Zealand, by the late Reverend Robert Ward, under and by virtue of the powers and privileges delegated to him in that behalf by the Conference of the said Connexion duly held at Lynn Regis, in the County of Norfolk, in England, in the year one thousand eight hundred and forty-four: And whereas it is expedient to make provision for creating a succession of properly-qualified trustees according, as nearly as may be to the usages and regulations of the said Connexion as declared and set forth in the deed poll and model deed of the said Connexion, and for defining as nearly as may be the manner in which the trusts affecting any property of the said Connexion may be fulfilled, and generally for the conduct of the temporal affairs of the said Connexion and the management of any property thereof:

BE IT THEREFORE ENACTED by the General Assembly of New Zealand in Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:---

##### 1 Short Title
    
*   The Short Title of this Act is The Primitive Methodist Temporal Affairs Act 1879\.

##### 2 Election of trustees
    
*   From and after the passing of this Act the trustees of all Primitive Methodist churches, chapels, ministers' dwellings, schoolrooms, burial-grounds, glebe lands, or other property in the Colony of New Zealand, shall be elected and appointed in manner following, that is to say: A special meeting of the minister or ministers, the leader or leaders of the classes, the society stewards, the members of the quarterly meeting, and any such other persons as the station committee may appoint, shall be convened by the superintendent minister of the station for the time being within whose jurisdiction such church, chapel, school, or minister's dwelling is intended to be built, or where the burial-ground or glebe land or other land or property belonging to the said Connexion shall be situated, and the persons composing such meeting or the majority of them shall put in nomination any number of persons not less than five or more than ten, being members of or friendly to the said Primitive Methodist Connexion.

##### 3 Time and place of meeting to be notified
    
*   The time and place for holding every such meeting as aforesaid shall be publicly notified in the church or chapel, or the usual place of worship, in which the said meeting is to be held, during the time of Divine service on the Sunday preceding the said intended meeting.

##### 4 Nominations to be submitted to station's quarterly meeting
    
*   The superintendent minister shall lay such nomination as aforesaid before the ensuing quarterly meeting of the station as aforesaid for its approval, and, in the event of the non-approval thereof by such quarterly meeting, then such election shall take place _de novo_, and so on from time to time until such approval be obtained.

##### 5 Superintendent minister entitled to attend meetings and vote
    
*   The superintendent minister for the time being, lawfully appointed and recognized by the Annual District Meeting or Conference of the said Primitive Methodist Connexion in the colony aforesaid as the superintendent minister of the station as aforesaid, shall, _ex officio_, be entitled to be present at and to take part in the proceedings of and have a vote at all meetings of the trustees, or other meetings concerning the affairs of the church, chapel, minister's dwelling, school, or other property of the said circuit or station.

##### 6 In his absence his colleagues may do so
    
*   In case the said superintendent minister shall be unable to attend such meeting, his colleague, or any one of his colleagues in the ministry belonging to the same station with himself, being nominated by such superintendent minister, shall be entitled to be present and to take part in the proceedings of and have a vote at all such meetings as aforesaid, in like manner as the said superintendent minister might have acted and voted if personally present; and no such meeting shall be held without one of the said ministers being present thereat.

##### 7 Proceedings at meetings
    
*   At any meeting held under or by virtue of this Act the persons present at such meeting and entitled to vote thereat, or the majority of them, shall choose a chairman or president of such meeting, and shall decide any question or matter proposed at such meeting and respecting which votes shall be given: And, in case the votes shall be equally divided, then the chairman or president of such meeting shall give the casting vote, which casting vote he shall have in addition to the vote he shall be otherwise entitled to; and all acts and deeds done and executed in pursuance of any such decision as aforesaid shall be good and valid and binding on all persons entitled to vote at the meeting who may be absent, or, being present, may be in the minority; but no person (unless where the contrary is hereinbefore expressly mentioned) shall be allowed to vote in more than one capacity at the same time or on the same question, although holding more than one office at the same time in the said Primitive Methodist Connexion or in the same meeting.

##### 8 Trust property to vest in trustees and their successors
    
*   Whenever any freehold, leasehold, or other property has been acquired or hereafter shall be acquired by or on behalf of the Primitive Methodist Connexion or any society thereof, or subject to any trust for the said Primitive Methodist Connexion or any society thereof, or for individuals composing the same, such conveyance, assignment, or other assurance shall not only vest the freehold or leasehold or other property thereby conveyed, assigned, or otherwise assured, in the party or parties named therein, but shall also effectually vest such freehold or leasehold or other property in their successors in office for the time being and the old continuing trustees, if any, jointly, or, if there be no old continuing trustees, then in such successors for the time being solely chosen and appointed in the manner provided or referred to in or by this Act, or in or by such conveyance, assignment, or other assurance, or in any separate deed or instrument declaring the trust thereof, upon such and the like trusts, and with and under and subject to the same powers and provisions as are contained or referred to in such conveyance or assignment or other assurance, or in any such separate deed or instrument upon which such property is held, and that without any transfer, assignment, conveyance or other assurance whatsoever, anything in such conveyance, assignment, or other assurance, or in any separate deed or instrument contained to the contrary notwithstanding: Provided always that in case of any appointment of a new trustee or trustees, or of the conveyance of the legal estate in any such property being made as hereinbefore was by law required, the same shall be valid and effectual to all intents and purposes as if this Act had not been passed.
