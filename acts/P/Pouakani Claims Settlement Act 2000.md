*   #### Preamble
    
    ##### He kōrero tāhuhu
    
    (1) E mau ake nei te Rārangi Tāpiri Tuatahi mō tēnei ture, e whakaūpoko ana i roto i te reo Māori me te reo Pākehā i ngā tikanga o [te Tiriti o Waitangi][74]:
    
    ###### Te tono i raro i te Ture o te Tiriti o Waitangi 1975
    
    (2) Ko te tono a te iwi o Pouakani, he mea rēhita ki te Rōpū Whakamana i te Tiriti, i te tau 1987, i raro i te Wai 33, ka mutu, ko tāna, e whai utunga ana mō ngā mamae i pā ki te iwi. Ko te tono nei i whakatakotoria e John Hanita Paki mōna, mō ngā Kaitiaki, mōte hunga hoki e whai pānga atu ana ki ngā whenua tōpū e kīia nei ko Titiraupenga rāua ko Pouakani B9B. I rongohia te tono i waenganui i ngā marama o Mei, o Oketopa o te tau 1989, ā, i putaina e te Rōpū Whakamana i te Tiriti tana pūrongo i te tau 1993\.
    
    ###### Ngā kitenga a te Rōpū Whakamana i te Tiriti
    
    (3) I kitea e te Rōpū Whakamana i te Tiriti---
        
    *   (a) i te tau 1889, kāore anō kia whakataungia e te Kōti Whenua Māori te ripa tauārai o te poraka whenua o Maraeroa 1887, nā te mea kāore i whāia ngā tikanga o te Ture Whenua Māori 1880 i te wā o te whakahau nei. Nā reira i whakatauhia e te Rōpū Whakamana i te Tiriti, ko te rūri whenua a Stubbing i te tau 1892 mō te ripa tauārai i waenganui o ngā poraka whenua o Maraeroa me Pouakani, he mea āta takoto ki te mahere ML6406 me ngā mahere i whai, koia te mea tika:
    
    *   (b) he rahi te whenua (tae atu ki te Poraka 1 o Pouakani) i riro e te Karauna hei ea i ngā utu rūri, ā, tāpiri atu ki ēnei whenua, i riro ngāpānga whenua a tēnā, a tēnā tangata kotahi. Ko te mate kē, i ētahi wā, kāore i tika te rūri, ā, kāore i whiwhi ngā Māori ki te taitara tika:
    
    *   (c) i tā rātou whakatau, arā, kāore he hē i raro i te ture, kāore hoki he mahi rerekē i roto i ngā kaupapa whitiwhiti o te wā e pā ana ki ngā mahi hokohoko o ngā Poraka o Pouakani me Maraeroa i ngā tekau tau 1880--89 me 1890--99, i rangona tonu e te Rōpū Whakamana i te Tiriti ngā mamae me ngākōmuhumuhu o ngā Māori:
    
    *   (d) he nui noa atu tērāi utua e te iwi Māori i te whakanohotanga i te Pākehā ki konei, engari, iti noa te wāhi i whakaritea mōna i te taha ki ngā painga tērā ka hua i te urunga mai o ngā manene me ārātou haupū rawa. Ka tika te kōrero, he nui ngā raruraru i hau mai i ngā mahi a te Kōti Whenua Māori, i tā rātou momo rangahau ko wai te hunga e whai pānga atu ana ki ngā whenua, i tā rātou turaki i te mana o ngā whānau, hapū, iwi, ka hoatu ki te tangata kotahi. Mā ēnei mahi, e taea ai ngā whenua te hokona, pēnei i te manu e timo nei i te kai. Ko ngā raruraru maha i pā ki te hapū, ki te iwi, arā, ko ngā tohetohe mana whenua, roherohe whenua, ko te nui o ngā utu i ūtaina, ko te hē o ētahi mahi rūri, ko te kore rūria o ētahi whenua, ko te nui o te utu ki ngā tono ki te ture:
    
    *   (e) kua takotoria he take tūmatanui e kī ana he nui rawa te whenua i murua e te Karauna hei ea i ngā utu rūri me ētahi atu utu i roto i te Rohe Pōtae. I whakaae anō te Rōpū Whakamana i te Tiriti mā te rangahau tonu i te take nei, ka kitea tōna tino kōrero:
    
    *   (f) nō te mea kāore i rūria ngā ripa tauārai i raro i ngā Whakahau Taitara 1891 i tūria ai ngā poraka whenua o Pouakani B9 (Pureora) rāua ko Pouakani C1 (Kaiwha), ko te tikanga, kāore aua tono roherohenga whenua e taea te whakaurua ki te Tari Whiti Whenua (Land Transfer Office), ā, kāore hoki e taea aua whenua te rēhitatia. I te tau 1899, i runga i te tono a te Karauna, i rūria ētahi ripa tauārai hou e te Kōti Whenua Māori, kātahi ka wehea ngā whenua ki te Karauna me ngā Māori kāore i hoko i ō rātou pānga whenua. I te tau 1899, i utua e ngā tāngata nō rātou te whenua e 343 eka hei ea i ngā mahi rūri o ngā tau ki muri. Engari, nā te mea kāore i oti pai taua mahi rūri, i te roanga ake o te wā, i kitea te hua kore o te tuku whenua mō te rūri. E tika ana te kōrero whānui e kī ana, he kawenga tā te Karauna kia oti pai ngā mahi rūri i ngā ripa tauārai; i tua atu, me utu paremata te Karauna ki ngā tāngata Māori nō rātou te whenua, mō te ngoikore o ngā mahi rūri a Te Tari Rūri o Ākarana (Auckland Survey Office) i te tekau tau 1890--99; anā, nā ēnei mahi, i uru atu ngā Māori nō rātou te whenua o Pouakani B9B ki ngā tautohe kōti nui rawa atu te utu:
    
    *   (g) i kitea i roto i ngā tau ki muri, kāore i whakaaro nuitia te taha Māori i roto i ngā whakahaere a te Karauna i te ngahere e kīia nei ināianei ko Te Ngahere Pāka o Pureora, ahakoa hei tā ngā iwi kāinga kī ai, he taonga te ngahere nei:
    
    ###### Ngā kitenga a te Kōti Whenua Māori
    
    (4) I te tau 1996, i puta te whakatau a te Kōti Whenua Māori e kī ana, he mea takahia e te whakahau a te Kōti Whenua Māori o te tau 1891 e pā ana ki te ripa tauārai o Pouakani / Maraeroa, i te Ture Whakatikatika i Ngā Ture a te Kōti Whenua Māori 1889\. Nā reira, ko te ripa tauārai i tohua e te Kōti Whenua Māori, ko tērā kei roto i te ture o 1889:
    
    ###### Ngā kōreorero i waenga i ngā tāngata o Pouakani me te Karauna
    
    (5) I muri o te whakatau nei a te Kōti Whenua Māori, e tautoko ana i a Mr Paki me ngātāngata o Pouakani, i hikina e te Kōti te tono, kia taea ai e ngā taha e rua te whitiwhiti kōrero mēnākoinā te hiahia, kia taea rānei te whakatakoto i ētahi atu Whakahau ā-ture e pā ana ki te tono:
    
    (6) Nō te marama o Tihema o te tau 1997, i whakaūtia e te Rūnanga Kāwanatanga te Whakaaetanga o te Mana Kōkiri o Pouakani; mātēnei i whai mana ai ngā kaiwhakarite o Pouakani ki te whitiwhiti kōrero me te Karauna kia taea te whakatau kōrero pūmau, tūturu hoki, kia ea ai ngā tono a Pouakani i roto i ngā tau, ā, kia makere mai hoki ngā mamae e rangona nei e ngātāngata o Pouakani:
    
    (7) I hainahia Ngā Whakaritenga mō ngā Whitiwhiti Kōrero e ngā kaiwhakarite o te Karauna me te hunga o Pouakani i te 9 o Hune o te tau 1998:
    
    (8) E whakamihi ana te Karauna i te mea kua 23 tau a John Hanita Paki e mahi ana kia whakatauhia te tono mō Pouakani, me te mea anō, kua pau tana kaha me te wā i ana whitiwhiti kōrero me te Karauna:
    
    ###### Whakamutunga o ngā Kerēme 
    
    (9) I te 19 o Noema o te tau 1999, i uru atu te Karauna rātou ko ngā tāngata o Pouakani ki tētahi whakataunga whakaaetanga, e whakaae ana te Karauna, nā ngā mahi me ngā pānga mai o ngā Ture Whenua Māori, i pēhi i ngā tāngata o Pouakani i tō rātou rohe. Ko tētahi anō mea o te whakataunga whakaaetanga, e mau ana i a ia ngā kōrero tika e tareka ai he whakataunga e tutuki pū ai ngā tono a Pouakani i roto i ngā tau, me ngā tono e pā ana ki ngā ripa tauārai o Pouakani.
    
    ##### Background in English 
    
    (1) The [Treaty of Waitangi][74] is set out, in Māori and English, in [Schedule 1][71]:
    
    ###### Claim under the Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975
    
    (2) The Pouakani claim, registered with the Waitangi Tribunal as Wai 33 in 1987, sought compensation for the Pouakani grievances. The claim was lodged by John Hanita Paki on behalf of himself, the trustees, and the beneficial owners of the lands in the Titiraupenga and Pouakani B9B Trusts. The claim was heard between May and October 1989, and the Tribunal issued its report in 1993:
    
    ###### Findings of the Waitangi Tribunal
    
    (3) The Tribunal found that---
        
    *   (a) in 1889, the boundaries of the 1887 Maraeroa block had not been fixed by the Native Land Court because the requirements of the Native Land Act 1880, under which the order had been made, had not been complied with. The Tribunal concluded, therefore, that the boundary between the Maraeroa and Pouakani blocks as surveyed by Stubbing in 1892, and drawn on ML6406 and on subsequent plans, is correct:
    
    *   (b) significant areas of land, including Pouakani No 1 Block, were acquired by the Crown in payment of survey costs, in addition to the purchase of individual interests, but Māori did not always receive in return a properly surveyed title:
    
    *   (c) in reaching the conclusion that there was nothing illegal or unacceptable in contemporary practice in the transactions on the Maraeroa and Pouakani blocks in the 1880s and 1890s, the Tribunal was still left with a strong sense of Māori grievance and frustration:
    
    *   (d) Māori paid a disproportionate cost for Pakeha settlement, but little provision was made for Māori participation in the suggested benefits of the introduction of capital and settlers. The system of Native Land Court investigation of title and individualisation of interests in land, which could be sold piecemeal, contributed largely to social disruption, dissension over issues of mana and territory, massive debts, costly mistakes in survey boundaries in some cases, and failure to survey in others, and costly litigation:
    
    *   (e) a _prima facie_ case was presented that the Crown acquired excessive amounts of land in payment of survey costs and other charges in the Rohe Potae. The Tribunal also acknowledged that further investigation would be required to determine this matter definitively:
    
    *   (f) because not all the boundaries of the lands in the 1891 Title Orders creating Pouakani B9 (Pureora) and Pouakani C1 (Kaiwha) blocks had been surveyed, those orders would not have been registrable in the Land Transfer Office and registered titles could not have been issued for them. The Native Land Court created fresh boundaries in 1899 when, on the application of the Crown, the court divided the lands between the Crown and the Māori owners who had not sold. Because not all the boundaries were surveyed, with the passage of time the survey work, for which the owners had paid 343 acres of their land in 1899, became almost valueless. The Crown in general does have an obligation to ensure the completion of surveys of agreed boundaries, and to compensate Māori owners for the deficiencies of the Auckland Survey Office in the 1890s which led the Māori owners of Pouakani B9B block into costly litigation:
    
    *   (g) in past Crown administration of the forest that is now the Pureora Forest Park, there has been inadequate concern for Māori perspectives in the management of a forest which is regarded as a taonga by local tribes:
    
    ###### Findings of the Māori Land Court
    
    (4) In 1996, the Māori Land Court issued a decision that the 1891 Native Land Court order regarding the Pouakani/Maraeroa boundary was in contravention of the Native Land Court Acts Amendment Act 1889\. The boundary was therefore found by the Māori Land Court to be that contained in the 1889 legislation:
    
    ###### Negotiations between the Pouakani people and the Crown
    
    (5) After the Māori Land Court decision, which was in favour of Mr Paki and the Pouakani people, the court adjourned the application _sine die_ to permit the parties to negotiate, or to seek any further orders with regard to the application:
    
    (6) In December 1997, Cabinet accepted the Pouakani Deed of Mandate, which authorised the Pouakani negotiators to enter into negotiations with the Crown for a full and final settlement of the Pouakani historical claims and to remove the sense of grievance felt by the Pouakani people:
    
    (7) The Terms of Negotiations were signed for and on behalf of the Crown and the Pouakani negotiators on 9 June 1998:
    
    (8) The Crown acknowledges that John Hanita Paki has worked on settling the Pouakani claim for 23 years and that negotiations with the Crown have consumed his energy and time:
    
    ###### Settlement of claims
    
    (9) On 19 November 1999, the Crown and the Pouakani people entered into a deed of settlement in which the Crown acknowledged that the operation and impact of the Native Land Laws caused the Pouakani people to suffer prejudice in their rohe and which recorded the matters required to give effect to a full and final settlement of the Pouakani historical claims and the Pouakani boundary claims.

[s 35][51]

#### Statutory area

The area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the area known as the Crown-owned area of Titiraupenga, as shown on SO Plan 61525\.

#### Preamble

Under [section 35][51] of the Pouakani Claims Settlement Act 2000 (clause 3.2.1 of the deed of settlement), the Crown acknowledges the Pouakani people's statement of the Pouakani people's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to the Crown-owned area of Titiraupenga as set out below.

_TIHEI MAURI ORA_

Titiraupenga and Pureora journeyed long and far to find others of their kind. Despite horrendous adversity they struggled on until eventually upon the desolate plain of despair they resolved to meet their end together and embraced for one last time. Ranginui, sky father, was so moved by the strength of their spirit and love that he turned them to stone granting them immortality to serve as symbols of good. Their ""family"" are dotted throughout the continents and oceans of this world.

Later Tarapikau, the guardian and traveller of mountain trails, who resides in many places of Aotearoa, used to rest on the sacred peak of Titiraupenga to greet the first light of the new day as he could survey the vast interior while gathering the warmth of the sun's first rays.

The Patupaearehe or fairy people's laughter can still be heard in the swift running streams of Titiraupenga Maunga. They are the caretakers of the native flora and always ensure that the streams run free. Shy yet playful, they embody the spirit of the child and are part of the story of the Titiraupenga Mountain.

Te Ririo, younger brother of Takaka, is a forest guardian also associated with Titiraupenga. He tolerated no disrespect and to anger him was to invite misfortune or even death. He was left offerings of food by only the most highly born individuals such as Te Tuiri and Te Heu Heu.

Kupe, the great explorer/navigator, and his descendants were the first to explore the interior of the North Island following their discovery of Aotearoa and they settled in the areas that afforded the best conditions for survival. The Kahupungapunga people settled on Titiraupenga and the surrounding lands. Food was plentiful as the great forests of the region abounded with large flocks of Kereru and other bird life. The streams and forests provided the food, medicinal and other needs of these people of the land.

In more recent times Tia, an ancestor of renown to people of the Arawa canoe, named many natural features as he journeyed through the central North Island. He eventually settled on the northern slopes of Titiraupenga with the tangata whenua and is very highly regarded as the tipuna of the Pouakani people. Upon his death he was interred near the peak of the mountain.

The tipuna Te Wano is also associated with Titiraupenga. Nearing the time of his passing he asked his relatives of Tokaanu to carry him up the slopes of Titiraupenga to gaze for one last time at the lands of his people, Ngati Apakura. He died and was buried on Titiraupenga. The settlements of Kaiwha, Pukerimu, Huiarau and Marae Totara were just some of the settlements on the slopes of Titiraupenga. Trails from the four points of the compass met and connected these places with people of other areas who traded many commodities. Greenstone journeyed along one such sacred trail and was sometimes left in the shallows of a sacred Titiraupenga stream before continuing on. In times of trouble, gongs were sounded at certain places along these trails to announce impending arrivals.

Titiraupenga and Pureora stand today as they always have, ancient sentinels in the stream of time, who have worn the cloak of Tane (the native forest) with the ageless dignity of the Tuakana that they are.

#### Purposes of statutory acknowledgment

Under [section 36][52] of the Pouakani Claims Settlement Act 2000 (clause 3.2.5 of the deed of settlement), and without limiting the rest of this schedule, the only purposes of this statutory acknowledgement are---
    
*   (a) to require that consent authorities forward summaries of resource consent applications to the Pouakani governance entity as required by regulations made under [section 37][53] of the Pouakani Claims Settlement Act 2000 (clause 3.2.2 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (b) to require that consent authorities, the Historic Places Trust, and the Environment Court have regard to this statutory acknowledgement in relation to the Crown-owned area of Titiraupenga, as provided in [sections 38 to 40][54] of the Pouakani Claims Settlement Act 2000 (clause 3.2.3 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (c) to enable the Pouakani governance entity and any member of the Pouakani people to cite this statutory acknowledgement as evidence of the association of the Pouakani people to the Crown-owned area of Titiraupenga, as provided in [section 41][57] of the Pouakani Claims Settlement Act 2000 (clause 3.2.4 of the deed of settlement).

#### Limitations on effect of statutory acknowledgement

Except as expressly provided in [sections 36][52] and [38 to 41][54] of the Pouakani Claims Settlement Act 2000 (clauses 3.2.3 to 3.2.5 of the deed of settlement),---
    
*   (a) this statutory acknowledgement does not affect, and is not to be taken into account in, the exercise of a power, duty, or function by a person or entity under a statute, regulation, or bylaw; and

*   (b) without limiting paragraph (a), no person or entity, in considering a matter or making a decision or recommendation under a statute, regulation, or bylaw, may give greater or lesser weight to the Pouakani people's association with the Crown-owned area of Titiraupenga (as described in this statutory acknowledgement) than that person or entity would give under the relevant statute, regulation, or bylaw if no statutory acknowledgement existed in respect of the Crown-owned area of Titiraupenga.

Except as expressly provided in the Pouakani Claims Settlement Act 2000, this statutory acknowledgement does not affect the lawful rights or interests of a person who is not a party to the deed of settlement.

Except as expressly provided in the Pouakani Claims Settlement Act 2000, this statutory acknowledgement does not have the effect of granting, creating, or providing evidence of an estate or interest in, or any rights of any kind whatsoever relating to, the Crown-owned area of Titiraupenga.

This statutory acknowledgement does not preclude the Crown from providing a statutory acknowledgement in respect of the Crown-owned area of Titiraupenga to persons other than the Pouakani people.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Pouakani Claims Settlement Act 2000\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 23 May 2008, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that have yet to come into force or that contain relevant transitional or savings provisions are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order.

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][154] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/legislation/reprints.shtml or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][155] and [17E][156] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
