    *   (a) the court has power to exonerate any part of the estate of the deceased from the incidence of the order made under this Act, after hearing such of the parties who may be affected by the exoneration as the court thinks necessary, and may for that purpose direct any personal representative to represent, or appoint any person to represent, any such party:
    
    *   (b) the court has power at any time to fix a periodical payment or lump sum to be paid by any beneficiary in the estate of the deceased to represent, or in commutation of, any liability under the order that falls upon the portion of the estate in which he or she is interested, and to exonerate that portion from further liability and to direct in what manner the payment is to be secured.
    
    (5) For the purposes of subsections (2) to (4), in cases where the authority of the court does not extend and cannot directly or indirectly be made to extend to the whole estate, the estate of the deceased includes only so much of it as is subject to the authority of the court.
