##### 8 Right of parties to agree on other methods
    
*   Nothing in this schedule prevents the parties from agreeing to have the dispute or any issues in dispute determined in a way different from that set out in this schedule.

##### 9 Power of arbitrating body to waive technical irregularities
    
*   The arbitrating body in its discretion may waive any technical irregularity or omission that may have occurred in the submission or reference of a dispute to the arbitrating body, if it is satisfied that the provisions of this Act have been substantially complied with.
