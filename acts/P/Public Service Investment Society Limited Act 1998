An Act to enable The Public Service Investment Society Limited to be registered as a company under the Companies Act 1993
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    Whereas:
    
    A The Public Service Investment Society Limited is a society incorporated under the [Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1908][18] with approximately 130,000 members:
    
    B The society wishes to be registered as a company under the [Companies Act 1993][19] with the initial shares in the company held by the members of the society:
    
    C [Section 14A][20] of the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1908 enables industrial and provident societies to be registered as companies, but requires an application for registration as a company to be signed by all the initial shareholders:
    
    D It is impracticable for the society to obtain the signatures of all its members to an application for registration as a company:
    
    E Registration of the society as a company in accordance with [section 14A][20] of the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1908 may result in the company becoming liable for the payment of taxes and duties:
    
    F It is not considered appropriate that liability for taxes and duties should be incurred as a result solely of a change in the legal status of the society:
    
    G The society wishes that provision is made for other matters in connection with its registration as a company:
    
    H Legislation is the only means by which the society can be registered as a company conveniently and without the risk of adverse tax and other consequences:
    
    I The objects of this Act can be attained only by legislation.

    (2) For the purposes of an enactment, rule of law, contract, or agreement relating to the employee, the contract of employment of the employee must be treated as unbroken and a period of service with the society must be treated as a period of service with the company.

        *   (ii) as having been entered into, or performed by, the company at the time it was entered into, or performed by, the society.
        
        
    
    (2) A person must be treated as having held a voting interest or a market value interest in the company at all times from the time the person became a member of the society if---
        
    *   (a) the person acquired the voting interest or the market value interest in the company after its registration; and
    
    *   (b) immediately prior to the cancellation of the registration of the society the person was a member of the society and the interest in the company was acquired solely by virtue of that membership.
    
    (3) The terms _voting interest_ and _market value interest_ have the same meanings as they have in the Income Tax Act 2007\.
    
    Section 13(3): amended, on 1 April 2008 (effective for 2008--09 income year and later income years, except when the context requires otherwise), by [section ZA 2(1)][24] of the Income Tax Act 2007 (2007 No 97).

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Public Service Investment Society Limited Act 1998\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 April 2008, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that have yet to come into force or that contain relevant transitional or savings provisions are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order.

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][26] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][27] and [17E][28] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
