    *   (f) recognise any overseas qualification, certificate, registration, or licence as satisfying a particular minimum standard for registration (in whole or in part) if, in the opinion of the Board, that overseas qualification, certificate, registration, or licence is equivalent to, or as satisfactory as, the standard, or part of the standard, that is treated as being satisfied.
    
    (2) The terms and conditions referred to in subsection (1)(c) may include, for example,---

##### 8 Meaning of interested
    
*   (1) For the purposes of [clauses 9 to 11][304], a member of the Board is interested in a transaction of, or other matter relating to, the Board only if the member---
        
    *   (a) is a party to, or will or may derive a material financial benefit from, the transaction or matter; or
    
    *   (b) has a material financial interest in another party to the transaction or a person to whom the matter relates; or

    *   (b) if neither the chairperson nor the deputy chairperson is able to act or the positions of the chairperson and deputy chairperson are vacant, the Minister.
    
    (2) The details are---
        
    *   (a) the nature of the interest and the monetary value of the interest (if the monetary value can be quantified); or
    
    *   (b) the nature and extent of the interest (if the monetary value cannot be quantified).
    
    

##### 11 Consequences of interest

##### 12 Resolution assented to by members
    
*   (1) The chairperson may circulate, by letter or electronic transmission, to each member of the Board a document setting out a draft resolution and requesting each member to assent to the resolution within a specified period of at least 3 clear days.
    
    (2) If a majority of the members of the Board, by letter or electronic transmission, signs or assents to a resolution circulated under subclause (1), the resolution is as valid and effective as if it had been passed at a meeting of the Board duly called and constituted.
    
    (3) Any such resolution may consist of several documents that are similar in form, each signed or appearing to have been sent by 1 or more members.
    
    (4) Every such resolution must be tabled at the next meeting of the Board held after the date on which the resolution takes effect.

##### 13 Teleconference meetings
    
*   (1) The contemporaneous linking together by telephone or videolink or other means of communication of a number of members, being not less than the quorum stated in [clause 3][306], whether or not 1 or more of those members are out of New Zealand, is to be taken as constituting a meeting of the Board to which the provisions of this Act apply, if the following conditions are met:
        
    *   (a) notice must have been given, by letter or telephone or electronic transmission, to every member of the Board entitled to receive notice of a meeting of the Board; and
    
    *   (b) each member taking part in the meeting must---
            
        *   (i) be linked by telephone or videolink or other means of communication for the purposes of the meeting; and
        
        *   (ii) at the commencement of the meeting acknowledge, to all the other members taking part, the member's presence for the purpose of a meeting of the Board; and
        
        *   (iii) be able throughout the meeting to hear each of the other members taking part; and
        
        *   (iv) on any vote, individually express his or her vote to the meeting.
        
        
    
    (2) A member may not stop participating in a meeting held under this clause by disconnecting the member's telephone or videolink or other means of communication without the express consent of the person presiding at the meeting.
    
    (3) A minute of the proceedings at a meeting held under this clause is sufficient evidence of those proceedings, and the observance of all necessary formalities, if certified as a correct minute by the person presiding at the meeting.

##### 14 Procedure
    
*   (1) The Board must observe the rules of natural justice but, subject to that requirement, may receive as evidence any statement, document, information, or matter, whether or not it would be admissible in a court of law.
    
    (2) Subject to this Act and any regulations, the Board may regulate its procedure in any manner as it thinks fit.

##### 15 Appointment of committees
    
*   The Board may appoint 1 or more committees of the Board, and---
        
    *   (a) any committee may include or consist of persons who are not members of the Board; and
    
    *   (b) the Board must regulate the procedure of each committee in any manner as it thinks fit; and
    
    *   (c) the Board may at any time discharge, alter, or reconstitute any committee.
    
    

##### 16 Delegation
    
*   (1) The Board may, by written notice, delegate any of its functions, duties, or powers (other than powers of decision concerning discipline under [Part 3][109]) to any committee appointed under [clause 15][307].
    
    (2) Unless otherwise provided in the delegation, a delegate may exercise a function, duty, or power of the Board delegated to it under this clause in the same manner and with the same effect as if the delegate were the Board, but may not further delegate the function, duty, or power.
    
    (3) Any delegation under this clause may be revoked at any time, and the delegation of a function, duty, or power does not prevent the Board from exercising the function, duty, or power itself.
    
    (4) Every delegate purporting to act under any delegation under this clause is, until the contrary is proved, presumed to be acting in accordance with the terms of the delegation.

##### 17 Seal
    
*   (1) The Board must provide for the safe custody of the common seal of the Board, which must be in any form that the Board decides.
    
    (2) The common seal may be used only by the authority of a resolution of the Board, or of a committee of the Board, and every document to which the seal is affixed must be signed by 2 persons, each of whom is---

    *   (b) a person authorised to sign that document or documents of that kind.
    
    (3) The seal of the Board must be judicially noticed in all courts and for all purposes.

##### 18 Insurance of members of Board and other persons
    
*   The Board may enter into contracts of insurance insuring members of the Board, members of any committee of the Board, any persons appointed to advise the Board, and any investigators, against loss from personal accident arising out of and in the course of the exercise and performance of their functions and powers under this Act, and may pay the premiums payable in respect of any of those contracts.
