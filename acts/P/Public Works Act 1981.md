    (6) Subject to subsection (5), the acceptance of any offer may at the option of the owner be in full and final settlement of compensation or without prejudice to the owner's right to have compensation determined under this Part.

On such amendment the land granted shall become subject to and, where applicable, receive the benefit of, all encumbrances, easements, and other interests noted on the certificate of title.
    
    (9B) Where any land is so amalgamated, the District Land Registrar may, if he thinks fit, dispense with any survey that would otherwise be required for the purposes of the issue of a certificate of title under this section, and may issue a certificate of title limited as to parcels.
    
    (9C) Before including a recital in a certificate under subsection (9A), the Minister, Minister of Railways, or local authority, as the case may be, shall consult with the District Land Registrar as to whether or not it is practicable to amalgamate the land in an existing certificate of title and, if the District Land Registrar advises that it is not practicable to do so, no such recital shall be included in the certificate.

    (15) Every instrument creating or evidencing or affecting any such encumbrance, lien, or interest, and all covenants and other provisions expressed or implied therein, shall be construed as if the land for which the certificate of title is issued were the land, or (as the case may be) part of the land, to which the instrument relates.
    
    (16) On the issue of any such certificate of title so subject to any registered encumbrance, lien, or interest, the District Land Registrar shall enter in the appropriate register, and record on any relevant instrument, memorials showing that the land is affected by subsections (14) and (15) and the certificate.
    
    (17) Where any land subject to any reservation or restriction is taken or acquired under this Act and land is to be granted under this section, the land so granted shall, unless the Minister or the Minister of Railways or the local authority otherwise directs, be issued subject to that reservation or restriction.
    
    (18) Every certificate issued under this section shall be conclusive evidence to the District Land Registrar of the matters required or permitted by this section to be therein stated, and that all consents required under this section have been obtained.

    (3) The recital in any notice under this Part of the certificate of title for any parcel of land with which any land referred to in the notice is to be amalgamated in one certificate of title shall have the effect of vesting that land in the registered proprietor or proprietors for the time being of the land comprised in that certificate of title for an estate in fee simple in possession, and shall be sufficient authority to the District Land Registrar to issue such certificate of title, without fee.
    
    (4) Notwithstanding anything in the [Joint Family Homes Act 1964][404], the recital in any notice under this Part that any registered proprietor to whom subsection (3) applies is the settlor of any adjoining land as a joint family home under that Act, shall be deemed to be a sufficient application to the District Land Registrar to settle the additional land acquired under the notice as part of the joint family home under [section 4][408] of that Act, and the provisions of that Act shall apply accordingly.
    
    (5) The recital in any notice under this Part, or a certificate under the hand of the Commissioner of Crown Lands appointed under section 12A of the Survey Act 1986, that any land is to be incorporated in any lease or licence pursuant to this Part shall be sufficient authority to the District Land Registrar to make an appropriate entry without fee in respect of the incorporation on the lease or licence or other instrument of title which is registered in his office, and also upon the outstanding duplicate of it.
    
    (6) The publication in the _Gazette_ of any notice purporting to be issued under this Part shall be conclusive evidence that all conditions precedent to the issue of the notice have been complied with, and no person shall be concerned to inquire whether any consent has been given or other condition attaching to the issue of the notice has been fulfilled.

    (8) Where, in any case to which [section 117(6)][149] does not apply, any land that is subject to any registered encumbrance, lien, or interest is declared road with the consent under paragraph (b), or paragraph (c), or paragraph (i) of [section 114(2)][146] of the owner or body or persons in whom the land or its control is vested and with the consent of the person entitled to the registered encumbrance, lien, or interest, and other land is vested or otherwise disposed of in exchange for it, then, unless the notice otherwise directs, the other land shall be granted or disposed of subject to that registered encumbrance, lien, or interest.
    
    (9) On the issue of a certificate of title for any land vested or otherwise disposed of in exchange so subject to any registered encumbrance, lien, or interest, every instrument creating or evidencing or affecting that encumbrance, lien, or interest, and all covenants and other provisions expressed or implied in it, shall be construed as if the land so granted or disposed of were the land or, as the case may be, part of the land to which the instrument relates.
    
    (10) On the issue of a certificate of title for any land vested or otherwise disposed of in exchange so subject to any registered encumbrance, lien, or interest, the District Land Registrar shall enter in the appropriate register and record on any relevant instrument a memorial setting out the effect in the circumstances of subsection (9).

    (12) The provisions of subsections (8) to (11) shall apply in respect of consents under [section 119(3)][151] to the taking of any land under that section as if they were consents under paragraph (b) or paragraph (c) or paragraph (i) of [section 114(2)][146] to the declaration of the land as road.

        *   (iii) the availability of surplus water for supply in accordance with [section 217(3)][276]---
        
        to do so will not adversely affect the revenue of the irrigation district.
