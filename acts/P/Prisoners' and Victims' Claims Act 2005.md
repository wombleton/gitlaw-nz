    *   (b) requires other remedies to be used if, in the particular circumstances, they are capable, alone or in combination, of providing effective redress; and
    
    *   (c) encourages timely mitigation of loss or damage by the plaintiff and the defendant if that is reasonably practicable; and
    
    *   (d) ensures the court or Tribunal takes into account specified matters (including the extent (if any) to which effective redress has been, or could be, provided otherwise than by compensation) before awarding compensation.
    
    

##### 12 Application
    
*   (1) This subpart applies only to proceedings in or before a court or tribunal in which 1 or more specified claims are made and that---

    *   (a) the plaintiff has made reasonable use of all of the specified internal and external complaints mechanisms reasonably available to him or her to complain about the act or omission on which the claim is based, but has not obtained in relation to that act or omission redress that the court or Tribunal considers effective; and
    
    *   (b) another remedy, or a combination of other remedies, cannot provide, in relation to the act or omission on which the claim is based, redress that the court or Tribunal considers effective.

    *   (a) the extent (if any) to which the plaintiff, the defendant, or both took, within a reasonable time, all reasonably practicable steps to mitigate loss or damage arising from the act or omission on which the claim is based; and
    
    *   (b) whether the defendant's breach of, or interference with, the right concerned was deliberate or in bad faith; and
    
    *   (c) the relevant conduct of the plaintiff; and
    
    *   (d) the consequences for the plaintiff of the breach of, or interference with, the right concerned; and
    
    *   (e) the freedoms, interests, liberties, principles, or values recognised and protected by the right concerned; and
    
    *   (f) any need to emphasise the importance of, or deter other breaches of or other interferences with, the right concerned; and
    
    *   (g) the extent (if any) to which effective redress in relation to that act or omission has been, or could be, provided otherwise than by compensation; and
    
    *   (h) any other matters the court or Tribunal considers relevant.
    
    (3) In this section, the _right concerned_ has the meaning given to it by the definition of specified claim in [section 6][7].

*   (1) The availability of documents filed with the Secretary of the Tribunal, filed in the Tribunal, or accessed under [section 35][41] by the Tribunal, in connection with a victim's claim under this subpart must be determined in accordance with the rules regulating the practice and procedure of District Courts.
    
    (2) For the purposes of this section, a direction given by the Tribunal forbidding inspection of a document without the Tribunal's leave must be treated as if it were given by, and required the leave of, a District Court Judge.
    
    (3) Nothing in this section applies to a document or record to which [section 31(3)][37] or [section 36][42] applies.

##### 45 Other aspects of procedure
    
*   Subject to [sections 28 to 44][34], [46][52], [59][67], and [60][68], the Tribunal may regulate the procedure for determining victims' claims in any manner it thinks fit.

##### 46 Tribunal to determine group of claims received
    
*   (1) The Tribunal must determine together as a group victims' claims (including related questions as to interest and costs) filed under [section 28][34] in response to---
        
    *   (a) a notice required by [section 20][25] (the _notice_); or
    
    *   (b) a notice that, under [section 22][27], is given as an addition to the notice.
    
    (2) The Tribunal must not accept a victim's claim unless satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that---
        
    *   (a) the claimant is a victim of the offender; and
    
    *   (b) the victim has, through or by means of the offence, suffered injury, loss, or damage for which the victim has not received, and is not to receive, effective redress; and
    
    *   (c) the claim discloses a cause of action that is, under the general law, one for which damages are, in the particular case, payable.
    
    (3) If the Tribunal accepts a victim's claim it may, after having had regard to all other related claims accepted by it, order that an amount of money must be paid to the victim concerned.
    
    (4) The Tribunal may also order that an amount of money must be paid to the victims concerned if the payment proposed is---
        
    *   (a) agreed to by all victims and the offender concerned; and
    
    *   (b) one that the Tribunal considers is reasonable by way of final settlement of the victims' claims concerned.
    
    (5) The Tribunal's determination of a group of claims filed under [section 28][34] must be recorded in a single written order that specifies the entitlements (if any) of all victims concerned.

##### 47 Further provisions on determination of claims received
    
*   (1) The Tribunal must determine any amounts to be paid to victims without taking account in any way of the amount of money actually held in the account for the offender.
    
    (2) In determining whether to order under [section 46(3) or (4)][52] that an amount be paid to a victim by way of damages or exemplary damages, and in quantifying that amount, the Tribunal must apply the general law relating to the awarding of damages.
    
    (3) The Tribunal may, if it thinks fit, include in the amount ordered to be paid to a victim under [section 46(3) or (4)][52] interest at a rate, not exceeding the prescribed rate, it thinks fit on some or all of the damages for all or a part of the period between the date when the cause of action arose and the date of the order.
    
    (4) However, the Tribunal cannot give interest upon interest.
    
    (5) In this section and in [section 50][56], _the prescribed rate_ means the prescribed rate as defined in [section 62B(4)][152] of the District Courts Act 1947\.
    
    (6) Without limiting the Tribunal's powers, the Tribunal may dismiss a victim's claim if satisfied that it is frivolous, vexatious, or made solely for the purpose of delay.

##### 48 Implementation of order
    
*   (1) The Secretary must implement promptly an order under [section 46][52]---
        
    *   (a) if, at the expiry of the 20-working-day period in [section 51(3)(b)][57] (the _period_), no appeals against the order (_appeals_), or applications for further time for filing appeals (_applications_), have been filed; or
    
    *   (b) if every application filed within the period has been withdrawn, or has been finally determined and declined; or
    
    *   (c) if, at the expiry of all further time allowed under [section 51(3)(b)][57] in response to applications filed within the period, no appeals have been filed; or
    
    *   (d) once all appeals filed within the period, or filed within further time allowed under [section 51(3)(b)][57] in response to an application within the period, have been withdrawn or finally determined.
    
    (2) However, if an application has been filed after the expiry of the period, the Secretary may defer implementing the order until any resulting appeal is withdrawn or finally determined.
    
    (3) If the amounts to be paid under the order are, in total, equal to or less than the amount of money held in the account for the offender, the Secretary must implement the order fully by paying from the money held in the account for the offender the amounts to be paid under the order to the victims concerned.
    
    (4) If the amounts to be paid under the order are, in total, more than the amount of money held in the account for the offender, the Secretary must implement the order in part by paying the money held in the account for the offender to the victims concerned on a proportional basis by reference to the amounts to be paid under the order to each of those victims.
    
    (5) Implementation of an order in part, under subsection (4), does not prevent any or all of the victims concerned from enforcing their entitlements under the order against the offender, and the partially implemented order may be enforced---
        
    *   (a) by way of a deduction, under [section 18(1)(c)][23], from any money received later under [section 17][22]; or
    
    *   (b) under subsection (6), as if it were a judgment of the District Court.
    
    (6) A copy of a partially implemented order under [section 46][52] or an order under [section 50(3)(b)][56] may be filed without fee in an office of a District Court for the purposes of enforcement and, on being so filed, the copy of the order has the same effect as a judgment of the District Court, and may be enforced accordingly.

##### 49 Procedure if victim or others entitled cannot be found
    
*   (1) The Secretary must pay the money to the offender promptly if the Secretary is, 1 year after first being required by [section 48(3) or (4)][54] to pay to a victim money held in the account for the offender, unable, despite having taken reasonable steps for the purpose, to locate the victim or to identify and locate another person legally entitled to the money.
    
    (2) Subsection (1) applies subject to the prior implementation of any provision of an out-of-court final settlement of a specified claim requiring compensation to be withheld from an offender and used to satisfy the offender's outstanding fines.
    
    (3) This section overrides [section 48][54].

##### 50 Order under section 46 must be varied in certain circumstances
    
*   (1) This section applies if, after an order is made under [section 46][52], the conviction of the offender to which the order relates is set aside---
        
    *   (a) without an order for retrial; or
    
    *   (b) with a retrial being ordered but the retrial---
            
        *   (i) is not proceeded with; or
        
        *   (ii) does not result in a conviction; or
        
        *   (iii) is ended by a stay of proceedings.
        
        
    
    (2) If this section applies, the person whose conviction was set aside may file with the Tribunal any court record or other official document that records any or all of the matters referred to in subsection (1).
    
    (3) If the Tribunal is satisfied, on receiving any record or other official document under subsection (2), that this section applies, the Tribunal must---
        
    *   (a) vary the relevant order made under [section 46][52] to exclude its application in respect of the conviction that has been set aside; and
    
    *   (b) if any money has been paid to a victim under that order, order that that money be repaid to the person whose conviction was set aside, together with interest on that sum at the prescribed rate.
    
    

##### 51 Appeal to High Court
    
*   (1) A party to a claim determined under [section 46][52] may appeal to the High Court against the order concerned only on a question of law.
    
    (2) However, no party may appeal against an order made by the Tribunal with the agreement of all parties under [section 46(4)][52].
    
    (3) An appeal must be---
        
    *   (a) brought by way of notice of appeal in accordance with rules of court; and
    
    *   (b) filed within 20 working days after notice of the decision or order is communicated to the appellant, or within any further time a High Court Judge allows on application made before or after the period expires.
    
    (4) On any appeal under this section, the High Court may---
        
    *   (a) make any determination or determinations it thinks should have been made:
    
    *   (b) direct the Tribunal to---
            
        *   (i) consider or determine (whether for the first time or again) any matters the High Court directs; or
        
        *   (ii) rehear the proceeding:
        
        
    
    *   (c) make any order or further order it thinks fit.
    
    (5) The relevant order under [section 46][52] is suspended until an appeal under this section is withdrawn or finally determined.

*   (1) The Secretary must pay to the offender promptly any amount of money that continues to be held in the account for the offender after an order under [section 46][52] has been implemented fully under [section 48(3)][54].
    
    (2) Subsection (1) applies subject to the prior implementation of any provision of an out-of-court final settlement of a specified claim requiring compensation to be withheld from an offender and used to satisfy the offender's outstanding fines.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Prisoners' and Victims' Claims Act 2005\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 30 June 2012, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][173] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][174] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][175] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][176] and [17E][177] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
