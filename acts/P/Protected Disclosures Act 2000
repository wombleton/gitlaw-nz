#### Protected disclosures

##### 6 Disclosures to which Act applies
    
*   
    
    
    
    (1) An employee
    of an organisation may disclose information in accordance
    with this Act if---
    
    *   (a) the information is about serious wrongdoing
        in or by that organisation; and
        
    
    
    
    *   (b) the employee believes on reasonable grounds
        that the information is true or likely to be true; and
        
        
    
    
    
    *   (c) the employee wishes to disclose the information
        so that the serious wrongdoing can be investigated; and
        
        
    
    
    
    *   (d) the employee wishes the disclosure to
        be protected.
        
    
    
    
    
    (2) Any disclosure
    made in accordance with subsection (1) is a protected disclosure of information for the purposes of this
    Act.
    
    
    (3) If an employee of an organisation believes on reasonable
    grounds that the information he or she discloses is about serious
    wrongdoing in or by that organisation but the belief is mistaken,
    the information must be treated as complying with subsection (1)(a)
    for the purposes of the protections conferred by this Act and by [section 66(1)(a)][55] of the Human Rights Act 1993\.
    
    
    
    (4) This section is subject to [section 6A][8].
    
    
    
    
    
    Section 6(1): amended, on 6 May 2009, by [section 5(1)][56] of the Protected
    Disclosures Amendment Act 2009 (2009 No 11).
    
    Section 6(3): added, on 6 May 2009, by [section 5(2)][56] of the Protected
    Disclosures Amendment Act 2009 (2009 No 11).
    
    Section 6(4): added, on 6 May 2009, by [section 5(2)][56] of the Protected
    Disclosures Amendment Act 2009 (2009 No 11).
    
    



##### 6A Technical
failure to comply with or refer to Act
    
*   
    
    
    
    (1) A disclosure of information is not prevented from being
    a protected disclosure of information for the purposes of this Act
    merely because---
    
    
    *   (a) of a technical failure to comply with [sections 7 to 10][11] if the employee
        has substantially complied with the requirement in [section 6][7] to disclose the
        information in accordance with this Act; or
        
    
    
    
    *   (b) the employee does not expressly refer to the name of this
        Act when the disclosure is made.
        
    
    
    
    
    ###### Example
    
    
    Person A is an employee of Organisation B.
    
    B's internal procedures for receiving and dealing
    with information about serious wrongdoing require the information
    to be provided to B's Human Resources Manager using a particular
    form.
    
    Person A provides the information using the form to B's
    chief executive rather than the Human Resources Manager. Person A
    otherwise substantially complies with the Act.
    
    The failure to comply is merely technical. Under this
    section, the disclosure is still a protected disclosure for the purposes
    of this Act.
    
    
    
    (2) This section applies despite anything to the contrary
    expressed or implied in the relevant internal procedures.

    *   (d) the protections and remedies available under this Act
        and the [Human Rights Act 1993][58] if the disclosure

        of the person making the disclosure:

    been referred must promptly notify the person by whom the protected
    disclosure of information was made that the information disclosed
    has been so referred.
    
    
    (3) A protected
    disclosure of information does not, by reason of the information being
    referred under subsection (1), cease to be a protected disclosure
    of information.
    
    
    (4) Nothing in
    this section prevents a protected disclosure of information being
    transferred from one appropriate authority to another on more than
    1 occasion.

    (1) The protections conferred by [sections 17 to 19][29] apply, with all

    as if the information were a protected disclosure of information.
    
    
    
    (2) In this section, a person volunteers supporting information
    if the person---
    
    
    *   (a) provides information, in support of a protected disclosure
        of information made by another person, to---
        
        
        *   (i) a person investigating the disclosure; or
            
            
        
        
        
        *   (ii) the person who made the disclosure; and

        serious wrongdoing can be investigated.
        
    
    
    
    
    (3) However, a person does not volunteer supporting information
    if the person provides the supporting information only after being---
    
    
    *   (a) required to do so under any enactment, rule of law, or
        contract for the purposes of the investigation; or
        
        
    
    
    
    *   (b) approached during the course of the investigation by,
        or on behalf of, the person investigating the matter.
        
        
    
    
    
    
    
    
    Section 19A: inserted, on 6 May 2009, by [section 11][75] of the Protected
    Disclosures Amendment Act 2009 (2009 No 11).
    
    



#### Miscellaneous provisions

##### 20 False allegations
    
*   
    
    
    
    The protections
    conferred by this Act and by [section 66(1)(a)][55] of the Human Rights Act 1993 do not apply where the person who makes a disclosure of information

    acts in bad faith.
    
    
    



##### 21 Other protections preserved
    
*

    statutory or otherwise, relating to the disclosure of information.
    
    
    



##### 22 Legal professional privilege
    
*   
    
    
    
    (1) Nothing in
    this Act authorises a person to disclose information protected by
    legal professional privilege.
    
    
    (2) A disclosure
    of such information is not a protected disclosure for the purposes
    of this Act.

out of Act
    
*

##### Notes


###### 1 General
    
*   
    
    
    This is a reprint of the Protected Disclosures Act 2000\.
    The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 6 May
    2009, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that have
    yet to come into force or that contain relevant transitional or savings
    provisions are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological
    order.
    



###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   
    
    
    Under [section 16D][78] of the Acts and Regulations Publication
    Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date
    of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by
    the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though
    editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations
    Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official
    volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal
    enactment and its amendments are contained.
    



###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   
    
    
    A number of editorial conventions are followed in the
    preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included
    in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted.
    For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/
    or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts
    and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in
    Force_.
    



###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations
Publication Act 1989
    
*   
    
    
    [Section
    17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act
    1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set
    out in [sections
    17D][79] and [17E][80] of that Act so that, to the
    extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment
    is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes
    that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January
    2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since
    1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation
    reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation
    and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under
    the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication
    Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant,
    in the preparation of this reprint:
    
        
    *   
        
        •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   
        
        •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
        
    *   
        
        •layout of provisions, including:
        
            
        *   
            
            •indentation
        *   
            
            •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear
            above the section)
            
        
        
        
    *   
        
        •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type,
        without quotation marks)
    *   
        
        •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   
        
        •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page
        of each Act)
    *   
        
        •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
        
    *   
        
        •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals,
        and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   
        
        •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
        
            
        *   
            
            •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared
            with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are
            amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word
            (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
            
        *   
            
            •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now
            capital letters
            
        
        
        
    *   
        
        •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule),
        and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   
        
        •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
        
    *   
        
        •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules
        of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather
        than chronological).
