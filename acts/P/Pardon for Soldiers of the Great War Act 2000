*   #### Preamble
    
    
    
    
    (1) In the Great War, 5 soldiers of the New
    Zealand Expeditionary Force were executed, after trial by court martial,
    for certain offences:
    
    
    
    (2) They were all volunteers:
    
    
    
    (3) One was executed for the offence of mutiny:
    
    
    
    (4) The other 4 were executed for the offence
    of desertion:
    
    
    
    (5) Their execution was not a fate that they
    deserved but was one that resulted from---
    
    
    *   (a) the harsh discipline that was believed
        at the time to be required; and
        
    
    
    
    *   (b) the application of the death penalty
        for military offences being seen at that time as an essential part
        of maintaining military discipline:
        
    
    
    
    
    (6) The execution of those 5 soldiers brought
    dishonour to both the soldiers themselves and New Zealand:
    
    
    
    (7) It is now desired to remove, so far as
    practicable, the dishonour that the execution of those 5 soldiers
    brought to those soldiers and their families.

##### 10 Effect of pardons
    
*   
    
    
    
    The pardons
    effected by [sections 5 to 9][6] recognise that the
    execution of the 5 soldiers to whom those pardons are granted was

        at the time to be required; and
        
    
    
    
    *   (b) the application of the death penalty
        for military offences being seen at that time as an essential part

##### 11 Restoration of memory

    The Government
    of New Zealand must, in relation to each soldier granted a pardon
    by this Act,---
    
    *   (a) note in its official records and, in
        particular, on the personal file of the soldier, the pardon granted
        to him and its effect; and
        
    
    
    
    *   (b) notify the Commonwealth War Graves Commission
        of the pardon granted to the soldier by this Act; and
        
        
    
    
    
    *   (c) take such other steps as, in its opinion,
        are reasonable or desirable to restore the memory of the soldiers
        granted pardons by this Act.
        
    
    
    
    
    



##### 12 Act not to create right to compensation
    
*   
    
    
    
    Nothing in this
    Act---
    
    *   (a) confers any right to compensation; or
        
        
    
    
    
    *   (b) is to be relied on in any proceedings
        as a basis for any claim to compensation,---
        
        
        *   (i) for harm caused by; or
            
            
        
        
        
        *   (ii) losses claimed to have flowed from the
            consequences of---
            
        
        
        
        any of the convictions specified in [sections 5 to 9][6].
        
    
    
    
    
    



##### 13 Scope of Act
    
*   
    
    
    
    This Act---
    
    *   (a) has effect only in relation to the offences
        and convictions specified in [sections 5 to 9][6]; and
        
        
    
    
    
    *   (b) is not to be regarded as having effect
        in relation to any other offence or any other conviction.

##### Notes


###### 1 General
    
*   
    
    
    This is a reprint of the Pardon for Soldiers of the Great
    War Act 2000\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act
    as at 15 September 2000, as specified in the list of amendments
    at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that have
    yet to come into force or that contain relevant transitional or savings
    provisions are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological
    order.
    



###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   
    
    
    Under [section 16D][15] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act
    1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the
    date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and
    by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even
    though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations
    Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official
    volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal
    enactment and its amendments are contained.
    



###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   
    
    
    A number of editorial conventions are followed in the
    preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included
    in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted.
    For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/
    or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts
    and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in
    Force_.
    



###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations
Publication Act 1989
    
*   
    
    
    [Section
    17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out
    in [sections 17D][16] and [17E][17] of that Act
    so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted
    enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice.
    Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January
    2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since
    1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of
    the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation
    reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation
    and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under
    the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act
    1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where
    relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
    
        
    *   
        
        •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   
        
        •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
        
    *   
        
        •layout of provisions, including:
        
            
        *   
            
            •indentation
        *   
            
            •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear
            above the section)
            
        
        
        
    *   
        
        •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type,
        without quotation marks)
    *   
        
        •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   
        
        •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page
        of each Act)
    *   
        
        •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
        
    *   
        
        •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals,
        and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   
        
        •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
        
            
        *   
            
            •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared
            with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are
            amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word
            (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
            
        *   
            
            •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now
            capital letters
            
        
        
        
    *   
        
        •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule),
        and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   
        
        •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
        
    *   
        
        •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules
        of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather
        than chronological).
