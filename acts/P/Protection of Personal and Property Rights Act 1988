## Part 5  
Powers and property of persons subject to property orders

##### 53 Powers of persons subject to property orders
    
*   (1) Subject to [section 36(2)][43], a person subject to a property order shall be incapable of exercising personally any of the powers vested in the manager in respect of any property to which the manager's powers extend.
    
    (2) Every transfer, lease, mortgage, or other disposition of property, and every contract (except for necessaries), made or entered into by a person subject to a property order who, by virtue of subsection (1) does not have the capacity to make or enter into it shall, unless it is made or entered into with the leave of a court, be avoidable by that person or by the manager acting for that person.
    
    (3) A court may give leave to any person subject to a property order to make any such transfer, lease, mortgage, or other disposition, or to enter into any such contract, if the court is satisfied that the transaction is for the person's benefit and that the person consents to it with adequate understanding of its nature.
    
    (4) A manager shall not be entitled to avoid any transaction under subsection (2) in any case where an application in writing has been made to the manager by any party to the transaction requiring the manager to decide whether or not to avoid the transaction, and the manager has, for a period of 28 days after the receipt of the application or such extended period as may be allowed by a court, failed to give to that party notice whether the manager is avoiding the transaction or not.
    
    (5) If the manager, after any such application, does not, within the period or extended period referred to in subsection (4), avoid the transaction, the manager shall be deemed to have continued it.
    
    (6) Subject to subsection (8), if any transaction is avoided under subsection (2), a court, on the application of any party to the transaction or of the manager, may make such orders as it thinks just for the purpose of adjusting the rights of the parties and of any other person who has received any property or money comprised in the transaction (not being a person who has received the property or money from a party in good faith and for valuable consideration or who claims through such a person).
    
    (7) Without limiting the generality of subsection (6), on an application under that subsection, a court may make an order for the restitution or transfer or payment by or to the person subject to a property order or the manager or any other person of any property or money, in whole or in part, or of any sum representing the value, in whole or in part, of any such property.
    
    (8) Relief under subsections (6) and (7) may be denied wholly or in part if the person from whom relief is sought received the property or money in good faith and has so altered his or her position in reliance on having received an indefeasible interest in it that, in the court's opinion, it would be inequitable to grant relief, or to grant relief in full, as the case may be.
    
    (9) For the purposes of subsection (2), the question whether goods or services are necessaries is a question of fact.

##### 54 Testamentary powers of person subject to property order
    
*   (1) Without limiting the generality of [section 4][5], a person subject to a property order shall not, by reason only of being subject to that order, be incapable of making testamentary dispositions.
    
    (2) A court may direct that a person subject to a property order may make a testamentary disposition only by leave of the court; and, in such a case, a testamentary disposition made without the leave of the court shall be ineffective for all purposes.
    
    (3) The court may grant leave to make a testamentary disposition under subsection (2) in respect of a testamentary disposition already made or to be made.
    
    (4) The court may cause inquiries to be made as to the existence of any testamentary disposition made by a person subject to a property order before the making of the property order (whether such testamentary disposition was made before or after the passing of this Act), and may direct that any such testamentary disposition shall be deposited in the court.
    
    (5) If it appears to the court that a testamentary disposition was made when the person was unable to manage his or her own affairs in relation to his or her property, the court may cause inquiries to be made, in such manner as the court thinks fit, whether that testamentary disposition expresses the present desire and intention of the person.
    
    (6) If the court is satisfied that the testamentary disposition does not express the present desire and intention of the person, a court may, in any case where such a course is possible, cause the present desire and intention of the person to be ascertained to the court's satisfaction, and may authorise the execution by the manager under [section 55][63] of a new testamentary disposition of that person's estate in accordance with that present desire and intention.

##### 55 Court may authorise manager to make testamentary disposition for person subject to property order
    
*   (1) Where the court has given a direction under [section 54(2)][62] that a person subject to a property order may make a testamentary disposition only by leave of the court, or the court is satisfied that such a person lacks testamentary capacity, the court may authorise the manager acting for that person to execute a will for and on behalf of that person in such terms as the court directs.
    
    (2) Before a court authorises a manager to execute a testamentary disposition under subsection (1), it shall settle the proposed terms of the testamentary disposition provisionally, and hear such persons who wish to be heard and whom the court is satisfied have a proper interest in the matter.
    
    (3) A testamentary disposition executed by a manager under this section may, while the person continues to lack testamentary capacity, be varied, or revoked and substituted, by another testamentary disposition authorised by the court and executed by the manager in the same manner as the original testamentary disposition.
    
    (4) Any testamentary disposition executed by a manager under this section shall be---
        
    *   (a) signed in the manager's name for and on behalf of the person for whom it is made, in the presence of 2 or more witnesses present at the same time; and
    
    *   (b) attested and subscribed by those witnesses in the presence of the manager; and
    
    *   (c) sealed with the seal of the court.
    
    (5) The following provisions apply to a testamentary disposition authorised and executed under this section:
        
    *   (a) it is valid despite---

        *   (ii) [sections 9][193] and [10][194] of the Wills Act 1837 of the United Kingdom Parliament; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) it has the same effect for all purposes as it would have had if the person subject to the property order---
            
        *   (i) had had testamentary capacity; and
        
        *   (ii) had executed the testamentary disposition in the manner required by the applicable section.
        
        
    
    (6) The [Law Reform (Testamentary Promises) Act 1949][195], the [Family Protection Act 1955][196], and all other enactments and rules of law relating to the estates of deceased persons shall apply in respect of any testamentary disposition executed under this section as if the person to whom it relates had had testamentary capacity and had executed the testamentary disposition in accordance with law.
    
    (7) Notwithstanding paragraph (c) of subsection (4), a testamentary disposition that is signed in accordance with paragraph (a) of that subsection, and attested and subscribed in accordance with paragraph (b) of that subsection, shall be valid notwithstanding that the person to whom the testamentary disposition relates dies before it is sealed with the seal of the court so long as the terms of the testamentary disposition accord with the directions of the court.
    
    (8) A testamentary disposition authorised and executed in accordance with this section shall continue to have effect, until it is revoked, notwithstanding that the person to whom it relates has ceased to be subject to a property order.
    
    Section 55(5): substituted, on 1 November 2007, by [section 41][197] of the Wills Act 2007 (2007 No 36).

##### 57 Proceedings, execution, etc, not to proceed without leave of court
    
*   (1) From the date on which an application is made for a property order in respect of any person, no person shall, without the leave of a court,---

    *   (b) issue any execution, attach any debt, or otherwise enforce or seek to enforce any judgment or order (not being a judgment or order given under this Act) against the person in respect of whom the application is made; or
    
    *   (c) enter into possession, sell, appoint a receiver, or take or continue any power or right under or in pursuance of any mortgage, charge, instrument, or other security over the property of the person in respect of whom the application is made; or
    
    *   (d) determine or forfeit any tenancy, retake or re-enter any premises, or take or continue any power or right under or in pursuance of any lease, tenancy, or agreement to let or lease against the property of the person in respect of whom the application is made.
    
    (2) This section shall also apply to a company and its property, and to any subsidiary of a company and the subsidiary's property, where the person in respect of whom the application is made is a member of the company and holds more than 50% of its equity share capital or issued shares, as the case may be.

##### 58 Notional preservation of character of assets converted
    
*   (1) Where any property (including money) is derived from any sale, mortgage, charge, or other disposition of any other property belonging to a person subject to a property order pursuant to any powers conferred by or under this Act or any former corresponding Act, the person whose property is so disposed of, and anyone claiming through that person, shall have the same interest in the property so derived, so far as it has not been applied or spent or disposed of in accordance with any powers so conferred, as he or she would have had in the property disposed of if no disposition had been made, and the surplus property so derived shall be deemed to be of the same nature as the property disposed of.
    
    (2) In any such case, the manager may, for the purpose of giving better effect to the provisions of subsection (1), carry to a separate account an amount representing the property so derived, or any balance for the time being remaining.
    
    (3) While an amount stands to the credit of that separate account, any payments from the property of the person subject to a property order shall be made out of any other property properly available for the purpose, except so far as the manager decides that the payment should be made wholly or partly from the separate account.
    
    (4) Subject to subsection (5), this section shall apply in all cases, whether the property was so derived before or after the commencement of this Act, but shall not apply to any property so derived by the disposition of any property belonging to a mentally defective person who died before 18 October 1957 (being the date of the commencement of the Mental Health Amendment Act 1957), unless the court had, in the lifetime of that person, made an order that would have been authorised by [section 60][68] if it had then been in force.

    *   (b) repaying money secured by a mortgage or other charge over such property,---
    
    shall be a charge upon the property, but so that no right of sale during the lifetime of the person shall be conferred by the charge.
    
    (2) The charge may include interest on the money if the court thinks fit, and the court may give directions regarding payment of interest.
    
    (3) The charge may take effect in favour of a person as trustee for the person subject to a property order as part of that latter person's personal estate or of a specified part thereof.

*   (1) A court shall have power, in the management of the property of a person subject to a property order, to make such orders as it thinks fit for the purpose of preserving the nature, quality, tenure, and devolution of the property or of any part of it.
    
    (2) Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), a court may direct that any money shall be carried to a separate account, and may declare the notional character that the money in that account bears, and may order such assurances and things to be executed and done as it thinks expedient.
    
    (3) At any time before the death of the person subject to a property order, and whether or not he or she is still subject to such an order, the court may vary or discharge the order, and give any consequential directions.

##### 61 Termination of notional preservation of character of assets
    
*   (1) [Section 58][66] shall cease to apply to any capital money, and any charge on property created under an order of the court made under [section 59][67] shall be extinguished, and any order of the court made under [section 60][68] shall cease to have effect, if, at any time after section 58 became applicable to the capital money, or the charge came into existence, or the order was made, as the case may be (in this section referred to as a subsequent time), the person subject to a property order has been entitled for any continuous period of 12 months to manage the capital money, or the property charged, or the money or other property affected by the order, as the case may be.
    
    (2) If the person subject to a property order has not been so entitled, [section 58][66] shall continue to apply to any of his or her capital money to which it has become applicable, and any such charge or order shall continue to exist and have effect, except so far as the person has, at any subsequent time, while having the necessary capacity to do so,---
        
    *   (a) made a valid testamentary disposition of, or paid or transferred to any other person beneficially, the capital money or the property charged or the money or other property affected by the order, as the case may be; or
    
    *   (b) in the case of property charged, released the charge.
    
    (3) This section shall not limit or affect any power of the court under [section 59][67] or [section 60][68] to vary or discharge any such charge or order.
    
    (4) Subsection (2) shall have effect whether or not the person continues to be subject to a property order or to be entitled to manage all or any of his or her money and other property.

##### 62 Court may settle the beneficial interests of person subject to property order
    
*   (1) A court may direct a settlement to be made of all or any of the property of a person subject to a property order on such trusts and subject to such powers and provisions as the court may think fit; and, in particular, the court may give such directions---
        
    *   (a) where the property has been acquired under a settlement or will, or on intestacy, or represents property so acquired; or
    
    *   (b) where,---
            
        *   (i) by reason of any change in the law or of any change in circumstances since the execution by the person of a testamentary disposition; or
        
        *   (ii) by reason of any absence of information at the time of that execution; or
        
        *   (iii) on account of the former management of the property or the expenditure of money in improving or maintaining it; or
        
        *   (iv) for any other special reason,---
        
        the court is satisfied that the devolution or distribution of the property of the person, either under any testamentary disposition or on intestacy, would be such as might cause injustice or hardship to any person.
    
    (2) A court may direct the transfer by way of gift of any of the property of a person subject to a property order for the maintenance and benefit of members of the person's family or for the provision of other persons or purposes for whom or which the person might be expected to provide if he or she were able to manage his or her own affairs in relation to his or her property.
    
    (3) A court may direct the manager, to execute any transfer or other instrument, and to do any other act or thing, that may be required for giving effect to the transfer or settlement, in the name and on behalf of the person, and for that purpose may make a vesting order or appoint a person to convey; and any settlement or transfer approved by the court shall be as effectual and binding on all persons interested as if it had been made by the person while of full competence.
    
    (4) This section applies whether or not the person has executed a testamentary disposition and notwithstanding that it is not known whether the person has executed such a disposition or not, but does not apply when the person is a minor who is not married or in a civil union.
    
    (5) An application to a court for an order under this section may be made by any of the following persons:
        
    *   (a) any person who has or would have had any interest in the property of the person subject to a property order or any expectation of succession to any such property, whether that interest or expectation arises or could have arisen under a testamentary disposition that is known to exist or in the event of the intestacy of the person:
    
    *   (b) the manager:
    
    *   (c) any other person who adduces proof of circumstances that, in the opinion of the court, make it proper that that person should make the application.
    
    (6) Subject to making due provision for the maintenance of the person subject to a property order in accordance with his or her means and way of life, whether out of the capital or income of the property settled or other property or partly in one way and partly in another, and to providing, by means of a power of appointment or revocation, or otherwise, for the possibility of the person recovering full competence to manage his or her own affairs in relation to his or her property, the court may, in making any order under this section, have regard to all or any of the following matters:
        
    *   (a) the manner in which the property has been settled or dealt with on former occasions:
    
    *   (b) in the case of any land or business, the welfare of the persons employed in connection with the land or business, and the expediency of settling other assets to devolve with the land or business:
    
    *   (c) the provisions of any testamentary disposition of the person subject to a property order:
    
    *   (d) the expediency of providing for---

        *   (ii) the continuation or provision of any superannuation or pension, and the application of any part of the income for charitable purposes:
        
        *   (iii) discretionary trusts, trusts for effecting or maintaining policies of insurance, powers of appointment, sinking funds for making good any losses (instead of or in addition to insurance), or any other purposes:
        
        *   (iv) the extension of any statutory powers of investment, management, or otherwise:

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Protection of Personal and Property Rights Act 1988\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 7 July 2010, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][276] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][277] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][278] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][279] and [17E][280] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
