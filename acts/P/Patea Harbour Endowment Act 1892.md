An Act to vest certain Land in the Patea Harbour Board.
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    WHEREAS the land described in the Schedule hereto was, on or about the first day of July, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-five, set aside as a reserve for a pilot-station and purposes connected therewith, and the same was intended and has been used for purposes connected with and as an endowment for the Patea Harbour, and it is expedient to vest the same in the Patea Harbour Board:

BE IT THEREFORE ENACTED by the General Assembly of New Zealand in Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:---

##### 1 Short Title
    
*   The Short Title of this Act is The Patea Harbour Endowment Act 1892\.

##### 2 Land set aside as endowment
    
*   The lands described in the Schedule to this Act are hereby vested in the Patea Harbour Board as an endowment for the Patea Harbour.

##### 3 Power to lease
    
*   It shall be lawful for the Patea Harbour Board to lease any portion or portions of the said land not required for a pilot-station in manner prescribed by The Harbours Act 1878\.

##### 4 Confirmation of existing leases
    
*   All leases of the said land, or any portion thereof, heretofore granted by the Governor or the Minister of Marine are hereby declared to be good leases.

##### 5 Power to extend existing or to grant new leases
    
*   If any person having a lease of any portion of the said land from the Governor or the Minister aforesaid, or from an intermediate lessee, shall be desirous of erecting or extending any buildings or improvements upon any part thereof, and the term of his present lease shall not in the opinion of the Board be such as to justify him in carrying out his intended buildings or improvements, the Board may, with the consent of the Governor, agree with such lessee upon condition that he shall forthwith effect such extension for an extended lease of the whole or a part of the land held by him for any term not exceeding twenty-one years; and such extended lease may contain a provision for the payment to the lessee upon the determination by effluxion of time of his lease by the Board or the incoming lessee of the value of improvements, erected during the term of such extended lease. The annual rent to be received for any such renewal lease shall not be less than ten dollars per centum upon the capital value of the land without the buildings or improvements belonging to the lessee; and such lease shall contain such covenants, conditions, and agreements as may be approved between the Board and such lessee.
    
    The reference to ""ten dollars"" was substituted, as from 10 July 1967, for a reference to ""five pounds"" pursuant to section [7(1)][8] of the Decimal Currency Act 1964 (1964 No 27).
