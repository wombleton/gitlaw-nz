# Public Finance Amendment Act 2004Public Act2004 No 113

Date of assent21 December 2004

Commencementsee section 2

##### 1 Title
    
*   (1) This Act is the [Public Finance Amendment Act 2004][469].
    
    (2) In this Act, the Public Finance Act 1989 is called ""the principal Act"".

##### 2 Commencement
    
*   This Act comes into force on 25 January 2005\.

#### Transitional provisions

##### 32 Application of provisions relating to financial year
    
*   (1) Despite the enactment of this Act, any existing provisions of the principal Act that relate to a financial year continue to apply only in respect of---
        
    *   (a) either of the following:
            
        *   (i) the financial year ending on 30 June 2005; or
        
        *   (ii) a later financial year specified by the Governor-General by Order in Council made on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) each previous financial year.
    
    (2) Any provisions of the principal Act (as amended by this Act) that relate to a financial year must be read as if those provisions apply only in respect of---
        
    *   (a) either of the following:
            
        *   (i) the financial year commencing on 1 July 2005; or
        
        *   (ii) if a later financial year is specified by the Governor-General by Order in Council made under subsection (1)(a)(ii), the next financial year; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) each subsequent financial year.
    
    (3) The Minister of Finance may make a recommendation under subsection (1)(a)(ii) only if he or she is satisfied that doing so is reasonably necessary to maintain the integrity of the preparation of the Budget.
    
    (4) In this section, _existing provisions of the principal Act_ means the provisions of the principal Act that were in force immediately before the commencement of this Act.

##### 33 Reporting obligations in respect of financial year
    
*   (1) The reporting requirements and provisions that would have applied if this Act had not been enacted continue to apply, in respect of the financial year specified in subsection (3), to a department and an Office of Parliament, rather than the reporting requirements and provisions enacted by this Act or any other Act.
    
    (2) Therefore, for example, a department and an Office of Parliament must comply with the requirements relating to annual financial statements, annual reports, and audits that were in the principal Act immediately before the commencement of this Act.
    
    (3) The financial year referred to in subsection (1) is---
        
    *   (a) the financial year ending on 30 June 2005; or
    
    *   (b) if a later financial year is specified by the Governor-General by Order in Council made under section 32(1)(a)(ii), that financial year.
    
    (4) To avoid doubt, this section does not limit section 32\.
    
    (5) Section 198 of the Crown Entities Act 2004 applies to an organisation named or described in Schedule 4\.

##### 34 Existing bank accounts, investments, borrowing, guarantees, and derivatives
    
*   (1) This section applies to any bank account, investment, borrowing, guarantee, or derivative transaction of an organisation that is named or described in Schedule 4 of the principal Act at the date of commencement of this Act that the organisation would be restricted from acquiring, giving, or entering into under this Act.
    
    (2) The bank account, investment, borrowing, guarantee, or derivative transaction is not affected by the enactment of this Act.
    
    (3) However, the terms of the investment, borrowing, guarantee, or derivative transaction may be amended, or any options resulting from the investment, borrowing, or derivative transaction, may be taken up, only if permitted by the Minister of Finance.

##### 35 Regulations for transitional and savings purposes
    
*   (1) The Governor-General may, by Order in Council, make regulations prescribing transitional or savings provisions relating to the coming into force of this Act.
    
    (2) Any transitional or savings provisions prescribed in regulations made under subsection (1) may be in addition to or in place of any of the provisions of sections 32 to 34\.

##### 36 References in trust deeds to section 25 of principal Act
    
*   Every reference to section 25 of the principal Act that is in a trust deed at the date of commencement of this section must be read as a reference to section 161 of the Crown Entities Act 2004\.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Public Finance Act 1989\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 8 March 2013, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][470] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][471] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][472] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][473] and [17E][474] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
