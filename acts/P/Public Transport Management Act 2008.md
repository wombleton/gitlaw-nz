        *   (ii) has properly considered the impact of the control on existing commercial services in the region and the operators of those services; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) the regional council is satisfied that---

    *   (b) the contracted public transport services are provided under separate contracts; and

    (7) If a regional council has reasonable grounds to believe that the inclusion of a control in a regional public transport plan may result in the withdrawal of an existing commercial service that is described in the plan, the regional council may only include the control in the plan if---
        
    *   (a) there is a similar public transport service available to users of the existing commercial service; or
    
    *   (b) the plan states that the regional council intends that, if the existing commercial service is withdrawn, it will replace it with a similar public transport service.

        *   (i) operates outside the region to which the regional public transport plan applies; or
        
        *   (ii) is specified by regulations made under this Act as an exempt commercial public transport service for the purposes of this section; or

    (11) A control may, subject to subsection (10), apply to any commercial public transport service, whether or not the service is described in the regional public transport plan as a public transport service that the regional council proposes to be provided in its region.
    
    (12) A control is not a regulation for the purposes of the [Regulations (Disallowance) Act 1989][103].
    
    (13) For the purposes of this section, _operating costs_ means the cost to an operator of operating a public transport service before any revenue is taken into account.

    (3) A regional council may not include a contracting requirement in a regional public transport plan that applies to a public transport service that operates outside the region to which the regional public transport plan applies.

##### 24 Effect of amendments to, or replacement of, material incorporated by reference in regional public transport plans
    
*   An amendment to, or replacement of, material incorporated by reference in a regional public transport plan has legal effect as part of the plan only if the plan is varied to state that the amendment or replacement has that effect.

##### 25 Proof of material incorporated by reference
    
*   (1) A copy of material incorporated by reference in a regional public transport plan, including any amendment to, or replacement of, the material, must be---
        
    *   (a) certified by the chief executive or an authorised officer of the regional council as a correct copy of the material incorporated by reference; and
    
    *   (b) retained by the regional council.
    
    (2) The production in proceedings of a certified copy of the material is, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, sufficient evidence that the material is incorporated by reference in the regional public transport plan.

##### 26 Effect of expiry of material incorporated by reference
    
*   Material incorporated by reference in a regional public transport plan and that expires, is revoked, or ceases to have effect, ceases to have legal effect as part of the plan only if the plan is varied to state that the material ceases to have effect.

    (3) If the provision in a regional public transport plan that incorporates material by reference is a control, and that material was not readily available during consultation to the public from other sources, a failure to comply with this section invalidates that control; but any other failure to comply with this section does not invalidate all or part of a plan.

##### 37 Grounds for declining to vary registered commercial public transport services

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Public Transport Management Act 2008\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 27 November 2010, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][150] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][151] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][152] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][153] and [17E][154] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
