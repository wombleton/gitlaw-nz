    *   (b) any such lease is surrendered by the lessee or is determined by the leasing authority by re-entry or forfeiture,---
    
    the lessee shall be entitled in accordance with this section to compensation from the incoming lessee or the leasing authority, as the case may be, for improvements on the land effected or purchased by him.
    
    (2) In every such case the leasing authority shall cause a valuation of the improvements on the land effected or purchased by the lessee to be made by a person whom the leasing authority reasonably believes to be competent to make the valuation.
    
    (3) As soon as possible after that valuation has been made, the leasing authority shall give to the lessee notice in writing informing him of the amount of that valuation and, except where the lease has been determined by re-entry or forfeiture, requiring him to notify the leasing authority in writing within 2 months whether he agrees to the amount of that valuation or requires that valuation to be determined by arbitration in accordance with subsection (4).
    
    (4) Within 2 months after the giving of that notice to the lessee, he shall give notice in writing to the leasing authority stating whether he agrees to the valuation specified in the notice given to him or requires that valuation to be determined by arbitration. If he so requires, that valuation shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of [clauses 7 to 11][47] of Schedule 1, which shall, with the necessary modifications, apply as if the valuation were being made to determine the rent payable under a renewal lease:
    
    provided that this subsection shall not apply in any case where the lease has been determined by re-entry or forfeiture.
    
    (5) If the lessee fails to give to the leasing authority within the time specified in subsection (4) the notice referred in that subsection, he shall be deemed to have agreed to the valuation set out in the notice given to him under subsection (3).
    
    (6) Where in any case to which subsection (1) applies the land is to be again leased by the leasing authority under [paragraph (b) of section 11][14],---
        
    *   (a) it shall be offered for lease weighted with the value of improvements effected or purchased by the former lessee as fixed under the foregoing provisions of this section:
        
        provided that, in any case where the lease has been determined by re-entry or forfeiture, if the leasing authority believes on reasonable grounds that the granting of a new lease of the land is being hindered by reason of the value of improvements as determined under subsection (2) being excessive, the leasing authority, in its discretion, may from time to time reduce the value of the improvements and again offer the land for lease by public application:
    
    *   (b) the value of those improvements shall be paid to the leasing authority by the incoming lessee before he is admitted into possession of the land:
        
        provided that, with the consent of the former lessee and of every person entitled to receive payment of any amount in respect of the whole or any part of those improvements, the said value or any part thereof may be paid by instalments over a period of years or be secured by way of mortgage to the former lessee or other person entitled. Any payment by instalments over a period of years shall be subject to such conditions as to payment of interest and otherwise, and any mortgage shall contain such provisions, as the leasing authority thinks fit:
    
    *   (c) the value of those improvements when so paid to the leasing authority shall be paid by it to the former lessee or other person entitled to receive payment, less any money due to the leasing authority by the former lessee in respect of the land and improvements and less the amount of any expenses incurred by the leasing authority in recovering possession of the land.
    
    (7) Where in any case to which subsection (1) applies the leasing authority decides that the land is not to be again leased under [paragraph (b) of section 11][14], the value of the improvements on the land effected or purchased by the former lessee, as fixed under the foregoing provisions of this section, shall be paid by the leasing authority to the former lessee or other person entitled to receive payment, less any money due to the leasing authority by the former lessee in respect of the land and improvements and less any expenses incurred by the leasing authority in recovering possession of the land.
    
    (8) Except as provided in subsections (6) and (7), no lessee shall have any right or claim against the leasing authority in respect of any improvements effected or purchased by him on land comprised in any land leased under [paragraph (b) of section 11][14].
    
    (9) In this section the term _improvements_ means substantial improvements of a permanent nature; and includes reclamation from swamps; clearing of bush, gorse, broom, sweetbrier, or scrub; cultivation (including the clearing of land for cropping, and the clearing and ploughing of land for, and the laying down of the land for or with, grasses); planting with trees or live hedges; the laying out and cultivating of gardens; fencing; draining; roading; bridging; sinking water wells or bores, or constructing water tanks, water supplies, water races, irrigation works, head races, border dykes, or sheep dips; making embankments or protective works of any kind; in any way improving the character or fertility of the soil; the erection of any building; and the installation of any telephone or of any electric-lighting or electric-power plant.
    
    (10) In this section the term _value of improvements_ means the added value which at the time of valuation the improvements give to the land; and _valuation_, in relation to improvements, has a corresponding meaning.

##### 15 Land to be properly farmed
    
*   In every renewable lease of farm land granted or renewed after the commencement of this Act by any lessor which is a leasing authority or a public body, whether the lease is granted or renewed under this Act or any other enactment, there shall be implied on the part of the lessee that he will throughout the term of the lease---
        
    *   (a) farm the land diligently and in a husbandlike manner according to the rules of good husbandry, and will not in any way commit waste, except pursuant to an express provision in the lease authorising the lessee to commit waste:

    (2) Every person who obstructs any person authorised as aforesaid in the making of an inspection, or who refuses to answer any reasonable question put to him in writing by any person so authorised, or who makes to him any wilful mis-statement, commits an offence, and is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding $100\.

*   Before the expiry by effluxion of time of the term hereby granted, the right to a lease of the land hereby demised for a further term of \[_the period specified in [clause 1][57] of these presents_\], containing the same covenants and provisions as are contained in this lease (including the provisions herein contained for valuations and for the offer of a new lease for sale by auction, and all clauses auxiliary or in relation thereto), shall be offered by the lessor by public auction at the upset annual rent of the said land \[_where the rent is to be reviewed at periodic intervals, insert_ for the first \[_number_\] years of the term of the lease\] as determined as aforesaid, without the buildings and improvements so valued as aforesaid, subject to the payment by the purchaser of the value of the said buildings and improvements as determined as aforesaid. \[_Where the rent is to be reviewed at periodic intervals, add_ The rent for subsequent periods of \[_number_\] years of the term of the lease shall be determined in accordance with [section 22][26] of the Public Bodies Leases Act 1969.\]

##### 11
    
*   If any person other than the lessee becomes the purchaser at the said auction of the said right to a lease, that person shall within 2 calendar months from the date of the auction pay in cash to the lessor, in trust for the lessee, the amount of the value of the buildings and improvements so determined as aforesaid, and accept and execute a lease of the said land for the said further term at the annual ground rent \[_where the rent is to be reviewed at periodic intervals, insert_ for the first \[_number_\] years of the term of the lease\] at which the right to the said lease has been so purchased by him.

##### 12
    
*   The lessor shall on demand (all rent and outgoings payable by the lessee having previously been paid) pay over to the outgoing lessee the amount of the value of the said buildings and improvements paid to the lessor by the said purchaser without any deduction whatever.

##### 13
    
*   Nothing in these presents contained shall be deemed to render the lessor liable to pay to the lessee any part of the value of any buildings or improvements save after having received the amount thereof as aforesaid.

##### 14
    
*   Upon any sale by auction as aforesaid of the right to a lease, the lessor may make usual and any other fair and reasonable conditions of sale to carry out the intention of these presents, and in particular shall provide for the payment by the purchaser at the auction (if a person other than the outgoing lessee) of a deposit of one-fifth of the amount of the valuation of the buildings and improvements, or of such smaller deposit as is agreed upon between the lessor and the outgoing lessee, and that in the event of the purchaser refusing or neglecting to complete his purchase according to the conditions of sale he shall forfeit his deposit to the lessor for the benefit of the outgoing lessee.

##### 15
    
*   In any such conditions of sale the lessor may in addition provide that, if the purchaser refuses or neglects to complete the purchase according to the conditions of sale, he shall pay to and for the benefit of the lessor as liquidated damages a sum not exceeding one-half of the total deficiency (if any) during the term of years of the rent agreed to be paid by the new purchaser at a subsequent sale by auction held in consequence of the default of the original purchaser, as compared with the rent that would have been reserved had such original purchaser not made default, together with all expenses attending the first sale. \[_Where the rent is to be reviewed at periodic intervals, add_ For the purposes of this clause, the annual rent payable during the first \[_number_\] years of any such lease shall be deemed to be payable throughout the whole term of the lease.\]

##### 16
    
*   If, for any reason whatsoever, the right to a new lease is not offered at auction before the expiry of the term hereby granted, or if, owing to the purchaser, other than the outgoing lessee, at any auction (whether the original auction or a subsequent one held on account of the default of the purchaser to complete) refusing or neglecting to complete his purchase according to the terms and conditions thereof, the purchase is not completed, then and in any such case the right to the new lease shall be offered at auction as soon as conveniently can be after the expiry of the term hereby granted or (as the case may be) after such refusal or neglect as aforesaid, notwithstanding that the term hereby granted has expired.

##### 17
    
*   If the purchaser at the last-mentioned auction, being any person other than the outgoing lessee, makes default as aforesaid, the right to the new lease shall again be offered at auction as soon as conveniently can be after such default, and so on from time to time.

##### 18
    
*   In every case in which the right to a new lease is sold by auction the new term shall run from the date of the expiration of the term hereby granted, but the rent shall not begin to run until the purchaser obtains possession.

##### 19
    
*   The outgoing lessee shall have a right to bid for and to become the purchaser of the right to a new lease at any such auction.

##### 20
    
*   The lessor shall be bound in all cases to accept at any such auction the highest bid made thereat for the new lease, if that bid is not less than the upset annual ground rent as determined in manner aforesaid.

##### 21
    
*   If at any auction there is no bid equal to or greater than the upset annual ground rent as determined in manner aforesaid, then, at or (as the case may be) as from the expiry of the term hereby granted, the land hereby leased, with all buildings and improvements thereon (other than fixtures removable by the outgoing lessee before the expiration of the term), shall absolutely revert to the lessor free from any payment or compensation whatever.

##### 22
    
*   At every auction held under the foregoing provisions the conditions of sale shall be the same (so nearly as may be) as those in respect of the first auction hereinbefore provided for.

##### 23
    
*   In the event of the term hereby created being determined by forfeiture or otherwise than by effluxion of time, the lessee shall not be entitled to any compensation for buildings or improvements.

##### 24
    
*   Nothing in the foregoing provisions shall exclude or restrict the right of the lessee to obtain relief against any forfeiture or determination of the lease or of any right in respect thereof in the same cases and on the same conditions as if the lease had been granted otherwise than in the execution of statutory powers in that behalf.

##### 25
    
*   The expression _lessor_ as herein used includes the successors and assigns of the lessor, and the term _lessee_ as herein used includes the successors, executors, administrators, and assigns of the lessee.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Public Bodies Leases Act 1969\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 7 July 2004, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][65] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][66] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][67] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][68] and [17E][69] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
