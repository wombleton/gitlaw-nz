## Part 1  
The general law relating to partners

#### Nature of partnership

##### 4 Definition of partnership
    
*   (1) Partnership is the relation which subsists between persons carrying on a business in common with a view to profit.
    
    (2) But the relation between members of any company or association registered as a company under the Companies Act 1955 or the [Companies Act 1993][76] or any other Act of the General Assembly for the time being in force and relating to the registration of joint stock, trading, or mining companies, or formed or incorporated by or in pursuance of any other Act of the General Assembly or letters patent, or Royal Charter, is not a partnership within the meaning of this Act.
    
    Compare: 1891 No 6 s 4; Partnership Act 1890, s 1 (UK)
    
    Subsection (2) has been amended by substituting the Companies Act 1955 for the repealed Companies Act 1908\.
    
    Subsection (2) was amended, as from 1 July 1994, by [section 2][77] Company Law Reform (Transitional Provisions) Act 1994 (1994 No 16) by inserting the words ""or the Companies Act 1993"".

##### 5 Rules for determining existence of partnership
    
*   In determining whether a partnership does or does not exist regard shall be had to the following rules:
        
    *   (a) Joint tenancy, tenancy in common, joint property, or part ownership does not of itself create a partnership as to anything so held or owned, whether the tenants or owners do or do not share any profits made by the use thereof:
    
    *   (b) The sharing of gross returns does not of itself create a partnership, whether the persons sharing such returns have or have not a joint or common right or interest in any property from which or from the use of which the returns are derived:
    
    *   (c) The receipt by a person of a share of the profits of a business is prima facie evidence that he is a partner in the business, but the receipt of such a share or of a payment contingent on or varying with the profits of a business does not of itself make him a partner in the business and, in particular,---
            
        *   (i) The receipt by a person of a debt or other liquidated amount, by instalments or otherwise, out of the accruing profits of a business does not of itself make him a partner in the business or liable as such:
        
        *   (ii) A contract for the remuneration of a servant or agent of a person engaged in a business by a share of the profits of the business does not of itself make the servant or agent a partner in the business or liable as such:
        
        *   (iii) A person being the widow, widower, surviving civil union partner, surviving de facto partner, or child of a deceased partner, and receiving by way of annuity a portion of the profits made in the business in which the deceased person was a partner, is not by reason only of such receipt a partner in the business or liable as such:
        
        *   (iv) The advance of money by way of loan to a person engaged or about to engage in any business on a contract with that person that the lender shall receive a rate of interest varying with the profits, or shall receive a share of the profits arising from carrying on the business, does not of itself make the lender a partner with the person or persons carrying on the business, or liable as such:
            
            Provided that the contract is in writing, and signed by or on behalf of all the parties thereto:
        
        *   (v) A person receiving by way of annuity or otherwise a portion of the profits of a business in consideration of the sale by him of the goodwill of the business is not, by reason only of such receipt, a partner in the business or liable as such.
        
        
    
    Compare: 1891 No 6 s 5; Partnership Act 1890, s 2 (UK)
    
    Paragraph (c)(iii) was amended, as from 26 April 2005, by [section 7][78] Relationships (Statutory References) Act 2005 (2005 No 3) by inserting the words "", widower, surviving civil union partner, surviving de facto partner,"" after the word ""widow"".

##### 6 Rights of person lending or selling in consideration of share of profits in case of bankruptcy
    
*   In the event of any person to whom money has been advanced by way of loan upon such a contract as is mentioned in the last preceding section, or of any buyer of a goodwill in consideration of a share of the profits of the business, being adjudged a bankrupt, entering into an arrangement to pay his creditors less than 100 cents in the dollar, or dying in insolvent circumstances, the lender of the loan shall not be entitled to recover anything in respect of his loan, and the seller of the goodwill shall not be entitled to recover anything in respect of the share of profits contracted for, until the claims of the other creditors of the borrower or buyer for valuable consideration in money or money's worth have been satisfied.
    
    Compare: 1891 No 6 s 6; Partnership Act 1890, s 3 (UK)
    
    Section 6 was amended, as from 10 July 1967, by section 14(1) Decimal Currency Amendment Act 1965 (1965 No 124) by substituting the words ""100 cents in the dollar"" for the words ""twenty shillings in the pound"".

##### 7 Meaning of ""firm""
    
*   Persons who have entered into partnership with one another are for the purposes of this Act called collectively a ""firm"", and the name under which their business is carried on is called the ""firm name"".

*   Every partner is an agent of the firm and his other partners for the purpose of the business of the partnership; and the acts of every partner who does any act for carrying on in the usual way business of the kind carried on by the firm of which he is a member bind the firm and his partners, unless the partner so acting has in fact no authority to act for the firm in the particular matter, and the person with whom he is dealing either knows that he has no authority or does not know or believe him to be a partner.
    
    Compare: 1891 No 6 s 8; Partnership Act 1890, s 5 (UK)

*   An act or instrument relating to the business of the firm, and done or executed in the firm name, or in any other manner showing an intention to bind the firm, by any person thereto authorised, whether a partner or not, is binding on the firm and all the partners:
    
    Provided that this section shall not affect any general rule of law relating to the execution of deeds or negotiable instruments.
    
    Compare: 1891 No 6 s 9; Partnership Act 1890, s 6 (UK)

##### 10 Partner using credit of firm for private purposes
    
*   Where one partner pledges the credit of the firm for a purpose apparently not connected with the firm's ordinary course of business, the firm is not bound unless he is in fact specially authorised by the other partners; but this section does not affect any personal liability incurred by an individual partner.
    
    Compare: 1891 No 6 s 10; Partnership Act 1890, s 7 (UK)

##### 11 Effect of notice that firm will not be bound by acts of partner

    Compare: 1891 No 6 s 13; Partnership Act 1890, s 10 (UK)

##### 14 Misapplication of money received for firm, etc
    
*   In the following cases, namely,---
        
    *   (a) Where one partner acting within the scope of his apparent authority receives the money or property of a third person and misapplies it; and
    
    *   (b) Where a firm in the course of its business receives money or property of a third person, and the money or property so received is misapplied by one or more of the partners while it is in the custody of the firm,---
    
    the firm is liable to make good the loss.
    
    Compare: 1891 No 6 s 14; Partnership Act 1890, s 11 (UK)

    (2) Provided that where after a partner's death the partnership business is continued in the old firm name, the continued use of that name or of the deceased partner's name as part thereof shall not of itself make his executors' or administrators' estate or effects liable for any partnership debts contracted after his death.
    
    Compare: 1891 No 6 s 17; Partnership Act 1890, s 14 (UK)

##### 18 Admissions and representations of partners
