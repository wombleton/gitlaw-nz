    (2) If, in the opinion of the Registrar, the vendor mortgagee unreasonably withdraws from sale the whole or any part of the land proposed to be sold, the Registrar must disallow all or part of the expenses of, and incidental to, the sale as the Registrar thinks fit.

    (2) [Sections 208 to 215][242] and [217 to 224][252] apply to every lease or sublease of land that comes into operation on or after 1 January 2008\.
    
    (3) [Sections 214][248], [243 to 264][282], and [273][314] apply, with all necessary modifications, to a licence as if every reference in those sections---
        
    *   (a) to a lease were a reference to a licence; and
    
    *   (b) to a lessee were a reference to a licensee; and
    
    *   (c) to a lessor were a reference to a licensor.
    
    (4) However, [sections 214][248], [243 to 264][282], and [273][314] do not confer on a licensee any estate or interest in land.

##### 207 Interpretation

    _condition_, in relation to a lease,---
        
    *   (a) means a covenant, condition, or power expressed or implied in the lease; and
    
    *   (b) includes, for the purposes of [sections 243 to 264][282], and [273][314] any such provision under which an act or omission of the lessee or any other person (except an act or omission that is a breach of a covenant of the lessee), or a specified event (except the expiry of the term of the lease), is a ground for the cancellation of the lease (and a breach of a condition includes the commission of that act, or the occurrence of that omission or event)
    
    _covenant_, in relation to a lease, means a promise expressed or implied in the lease

        *   (i) a lease for a term of 1 year or less; or
        
        *   (ii) a periodic tenancy for periods of 1 year or less; or
        
        *   (iii) a statutory tenancy

    Compare: 1952 No 51 [ss 117][627], [120(1), (2)][628]

### Subpart 2---Form, duration, and effect of leases

##### 208 Short-term lease: form
    
*   A short-term lease may be made orally or in writing.

##### 209 Short-term lease: effect
    
*   (1) A lessee who occupies land under a short-term lease has a legal interest in the land.
    
    (2) However, subsection (1) is subject to the [Land Transfer Act 1952][452].
    
    (3) The legal interest in the land of a lessee under a short-term lease who has given valuable consideration has priority in relation to any unregistered interest in the land---
        
    *   (a) that was created before the lessee entered into occupation of the land if---
            
        *   (i) the lessee entered into occupation of the land in good faith and without actual notice of the unregistered interest; and
        
        *   (ii) no caveat for the unregistered interest was lodged against the title to the land at the time when the lessee entered into occupation of the land; or
        
        
    
    *   (b) that is created after the lessee has entered into occupation of the land.
    
    

##### 210 Implied term of lease if no other term agreed
    
*   (1) This section applies to a lease if---
        
    *   (a) the lessee is in possession of the land, although the lessor and the lessee have not agreed, expressly or by implication, on the duration of the term of the lease; or
    
    *   (b) the lessee remains in possession of the land with the lessor's consent, although the term of the lease has expired and the lessor and the lessee have not agreed, expressly or by implication, that the lessee may continue in possession for some other period.
    
    (2) A lease to which this section applies---
        
    *   (a) is terminable at will; and
    
    *   (b) may be terminated, at any time, by the lessor or the lessee giving not less than 20 working days' written notice to the other party to the lease.
    
    Compare: 1952 No 51 [s 105][629]

##### 211 Obligations of lessee to remain in force if lessee remains in possession of land with lessor's consent after term of lease has expired
    
*   If [section 210(1)(b)][244] applies, all the obligations of the lessee under the lease that are consistent with the lease being terminable at will remain in force until the time that the lease is terminated in accordance with section 210(2).
    
    Compare: 1952 No 51 [s 105][629]

##### 212 Lease terminating on occurrence of future event
    
*   (1) A lease is not invalid only because it provides for its termination, or permits notice of its termination to be given, on the occurrence of a future event so long as the event is sufficiently defined in the lease that it can be identified when it occurs.
    
    (2) However, the lease terminates on the tenth anniversary of the date on which the term of the lease began (the _tenth anniversary date_) if that future event has not occurred before that date.
    
    (3) Subsection (2) does not apply to a lease that provides for its termination on, or for notice of its termination to be given on or before, a date that---
        
    *   (a) is fixed in the lease; and
    
    *   (b) is later than the tenth anniversary date.
    
    (4) A lease that is valid only because of the application of this section cannot be registered under the [Land Transfer Act 1952][452] but is to be treated for all purposes as creating an equitable estate in the land.

##### 213 Lessee remaining in possession without consent of lessor, or lessor accepting rent, after termination of lease
    
*   (1) A lessee who remains in possession of the land without the lessor's consent after the lease has been terminated or the term of the lease has expired is subject to all the obligations of the lessee under the lease until the time that the lessee ceases to be in possession of the land.
    
    (2) A lessor who accepts rent for any period after the lease has been terminated or the term of the lease has expired is not, only because of that fact, to be treated as having---
        
    *   (a) consented to the lessee remaining in possession of the land; or
    
    *   (b) given up any of the lessor's rights or remedies against the lessee for breach of a covenant or condition of the lease.
    
    Compare: 1986 No 120 [s 60][630]

##### 214 Notice by joint tenants
    
*   (1) This section applies to a notice of termination for a periodic tenancy that is entered into---
        
    *   (a) by 2 or more lessors as joint tenants; or
    
    *   (b) by 2 or more lessees as joint tenants.
    
    (2) A notice of termination to which this section applies may be given by 1 or more of the lessors or the lessees as joint tenants, on behalf of all the joint tenants, unless all the parties to the tenancy have agreed, expressly or by implication, to do otherwise.

##### 215 Sublease for same or longer term as term of superior lease
    
*   (1) This section applies to a sublease under a lease (the **superior lease**) if the sublease is entered into, or purportedly entered into,---
        
    *   (a) by a lessee under the superior lease; and
    
    *   (b) for a term that will expire at the same time as, or later than, the time at which the term of the superior lease expires.
    
    (2) A sublease to which this section applies does not, unless a contrary intention appears, operate as an assignment of the superior lease to the sublessee.
    
    (3) If the term of a sublease to which this section applies will expire later than the expiry of the term of the superior lease,---
        
    *   (a) the term of the sublease is reduced and will expire at the same time as the term of the superior lease; and
    
    *   (b) the sublease cannot be registered under the [Land Transfer Act 1952][452] but is to be treated for all purposes as creating an equitable estate in the land.
    
    (4) Subsection (3) does not affect any remedy that the sublessee may have for the reduction, in accordance with that subsection, of the term of the sublease.
    
    (5) If the term of the superior lease is extended or renewed, the term of the sublease is extended and will expire at the earlier of the time that---
        
    *   (a) the term of the extended or renewed superior lease is expressed to expire; or
    
    *   (b) the term of the sublease is expressed to expire.
    
    (6) Although the term of a sublease to which this section applies (as expressed, reduced, or extended by this section) expires at the same time as the term of the superior lease, the sublessor must be treated as having a reversion expectant on the sublease.

##### 216 Surrender of lease to enable new superior lease to be entered into not to affect sublease
    
*   (1) If a lease (_lease A_) is surrendered to allow a new lease (_lease B_) to be entered into with the same lessee, a sublease in respect of lease A does not also have to be surrendered if---
        
    *   (a) the term of the sublease, as expressed, will expire on or before the date on which the term of lease B will expire; or
    
    *   (b) the sublease may be terminated by the sublessor giving a notice of termination that takes effect on or before that date.
    
    (2) A sublease in respect of lease A continues in force as though it had been entered into in respect of lease B and all the rights and obligations under the sublease, including those that relate to any period before the surrender of lease A, continue to be enforceable.
    
    (3) However, subsection (2) does not apply to any obligation under the sublease that, because lease B has been entered into, is more onerous than it would have been had lease A not been surrendered.
    
    (4) For the purposes of this section, a sublease in respect of lease A includes any sublease entered into by a person deriving title through the lessee under lease A.
    
    (5) For the purposes of [section 117][631] of the Land Transfer Act 1952, a sublease in respect of lease A is an interest to which lease B is deemed to be subject.

### Subpart 3---Covenants, conditions, and powers implied in leases

##### 217 Application of sections 218 to 220
    
*   [Sections 218 to 220][253] apply, as the case requires, unless a contrary intention is expressed (whether in a lease or otherwise) in accordance with [section 279(2)][324] (construction and variation, etc, of implied covenants).
    
    Compare: 1952 No 51 [s 106][633]

##### 218 Covenants, conditions, and powers implied in all leases
    
*   (1) Every lease contains the implied covenants, conditions, and powers set out in [Part 2][634] of Schedule 3\.
    
    (2) The covenant set out in [clause 9][635] of Part 2 of Schedule 3 (lessee entitled to quiet enjoyment) that is implied in a lease under subsection (1) relates only to the acts and omissions of---
        
    *   (a) the lessor; and
    
    *   (b) all persons through whom the lessor derives title except by purchase for valuable consideration; and
    
    *   (c) all persons who claim, or may claim, through, under, or in trust for the lessor or any person referred to in paragraph (b).
    
    Compare: 1952 No 51 [s 106][633]

##### 219 Covenant implied in leases (except unregistered short-term leases)
    
*   Every lease other than a short-term lease that is not registered contains the covenant set out in [Part 3][636] of Schedule 3 (lessee to keep and yield up premises in existing condition).
    
    Compare: 1952 No 51 [s 106][633]

##### 220 Covenant implied in unregistered short-term leases
    
*   Every short-term lease that is not registered contains the covenant set out in [Part 4][637] of Schedule 3 (lessee to use premises reasonably).
    
    Compare: 1952 No 51 [s 106][633]

##### 221 Reference to usual covenants
    
*   In a lease, unless the context otherwise requires, a reference to usual covenants must be taken to be a reference to the covenants implied in that lease by---
        
    *   (a) [section 218][253]; and
    
    *   (b) [section 219][254] (for a lease that is not a short-term lease) or [section 220][255] (for a short-term lease).
    
    

##### 222 Time for payment of rent
    
*   The rent payable under a lease is payable monthly in advance (whether that rent is expressed as an annual amount or in another way) unless the lessor and the lessee agree otherwise.

##### 223 Effect of covenant to keep premises in good condition
    
*   In a lease, unless the context otherwise requires, a covenant to keep leased premises in good condition (or words to that effect) does not require the lessee to put the premises into good condition if they are not in good condition when the term of the lease begins.

##### 224 Consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed
    
*   (1) In a lease, unless the context otherwise requires, a covenant of the lessee not to do a thing without the lessor's consent must be taken as requiring the lessor---
        
    *   (a) not to unreasonably withhold consent to the doing of that thing by the lessee; and
    
    *   (b) within a reasonable time, to---
            
        *   (i) give the consent; or
        
        *   (ii) notify the lessee in writing that the consent is withheld.
        
        
    
    (2) This section does not affect the operation of a covenant referred to in [section 225][260].

##### 225 Application of sections 226 to 228
    
*   (1) [Sections 226 to 228][261] apply if there is a covenant in a lease that the lessee will not, without the consent of the lessor, do 1 or more of the following things:
        
    *   (a) transfer or assign the lease:
    
    *   (b) enter into a sublease:

    (2) [Sections 226 to 228][261] do not prevent a lease from including a covenant binding the lessee absolutely not to do any of the things referred to in subsection (1).
    
    (3) To avoid doubt, [sections 226 to 228][261] do not apply if, and to the extent that, a lease includes, in accordance with subsection (2), a covenant binding the lessee absolutely not to do any of the things referred to in subsection (1).

##### 226 Consent to assignment, etc, or change of use
    
*   (1) This section applies to a lessor who receives after 31 December 2007 an application by a lessee requesting the lessor's consent to do 1 or more of the things referred to in [section 225(1)(a) to (f)][260] (whether the lease came into operation before, on, or after that date).
    
    (2) The lessor---
        
    *   (a) must not unreasonably withhold consent to the doing of the thing or things specified in the application (whether or not the covenant expressly provides that consent must not unreasonably be withheld); and
    
    *   (b) must, within a reasonable time,---
            
        *   (i) give the consent; or

        *   (ii) imposes on the lessee any unreasonable condition or precondition; or
        
        
    
    *   (b) consent is withheld because the lessee---

    (2) Subsection (1) does not limit [section 226(2)(a)][261], nor does it prevent the lessor from requiring the lessee, if the lease so provides, to pay the reasonable legal or other expenses of the lessor in giving consent.
    
    (3) If the lessor refuses consent, or gives consent subject to a condition or precondition, the lessor must, on the written request of the lessee, promptly give the lessee written notice of the reasons for---

*   A term has no effect if it---
        
    *   (a) is expressed or implied in an instrument; and
    
    *   (b) conflicts with [section 225][260], [226][261], [227][262], or [228][263].
    
    

### Subpart 4---Effect on leases of transactions concerning reversion

##### 230 Merger of reversion not to affect remedies
    
*   (1) This section applies to a lease if the reversion expectant on the lease is merged in a remainder or other reversion, or in a future estate or interest in the land.
    
    (2) The person entitled to the estate or interest into which that reversion has merged has the same remedies for non-performance or non-observance of the covenants or conditions of the lease, and has the same rights to give notice to the lessee of termination of the lease, as the person who would for the time being (but for the merger) have been entitled to the reversion expectant on the lease would have had.
    
    Compare: 1952 No 51 [s 111][640]

##### 231 Burden of lessor's covenants to run with reversion

    *   (b) may be enforced by the person who is from time to time entitled to the leasehold estate or interest against the person who is from time to time entitled to the reversion.
    
    (2) Subsection (1) applies unless a contrary intention appears from the lease or from another circumstance.
    
    (3) In subsection (1), the reference to every covenant of the lessor is,---
        
    *   (a) for a lease that comes into operation before 1 January 2008, a reference to every covenant of the lessor that refers to the subject matter of the lease; and
    
    *   (b) for a lease that comes into operation on or after that date, a reference to every covenant of the lessor, whether it refers to the subject matter of the lease or not.

    (2) In subsection (1)(b), the reference to every covenant of the lessee is,---

    *   (a) the right to give any notice under the lease; and
    
    *   (b) the right to take advantage of any condition of the lease; and

##### 233 Benefit of lessee's covenants to run with reversion

    *   (a) run with the reversion; and
    
    *   (b) may be exercised by the person who is from time to time entitled to the income of the land, whether or not the lessee has acknowledged that person as lessor (that is, with or without attornment by the lessee).

    Compare: [Grantees of Reversions Act 1540][641], 32 Hen 8, c 34 (Imp); 1952 No 51 [s 112][643]

##### 234 When rights arising from covenants may be exercised
    
*   (1) A person who is entitled under [section 233(1)][269] to exercise a right to which that section applies---
        
    *   (a) may exercise that right even though the basis for doing so first arose or accrued before the time at which that person became so entitled; and
    
    *   (b) is the only person entitled to exercise that right.
    
    (2) Subsection (1)(a) applies unless---

    *   (b) the lessee was released from the obligation to which the right relates.
    
    (3) Subsection (1)(b) applies unless the person who becomes entitled to exercise the right has agreed to the exercise of that right by some other person (in which case the right may be exercised by the other person to the extent so agreed).

    *   (a) the reversion expectant on the lease is divided into different parts, and different persons are entitled to the income of those different parts (that is, a severance of the reversion as regards the land); or
    
    *   (b) the lease has terminated for part only of the land comprised in the lease (that is, a severance of the reversion as regards the estate).
    
    (2) The obligations referred to in [section 231][267] and the rights and remedies to which [section 233][269] applies---
        
    *   (a) must be apportioned; and
    
    *   (b) to the extent required by that apportionment, must remain attached, as the case requires, to---
            
        *   (i) each part of the reversion; or
        
        *   (ii) that part of the land for which the lease has not been terminated; and
        
        
    
    *   (c) may, to that extent, be---
            
        *   (i) enforced by the person entitled to enforce those obligations under [section 231][267]; or
        
        *   (ii) exercised by the person entitled to exercise those rights and remedies under [section 233][269].

##### 236 Notice of termination of lease after severance
    
*   (1) This section applies to a lease if---
        
    *   (a) the reversion expectant on the lease is divided into different parts; and
    
    *   (b) a notice of termination of the lease is given after that division; and
    
    *   (c) the notice terminates the lease for part only of the land comprised in the lease.
    
    (2) The lessee may, within 20 working days after receiving the notice of termination referred to in subsection (1), terminate the lease for the residue of the land comprised in the lease by notice to the person entitled to the reversion of that residue.
    
    (3) A notice given by the lessee under subsection (2) takes effect on the date the notice of termination referred to in subsection (1) takes effect.

##### 237 Effect of payment by lessee to assignor of reversion
    
*   (1) This section applies to a lease if the lessor has transferred or assigned the reversion expectant on the lease.
    
    (2) A lessee who pays all or part of the rent or other amounts due under the lease to the transferor or assignor of that reversion is discharged to the extent of that payment if the lessee had no actual notice of the transfer or assignment.
    
    (3) For the purposes of subsection (2), the registration of a transfer of the reversion is not, in itself, actual notice to the lessee of the transfer, despite anything to the contrary in any other enactment.

##### 238 Effect of acknowledgement by lessee of another person as lessor
    
*   An acknowledgement by a lessee that a person who is not entitled to the reversion expectant on a lease is the lessor has no effect on the person who is so entitled, unless the acknowledgement is made---
        
    *   (a) with the consent of the person who is so entitled; or
    
    *   (b) under a court order.

### Subpart 5---Effect of transfer or assignment of leases

##### 239 Application of subpart
    
*   (1) This subpart applies to a transfer or assignment of a leasehold estate or interest in land that comes into operation on or after 1 January 2008 (whether the lease came into operation before, on, or after that date).
    
    (2) If a transfer or assignment to which this subpart applies relates to part only of the land comprised in a lease, the provisions of this subpart apply only in relation to the part that is transferred or assigned.

##### 240 Transferee or assignee becomes lessee
    
*   (1) A person who accepts a transfer or assignment of a lease becomes the lessee of the land without need to---
        
    *   (a) acknowledge (by attornment or otherwise) the lessor as the lessor of the land; or
    
    *   (b) take possession of the land.
    
    (2) If a lease contains a covenant that the lessee will not, or will not without the lessor's consent, transfer or assign the lease, a transfer or assignment of the lease by the lessee has effect whether or not---
        
    *   (a) the lessor has consented to the transfer or assignment; and
    
    *   (b) the transfer or assignment is in breach of that covenant.
    
    (3) A person who becomes the lessee under this section---
        
    *   (a) must pay to the lessor the rent payable under the lease; and
    
    *   (b) must observe and perform all covenants of the lessee; and
    
    *   (c) may enforce all covenants of the lessor.
    
    (4) Subsection (3) applies whether or not any covenant referred to in that subsection relates to a subject matter that---
        
    *   (a) was not in existence when the covenant was made; or
    
    *   (b) refers to the subject matter of the lease.
    
    (5) Subsection (3) does not apply to a covenant that, immediately before the transfer or assignment, was not binding on the lessee, or on the lessor, as the case requires.
    
    (6) To avoid doubt, subsection (2) does not prevent the lessor from---
        
    *   (a) re-entering the land peaceably (and without committing forcible entry under [section 91][501] of the Crimes Act 1961); or
    
    *   (b) cancelling the lease; or
    
    *   (c) making a claim for a breach of the covenant referred to in that subsection.
    
    

##### 241 Transferor or assignor remains liable
    
*   (1) If there has been a transfer or assignment of a lease, the transferor or assignor remains liable to the lessor for---
        
    *   (a) the payment of the rent payable under the lease; and
    
    *   (b) the observance and performance of all covenants of the lessee.
    
    (2) However, if, without the consent of the transferor or assignor, the transferee or assignee agrees with the lessor to vary the lease, the variation does not increase the liability of the transferor or assignor beyond that provided for by the lease at the time of the transfer or assignment.
    
    (3) Subsection (1) does not apply to a covenant that, immediately before the transfer or assignment, was not binding on the lessee, or on the lessor, as the case requires.
    
    (4) Subsection (2) does not apply if the lease provides for the variation.

##### 242 Covenant implied in transfer or assignment of lease
    
*   (1) Every transfer or assignment of a lease must be taken to contain a covenant by the transferee or assignee with the transferor or assignor that, on and after the date of the transfer or assignment, the transferee or assignee will---
        
    *   (a) pay the rent payable under the lease as and when it falls due; and
    
    *   (b) observe or perform every other covenant of the lessee; and
    
    *   (c) indemnify the following persons against all claims and expenses for the non-payment of the rent or the breach of any other covenant of the lessee:
            
        *   (i) the transferor or assignor and anyone claiming through the transferor or assignor:
        
        *   (ii) any previous transferor or assignor.

    *   (a) the transfer or assignment of the lease by the previous transferor or assignor came into operation before, on, or after 1 January 2008; and
    
    *   (b) the non-payment of rent or the breach of any other covenant of the lessee results from an act or omission of---
            
        *   (i) the transferee or assignee; or
        
        *   (ii) a successor in title of the transferee or assignee.

    *   (d) the refusal to transfer or assign the reversion expectant on a lease.
    
    (3) Any term expressed or implied in a lease or in any other instrument has no effect if it---
        
    *   (a) provides that the lease is automatically cancelled by breach of a covenant or condition of the lease; or
    
    *   (b) is otherwise inconsistent with this section or with [sections 244 to 264][283]; or
    
    *   (c) has the purpose or effect of avoiding the need for compliance with this section or with [sections 244 to 264][283].
    
    Compare: 1952 No 51 [s 118][647]

##### 244 Cancellation of lease for breach of covenant or condition: general
    
*   (1) A lessor who wishes to exercise a right to cancel a lease because of a breach by the lessee of a covenant or condition of the lease may---

    *   (b) re-enter the land peaceably (and without committing forcible entry under [section 91][501] of the Crimes Act 1961).
    
    (2) However, subsection (1) is subject to [sections 245][284] and [246][285].
    
    (3) If the lessor applies to a court for an order for possession of land for the purpose of cancelling a lease, the cancellation takes effect---
        
    *   (a) on the making of the order; or
    
    *   (b) on any later date that is specified in the order.
    
    Compare: Landlord and Tenant Act 1730, 4 Geo 2, c 28 [s 2][648] (UK); 1952 No 51 [s 118][647]

##### 245 Cancellation of lease for breach of covenant to pay rent
    
*   (1) A lessor may exercise a right to cancel a lease because of a breach of the covenant to pay rent under the lease only if---
        
    *   (a) the rent has been in arrears for not less than 10 working days; and
    
    *   (b) the lessor has served on the lessee a notice of intention to cancel the lease; and
    
    *   (c) at the expiry of the period specified in the notice, the breach has not been remedied.
    
    (2) However, if the lessor believes on reasonable grounds that the lessee has given up possession of the leased premises (whether or not the lessee has actually done so), the lessor does not need to serve a notice of intention to cancel the lease on the lessee but must serve the notice instead on all of the following whose names and addresses are known to the lessor:
        
    *   (a) any mortgagee or receiver of the leasehold estate or interest:
    
    *   (b) any sublessee of the lease:
    
    *   (c) any mortgagee or receiver of the estate or interest of a sublessee.

    *   (c) the period within which the breach must be remedied (which must not be less than 10 working days after the date of service of the notice):
    
    *   (d) the consequence that, if the breach is not remedied at the expiry of the period specified in the notice, the lessor may seek to cancel the lease in accordance with [section 244][283]:
    
    *   (e) the right, under [section 253][292], to apply to a court for relief against cancellation of the lease, and the advisability of seeking legal advice on the exercise of that right.
    
    (4) The period for remedying the breach specified under subsection (3)(c) may run concurrently with the period specified in subsection (1)(a) in which the rent must be in arrears before the lessor may exercise any right to cancel the lease.
    
    Compare: Landlord and Tenant Act 1730, 4 Geo 2, c 28 [s 2][648] (UK); 1952 No 51 [s 118][647]

##### 246 Cancellation of lease for breach of other covenants
    
*   (1) A lessor may exercise a right to cancel a lease because of a breach of a covenant or condition of the lease (except the covenant to pay rent) only if---
        
    *   (a) the lessor has served on the lessee a notice of intention to cancel the lease; and
    
    *   (b) at the expiry of a period that is reasonable in the circumstances, the breach has not been remedied.

        *   (i) the thing that the lessee must do or stop doing; or
        
        *   (ii) the amount of compensation that the lessor considers reasonable; and
        
        
    
    *   (c) the consequence that, if the breach is not remedied at the expiry of a period that is reasonable in the circumstances, the lessor may seek to cancel the lease in accordance with [section 244][283]:
    
    *   (d) the effect of [section 247(1) and (2)][286]:
    
    *   (e) the right, under [section 253][292], to apply to a court for relief against cancellation of the lease, and the advisability of seeking legal advice on the exercise of that right.

##### 247 Defects that do not invalidate notice of intention to cancel lease
    
*   (1) The notice required by [section 246(1)(a)][285] is not invalid merely because the lessor---
        
    *   (a) may not have specified that the breach is capable of being remedied by the payment of reasonable compensation; or
    
    *   (b) may have specified an amount of compensation that is unreasonable; or
    
    *   (c) may have specified that the breach would be capable of being remedied by the payment of reasonable compensation, but without specifying the amount that the lessor considers reasonable.
    
    (2) None of the matters set out in subsection (1)(a) to (c) prevents a lessee from offering an amount that the lessee considers to be reasonable compensation for the breach.
    
    (3) For the purposes of this section and [section 246(2)(b)][285], reasonable compensation for the breach may include reimbursement of the lessor's reasonable expenses---
        
    *   (a) in giving the notice required by [section 246(1)(a)][285]; and
    
    *   (b) in doing anything else that the lessor has reasonably done in relation to the breach.
    
    Compare: Landlord and Tenant Act 1730, 4 Geo 2, c 28 [s 2][648] (UK); 1952 No 51 [s 118][647]

##### 248 Application to court for possession of land made before expiry of period of notice of intention to cancel lease
    
*   (1) This section applies to an application made to a court for an order for possession of the land comprised in a lease if---
        
    *   (a) a notice of intention to cancel the lease for breach of a covenant or condition of the lease has been given under [section 246(1)(a)][285]; and
    
    *   (b) the court finds that the application was made before the expiry of the period that was reasonable in the circumstances for remedying the breach.
    
    (2) The court may make the order sought by the application if satisfied that, at the time when the order is made, a period that is reasonable in the circumstances has expired and the breach has not been remedied.
    
    (3) This section overrides [section 246][285].
    
    Compare: Landlord and Tenant Act 1730, 4 Geo 2, c 28 [s 2][648] (UK); 1952 No 51 [s 118][647]

    *   (a) any mortgagee or receiver of the leasehold estate or interest; and
    
    *   (b) any sublessee of the lease; and
    
    *   (c) any mortgagee or receiver of the estate or interest of a sublessee.
    
    (2) The lessor's failure to comply with subsection (1) does not, in itself, prevent the lessor from exercising a right to cancel the lease.
    
    Compare: Landlord and Tenant Act 1730, 4 Geo 2, c 28 [s 2][648] (UK); 1952 No 51 [s 118][647]

##### 250 Acceptance of rent by lessor after notice of intention to cancel lease given not to operate as waiver of lessor's rights
    
*   (1) If a lessor accepts any rent after a notice of intention to cancel the lease is served on the lessee in accordance with [section 245][284] or [246][285] the lessor's acceptance of the rent does not operate as a waiver of the lessor's right, on the ground of a breach of a covenant or condition of the lease, to---
        
    *   (a) apply for an order for possession of the land; or
    
    *   (b) re-enter the land.
    
    (2) Subsection (1) applies unless the lessor, in accepting the rent, causes the lessee reasonably to believe that the lessor no longer intends to exercise the right to apply for an order for possession of, or to re-enter, the land.
    
    Compare: Landlord and Tenant Act 1730, 4 Geo 2, c 28 [s 2][648] (UK); 1952 No 51 [s 118][647]

*   (1) On an application to a court for an order for possession of the land comprised in a lease, the court may make the order and cancel the lease.
    
    (2) If the court makes the order and cancels the lease under subsection (1), it may also do all or any of the following:
        
    *   (a) order the lessee to pay the rent up to the date of cancellation or any later date on which the lessee yields up possession:
    
    *   (b) order the lessee to pay reasonable compensation for the breach:
    
    *   (c) impose on the lessee or the lessor any other conditions that it thinks fit.
    
    (3) For the purposes of this section, reasonable compensation for the breach of a lease may include reimbursement of the lessor's reasonable expenses---
        
    *   (a) in giving notice of intention to cancel the lease under [section 245][284] or [246][285]; and
    
    *   (b) in doing anything else that the lessor has reasonably done in relation to the breach.
    
    Compare: Landlord and Tenant Act 1730, 4 Geo 2, c 28 [s 2][648] (UK); 1952 No 51 [s 118][647]

##### 252 Effect of sections 244 to 251
    
*   (1) [Sections 244 to 251][283] do not prevent a lessor from claiming damages for---
        
    *   (a) the breach of a lease; or
    
    *   (b) the breach of any other duty to the lessor that the lessee may be under independently of the lease.
    
    (2) [Sections 244 to 251][283] also do not affect the amount that the lessor may claim by way of damages.
    
    Compare: Landlord and Tenant Act 1730, 4 Geo 2, c 28 [s 2][648] (UK); 1952 No 51 [s 118][647]

    (2) If an application made in accordance with subsection (1)(d) is not made by all of the joint tenants, the application must be served on every joint tenant who is not already a party, unless the court orders otherwise.
    
    (3) Relief may be sought in---

##### 255 Application for relief not to constitute admission
    
*   (1) This section applies to an application for relief against the cancellation, or proposed cancellation, of a lease.
    
    (2) The application is not, in itself, to be taken as an admission by the person making it---

    *   (b) that, because of the breach, the lessor has the right to cancel the lease; or
    
    *   (c) that a notice has been duly served on the applicant in accordance with [section 245][284] or [246][285]; or

    *   (c) every person entitled who is of full age and capacity---

    *   (d) any person who has an interest in the wrongly placed structure:
    
    *   (e) the relevant territorial authority.
    
    (2) The application may be made whether the wrongly placed structure was placed on or over the land affected---
        
    *   (a) before or after any boundary of that land or of the land intended for the structure was fixed; or

    (4) The granting of relief does not deprive any person of any claim for damages that the person would otherwise have against any other person for any deliberate or negligent act or omission in relation to---
        
    *   (a) the placing of a wrongly placed structure; or

    (2) Subsection (1) does not prevent the court from granting relief merely because the person seeking relief knew of the true boundaries or ownership of the land affected at the time that the structure was placed there, or at the time when that person became the owner of, or acquired an estate or interest in, the land affected, the land intended, or the structure.
