    (3) If the postal operator believes, on reasonable grounds,---

    (4) Where proceedings are taken against any person for the offence in respect of which the postal article was seized, then, when the proceedings are completed or abandoned, the postal operator must cause the postal article to be delivered to the person who appears to the postal operator to be entitled to it, unless, where the court enters a conviction, the postal article is forfeited to the Crown under [section 8][13].
    
    (5) If no such proceedings are taken within 6 months after that seizure, the postal operator must cause the article to be delivered to the person who appears to the postal operator to be entitled to it.
    
    (6) If, in any case to which subsection (4) or subsection (5) applies, the person who appears to the postal operator to be entitled to the postal article cannot be found, or there is no such person, the postal article is forfeited to the postal operator, and the postal operator may destroy or otherwise dispose of it as the postal operator thinks fit.

    (3) On an application made under subsection (1), the District Court Judge may make an order directing that the postal article be delivered to such person as the Judge considers is entitled to it, or that it be destroyed or otherwise disposed of in such manner as the Judge thinks fit.
    
    (4) On an application made under subsection (2), the District Court Judge may do any of the following things:
        
    *   (a) make any order that a Judge may make under subsection (3):
    
    *   (b) adjourn the application, on such terms as the Judge thinks fit,---
            
        *   (i) for proceedings to be brought against any person for the offence in respect of which the postal article was seized; or
        
        *   (ii) if the Judge considers it necessary that the postal article be preserved as evidence in any proceedings:
        
        
    
    *   (c) dismiss the application.
    
    

##### 8 Disposal following conviction
    
*   (1) On the conviction of any person for an offence against this Act involving any postal article seized under [section 6(1)][11], the convicting court, in addition to or instead of passing any other sentence or making any other order in respect of the offence, may order that the postal article is forfeited to the Crown; and in that case the postal article so forfeited must be destroyed or otherwise disposed of as the Minister directs.
    
    (2) Before making an order under subsection (1), the court must give---
        
    *   (a) the person convicted; and
    
    *   (b) any other person who, in the opinion of the court, would be directly affected by the making of the order---
    
    an opportunity to be heard.
    
    (3) If the court is satisfied that the postal article that was the subject of the prosecution should be restored to a person other than the person convicted, it may so direct.
    
    (4) Any person aggrieved by an order made under subsection (1) for the forfeiture of any postal article may (whatever the amount involved) appeal from that order in the manner provided by [subpart 4][112] of Part 6 of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011, and, until the appeal is determined or abandoned, the order is suspended and must not be carried into effect.
