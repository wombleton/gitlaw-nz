#### General provisions

##### 6 Overview of release
    
*   (1) This section is intended to give a broad overview of how and when offenders are released from detention. It does not confer rights or impose obligations and, if there is an inconsistency between this section and any other, the other section prevails.
    
    (2) Unless an offender has been released earlier under this Part, he or she must be released from detention on his or her statutory release date, and after that is no longer subject to recall. However, offenders may be subject to release conditions after their statutory release date.
    
    (3) This subpart provides for 2 types of early release from a prison---
        
    *   (a) parole:
    
    *   (b) compassionate release.
    
    (4) Parole has the following characteristics:
        
    *   (a) it is available only to an offender who is subject to a long-term sentence:
    
    *   (b) it is granted by the Board, which also imposes release conditions:
    
    *   (c) an offender on parole from a determinate sentence is subject to recall at any time until his or her statutory release date:
    
    *   (d) an offender on parole from an indeterminate sentence is subject to recall for life.

##### 7 Guiding principles
    
*   (1) When making decisions about, or in any way relating to, the release of an offender, the paramount consideration for the Board in every case is the safety of the community.
    
    (2) Other principles that must guide the Board's decisions are---
        
    *   (a) that offenders must not be detained any longer than is consistent with the safety of the community, and that they must not be subject to release conditions that are more onerous, or last longer, than is consistent with the safety of the community; and
    
    *   (b) that offenders must, subject to any of [sections 13 to 13AE][17], be provided with information about decisions that concern them, and be advised how they may participate in decision-making that directly concerns them; and
    
    *   (c) that decisions must be made on the basis of all the relevant information that is available to the Board at the time; and
    
    *   (d) that the rights of victims (as defined in [section 4][241] of the Victims' Rights Act 2002) are upheld, and submissions by victims (as so defined) and any restorative justice outcomes are given due weight.
    
    (3) When any person is required under this Part to assess whether an offender poses an _undue risk_, the person must consider both---
        
    *   (a) the likelihood of further offending; and
    
    *   (b) the nature and seriousness of any likely subsequent offending.

    *   (b) may impose any special conditions for a period of up to 6 months from the offender's statutory release date.
    
    (2AA) Despite subsection (2)(a), if the Board imposes any special conditions on the offender that the Board considers incompatible with all or any of the standard release conditions, the Board may suspend the incompatible standard release conditions during the period in which those special conditions are in force, and time runs on the suspended conditions during that period.
    
    (2A) Subsection (2) applies to an offender in respect of whom an extended supervision order is made, in order to ensure that, if the offender is released early under [section 52][77], he or she will be subject to release conditions before the extended supervision order comes into force.
    
    (3) If an offender who is subject to a long-term sentence is, while not on parole or compassionate release, sentenced within the year preceding his or her statutory release date to a short-term sentence whose release date is after that statutory release date, then, if the offender is released at the release date of the short-term sentence, that release date must be treated as if it were the release date of a long-term sentence.

    (2) If subsection (1) applies except that the offender is subject to more than 1 short-term sentence, the offender must be released on the release date of the short-term sentence (including any short-term notional single sentence) that has the latest release date.
    
    (3) To avoid doubt, subsection (2) does not apply in respect of any short-term sentences that are imposed cumulatively if the resulting notional single sentence is a long-term sentence.
    
    (4) If an offender is released in accordance with subsection (1) or subsection (2),---

    *   (b) the actual date of release is determined under [sections 51(2)][76] and [52][77] as if the offender were being released at his or her statutory release date.
    
    (5) If for any reason an offender is released in accordance with subsection (1) or subsection (2) before the Board has imposed release conditions as required by subsection (4)(a), then,---
        
    *   (a) if the offender was, at the start date of the sentence (or earliest applicable sentence), subject to any release conditions, the Board is deemed to have reimposed those release conditions for the remainder of the period for which they were originally imposed; and
    
    *   (b) if the offender was not, at the start date of the sentence (or earliest applicable sentence), subject to release conditions, the offender is not subject to release conditions when he or she is released under subsection (1) or subsection (2).

    (8) For the purpose of determining the parole eligibility date (if any) of sentence B of an offender to whom subsection (7) applies, the full term of sentence A must be treated as the non-parole period of sentence A.

##### 27A Consideration of offenders for parole during epidemic
    
*   (1) This subsection applies to a requirement in any of [sections 21 to 27][35] for the Board to consider an offender for parole that (but for this section) would have the effect of requiring the Board to consider an offender for parole---
        
    *   (a) while an epidemic management notice is in force; or
    
    *   (b) after an epidemic management notice has expired, but while (in the Board's opinion) there remains as an effect of the outbreak of the disease referred to in the notice a backlog of offenders who, by virtue of one of those requirements, should have been considered for parole before the offender.
    
    (2) It is a sufficient compliance with a requirement to which subsection (1) applies if the Board considers the offender concerned for parole as soon after he or she should have been considered as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
    
    (3) The circumstances include---
        
    *   (a) the number of appropriately qualified employees of the chief executive available to produce reports for the Board:

    (4) In deciding the order in which it should consider for parole offenders who, by virtue of subsection (2), may be considered for parole as soon after they should have been considered as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances, the Board---
        
    *   (a) must first consider how much time has passed since each of them should have been considered; but
    
    *   (b) may then consider them for parole in any order it thinks appropriate.
    
    (5) If the notice applies to only stated parts of New Zealand, subsections (1) to (4) apply within those parts only.

##### 28 Direction for release on parole
    
*   (1AA) In deciding whether or not to release an offender on parole, the Board must bear in mind that the offender has no entitlement to be released on parole and, in particular, that neither the offender's eligibility for release on parole nor anything else in this Act or any other enactment confers such an entitlement.
    
    (1) The Board may, after a hearing at which it has considered whether to release an offender on parole, direct that the offender be released on parole.
    
    (2) The Board may give a direction under subsection (1) only if it is satisfied on reasonable grounds that the offender, if released on parole, will not pose an undue risk to the safety of the community or any person or class of persons within the term of the sentence, having regard to---
        
    *   (a) the support and supervision available to the offender following release; and
    
    *   (b) the public interest in the reintegration of the offender into society as a law-abiding citizen.
    
    (3) If the Board directs the release of an offender on parole, it must specify the date on which the offender is to be released, which must be a date that is---
        
    *   (a) not later than 6 months after the hearing; and
    
    *   (b) not a non-release day.
    
    (4) Despite subsection (3)(b), the Board may, in exceptional circumstances, specify a date for release that is a Thursday or a Friday.
    
    (5) The Board may revoke or amend any direction under this section at any time before the offender is released on parole, but, if it does so, the Board must hold another parole hearing as soon as practicable.

#### Cumulative sentences

##### 75 Cumulative sentences form notional single sentence
    
*   (1) If, after the commencement date, an offender is sentenced to a sentence of imprisonment (a _later sentence_) that is directed to be served cumulatively on another sentence (an _earlier sentence_), the later sentence and the earlier sentence form a notional single sentence for the purpose of determining---

    *   (b) the non-parole period to apply when determining the offender's parole eligibility date; and
    
    *   (c) the release date to apply when determining the offender's statutory release date.
    
    (2) If the earlier sentence is part of a series of cumulative sentences, then all the sentences (including any pre-cd sentences) in that series, along with the later sentence, form a notional single sentence for the purpose described in subsection (1).
    
    (3) Every sentence (including any pre-cd sentences) in a series of cumulative sentences links to the next one in the series at its sentence expiry date.
    
    (4) Every notional single sentence is deemed to be a sentence that is imposed on or after the commencement date, even if it contains a pre-cd sentence.

    (2) If a sentence (the **original sentence**) ceases to apply because the conviction to which it relates is quashed and a retrial ordered, and if a sentence of imprisonment is imposed following the retrial, the start date of the later sentence is the start date of the original sentence.
    
    (3) In either situation referred to in subsection (1) or subsection (2), if the original sentence was directed to be served cumulatively on another sentence but the later sentence is not directed to be served cumulatively, then the start date of the later sentence is the start date that the original sentence would have had if it had not been directed to be served cumulatively.

    *   (a) every short-term sentence (being a sentence imposed after the commencement date) within the notional single sentence must be treated as if it had a non-parole period of one-third of its length; and
    
    *   (ab) every sentence in respect of which an order under [section 86C(4)][284] or [86D(3)][285] of the Sentencing Act 2002 has been made must be treated as if the full term of the sentence were the non-parole period of the sentence; and
    
    *   (b) every long-term pre-cd sentence under which the offender is eligible for parole must be treated as if it had a non-parole period of the period represented by the time between the commencement of the sentence and the close of the date on which the offender is eligible to be released on parole from that sentence under [section 89][281] of the Criminal Justice Act 1985; and

    (5) Detention that would, under subsection (2) or subsection (3), be pre-sentence detention, is not pre-sentence detention for the purposes of subsection (1) if the offender was, during that detention,---
        
    *   (a) under legal custody in accordance with the Corrections Act 2004 and serving a sentence of imprisonment; or

##### 92 Procedure for recording length of pre-sentence detention
    
*   (1) The person who is in charge of a prison, social welfare residence, hospital, or secure facility referred to in [section 91(2)][136] (in this section referred to as a _detention place_) must keep a record of---
        
    *   (a) the date on which a person is admitted to the detention place on detention as referred to in [section 91(2)][136]; and
    
    *   (b) the total period during which the person is subsequently detained before sentence in that detention place, whether on the original charge or any other charge.
    
    (2) After sentencing, the person in charge of the detention place (other than a Police jail) must supply the offender with a copy of the record kept under subsection (1) and, if the offender disputes the accuracy of the record, he or she may apply to the person who made it to review it.
    
    (3) A person in charge of a detention place (other than a Police jail) who receives an application under subsection (2) must immediately review the record and, having reviewed it, must notify the offender in writing of---
        
    *   (a) whether the record is confirmed; or
    
    *   (b) the manner in which the record is amended.
    
    (4) If the offender is dissatisfied with the outcome of the review, he or she may appeal the review to the court that imposed the sentence, in which case [subpart 4][404] of Part 6 of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011 applies so far as it is applicable and with any necessary modifications, to the appeal.
    
    (5) An extradition offender or an ICC offender or a MACM offender (as defined in [section 93][138]) may exercise the rights in this section to review and appeal a record of pre-sentence detention (as recorded on their relevant certificates) in the same way as any other offender may seek a review and appeal against a determination of the record of pre-sentence detention.

##### 93 Definition of extradition offender and ICC offender and MACM offender
    
*   (1) An offender is an _extradition offender_ for the purpose of [sections 91][136] and [92][137] if---
        
    *   (a) the offender was convicted following his or her extradition to New Zealand of the offence to which the extradition related, or of any other offence for which he or she could be tried in New Zealand in accordance with [section 64][405] of the Extradition Act 1999 as a result of that extradition; and
    
    *   (b) the offender was detained in custody in the country from where the offender was extradited in relation to the request for extradition; and
    
    *   (c) a certificate under [section 62][398] of the Extradition Act 1999 was obtained showing the total period during which the offender was held in custody in relation to the request for extradition.
    
    (2) An offender is an _ICC offender_ if---
        
    *   (a) [section 98(1)][406] of the International Crimes and International Criminal Court Act 2000 applies to the offender; and
    
    *   (b) a certificate was obtained under [section 99][399] of the International Crimes and International Criminal Court Act 2000 showing the total period during which the offender was held in custody overseas in relation to a request by the ICC before the imposition of sentence in New Zealand.
    
    (3) An offender is a _MACM offender_ if---
        
    *   (a) [section 41A][407] of the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1992 applies to the offender; and
    
    *   (b) a certificate was obtained under [section 41B][400] of the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1992 showing the total period during which the offender was held in custody overseas in relation to a request by a foreign country before the imposition of sentence in New Zealand.

##### 94 Time ceases to run in certain circumstances
    
*   For the purpose of calculating how much time an offender who is subject to a sentence of imprisonment has served, time ceases to run,---
        
    *   (a) for an offender detained in a prison, during any period when the offender is unlawfully at large from detention; and
    
    *   (b) for an offender on parole or compassionate release, during any period between the date on which an application for a recall order is lodged and the date on which the offender is next taken into custody.
    
    *   (c) \[Repealed\]

##### 95 Time on bail pending appeal does not count as time served
    
*   (1) Any time during which an offender is released from detention on bail pending an appeal does not count as time served under any sentence.
    
    (2) To avoid doubt, time spent released from detention on bail is not pre-sentence detention (as defined in [section 91][136]).

##### 96 Period between quashed sentence and new sentence does not count as time served
    
*   (1) Subsection (2) applies if---
        
    *   (a) a sentence of imprisonment is passed on the conviction of an offender; and
    
    *   (b) that conviction is subsequently quashed and a new hearing or a new trial is ordered; and
    
    *   (c) following a new hearing or a new trial, the offender is again convicted and a new sentence of imprisonment is imposed on the offender.
    
    (2) In the situation described in subsection (1), the period commencing on the quashing of the first sentence and the imposition of the new sentence does not count as time served under the new sentence.
    
    (3) However, this section is subject to [section 90][135] (which means that if the offender is remanded in custody during the period described in subsection (2), that period of pre-sentence detention counts as time served under the subsequent sentence).

### Subpart 4---Transitional arrangements for offenders subject to pre-cd sentences

#### General rules

##### 97 Application of this Part to offenders subject to pre-cd sentences
    
*   (1) Every offender who was released under [Part 6][226] of the Criminal Justice Act 1985 before the commencement date is deemed to have been released under [subpart 2][8] of this Part and, in particular,---
        
    *   (a) an offender who was released on parole or at his or her final release date is deemed to be on parole under [section 28][43], and any conditions to which the offender is subject are deemed to be release conditions imposed by the Board; and
    
    *   (b) an offender who was released to home detention is deemed to be on home detention under [section 35][53] (as in force before the commencement of [section 72][401] of the Parole Amendment Act 2007), and any conditions to which the offender is subject are deemed to be detention conditions imposed by the Board; and
    
    *   (c) an offender who was released under a direction by the Minister of Corrections under [section 94][244] of the Criminal Justice Act 1985 is deemed to have been released on compassionate release under [section 41][61], and any conditions to which the offender is subject are deemed to be release conditions imposed by the Board; and
    
    *   (d) an offender who was directed to be released under the [Criminal Justice Act 1985][409] before the commencement date, but who (although the direction had not been revoked) had not in fact been released by that date, must be released under the Criminal Justice Act 1985 in accordance with the direction but, once the offender is released, paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) apply as if the offender had been released before the commencement date.
    
    (2) If, before the commencement date, an offender is referred under [section 97(5) or (6)][289] of the Criminal Justice Act 1985 to the Board for consideration but the Board has not made a decision then, after the commencement date, the offender must be brought to the attention of the chairperson for consideration for referral to the Board under [section 25][39] of this Act.
    
    (3) If, before the commencement date, an offender is being considered by the Minister of Corrections for early release under [section 94][244] of the Criminal Justice Act 1985 but the Minister has not made a decision, then, after the commencement date, the offender must be brought to the attention of the chairperson for consideration for referral to the Board under [section 41][61] of this Act.
    
    (4) If an offender referred to in subsection (3) was being considered by the Minister of Corrections on the ground referred to in [section 94(1)(c)][244] of the Criminal Justice Act 1985, the chairperson may refer the offender, and the Board may release him or her under [section 41][61] of this Act, as if he or she were eligible to be considered under that section.
    
    (5) A properly made application for a recall order that is made under the [Criminal Justice Act 1985][409] before the commencement date must, after the commencement date, be treated as if it were a properly made recall application under [section 60][90] of this Act, and [sections 65][95] and [66][97] apply accordingly.
    
    (6) A properly made interim recall order that is made under the [Criminal Justice Act 1985][409] before the commencement date must, after the commencement date, be treated as if it were a properly made interim recall order made under [section 62][92] of this Act, and [sections 63 to 66][93] apply accordingly.
    
    (7) An application for an order under [section 105][293] of the Criminal Justice Act 1985 must, after the commencement date, be dealt with as if it were an application under [section 107][155] of this Act.
    
    (8) Every order made under [section 105][293] of the Criminal Justice Act 1985 must be reviewed by the Board under [section 107(6)][155] of this Act as if the order had been made under that section.
    
    (9) Despite subsection (1), every appeal against a decision made under [Part 4][225] or [Part 6][226] of the Criminal Justice Act 1985 must, whether the appeal is lodged before or after the commencement date, be lodged and dealt with as if Part 6 of that Act had not been repealed.
    
    Section 97(1)(b): amended, on 1 October 2007, by [section 52][410] of the Parole Amendment Act 2007 (2007 No 28).

##### 98 Transitional provisions for hearings within 3 months after commencement date
    
*   (1) During the transition period (defined in subsection (3)), every hearing by the Board of a type referred to in [section 42][63] (which relates to hearings to decide release conditions at statutory release, parole hearings, and home detention hearings) must be an attended hearing as described in [section 49][71], despite anything in [sections 45 to 48][67].
    
    (2) To avoid doubt, during the transition period the Board may exercise any and all of its powers under [sections 42 to 50][63] with respect to hearings due to be held after the end of the transition period.
    
    (3) In this section and [section 99][146], _transition period_ means the period starting on the commencement date and ending on the date that is 3 months after the commencement date.

##### 99 Chief executive may exercise certain powers before commencement date
    
*   (1) Before the commencement date, the chief executive may, with respect to any hearing by the Board that is due to be held during the transition period (defined in [section 98(3)][145]), take any administrative steps that are necessary or desirable to ensure that, after the commencement date, the Board will be able to conduct the hearings as required by this Act, including---
        
    *   (a) arranging for reports to be provided to the Board as required by [section 43(1)][64]; and
    
    *   (b) giving notice as required by [section 43(2) and (3)][64]; and
    
    *   (c) providing victims who request information (as permitted under [section 44][66]) with that information; and
    
    *   (d) fixing times for attended hearings and giving notice as required by [section 45(7)(b) and (c)][67].
    
    (2) After the commencement date, any power exercised by the chief executive under subsection (1) is deemed to have been exercised by the Board.

##### 100 Offenders subject to non-association orders
    
*   (1) This section applies to an offender who is subject to a pre-cd sentence and to an order made under [section 77B][411] of the Criminal Justice Act 1985 that the offender must not associate with any specified person or with persons of any specified class (a _non-association order_).
    
    (2) When an offender to whom this section applies is released under this Part, he or she is subject to the non-association order imposed by the court in addition to the conditions imposed by the Board as if, for all purposes, the order were a release condition imposed by the Board.
    
    (3) The offender or a probation officer may apply to the Board for the variation or discharge of a non-association order as if the order were a special condition imposed under this Part.

##### 101 Corrective training deemed to be short-term sentence
    
*   For the purposes of this Part, a sentence of corrective training imposed under the [Criminal Justice Act 1985][409] is deemed to be a short-term sentence of imprisonment.

##### 102 Suspended sentences
    
*   (1) This section applies if,---
        
    *   (a) before the commencement date, an order was made under [section 21A(1)][412] of the Criminal Justice Act 1985 suspending a sentence of imprisonment; and
    
    *   (b) after the commencement date, an order is made under [section 21A(4)][412] of that Act (as continued for this purpose by [section 155][413] of the Sentencing Act 2002) bringing the suspended sentence into effect.
    
    (2) For the purposes of sentence calculation, the start date of the suspended sentence is the date on which the order under [section 21A(4)][412] of the Criminal Justice Act 1985 is made, and the sentence is deemed to be a short-term sentence imposed after the commencement date.

#### Release at final release date

##### 103 Purpose and effect of section 104
    
*   (1) The purpose of [section 104][152] is to provide a special form of release for offenders who are subject to long-term pre-cd sentences and whose release would otherwise be delayed as a result of the operation of [subparts 2][8] and [3][112].
    
    (2) By way of explanation, the effect of [section 104][152] is that, if it applies to an offender, the Board is obliged to release the offender on parole at his or her final release date, but the offender is subject to release conditions, and is liable to recall until his or her statutory release date.

##### 104 Release at final release date
    
*   (1) An offender who is detained under a long-term pre-cd sentence must be released from detention on his or her final release date, subject to the provisions of this section.
    
    (2) If the offender's final release date is also his or her statutory release date, the offender must be released under [subpart 2][8], and not under this section.
    
    (3) An offender must not be released under this section if, on his or her final release date,---
        
    *   (a) the offender is also subject to a sentence of imprisonment imposed after the commencement date that has a release date that is later than the offender's statutory release date as it was at the commencement date; or
    
    *   (b) the offender is subject to an order under [section 107][155], or an application for such an order, or an application under [section 105][293] of the Criminal Justice Act 1985\.
    
    (4) If subsection (3) ceases to apply to an offender, the offender must be released under this section on his or her final release date or, if that date has passed, on a date set by the Board that is as soon as practicable after it and that is not a non-release day.
    
    (5) The following sections apply to an offender who is released under this section:
        
    *   (a) [sections 7 to 16][11]:
    
    *   (b) [section 17][30], as if the offender were being released at his or her statutory release date:
    
    *   (c) [sections 29 to 32][44], as if the offender were being released on parole:
    
    *   (d) [sections 42 to 50][63], as if the offender were being considered for release on parole:
    
    *   (e) [sections 51 to 54][76], as if the offender were being released at his or her statutory release date:
    
    *   (f) [sections 56 to 73][84], as if the offender had been released on parole.
    
    (6) A reference in this Act or any other enactment to an offender released on parole includes a reference to an offender released under this section.

##### 105 Calculation of final release dates
    
*   (1) The final release date of an offender who is subject to a pre-cd sentence must be determined under [section 91][283] of the Criminal Justice Act 1985, but any date so determined may be varied in accordance with [section 106][154].
    
    (2) If, after a final release date has been varied in accordance with [section 106][154], it appears that the original date determined under the [Criminal Justice Act 1985][409] should be amended (for instance, because a sentence is quashed, or an error in the determination is discovered), then the original determination may be amended and, if necessary, section 106 applies to the amended determination.
    
    Section 105(1): amended, on 7 July 2004, by [section 30][414] of the Parole (Extended Supervision) Amendment Act 2004 (2004 No 67).

##### 106 Variation and cancellation of final release dates
    
*   (1) If, after the commencement date, an offender who is subject to a long-term pre-cd sentence is sentenced to a new concurrent sentence whose release date falls between the offender's final release date and his or her _original statutory release date_ (being the offender's statutory release date as it was at the commencement date), the offender's final release date becomes the release date of the new sentence; and if the offender becomes subject to more than 1 such new sentence, the final release date becomes the release date of the new sentence that has the latest release date.
    
    (2) If, after the commencement date, an offender who is subject to 1 or more long-term pre-cd sentences is sentenced to a sentence that is directed to be served cumulatively on one of the pre-cd sentences, the offender's final release date---
        
    *   (a) is cancelled if the resulting notional single sentence is a short-term sentence; or
    
    *   (b) if the resulting notional single sentence is a long-term sentence, becomes the date that is calculated by---
            
        *   (i) taking the period between the final release date of the earlier sentence and the expiry date of that sentence; and
        
        *   (ii) deducting that period from the sentence expiry date of the notional single sentence.
        
        
    
    (3) When subsection (2)(b) applies, if the notional single sentence is subsequently revised (by extending or reducing the notional single sentence), the offender's final release date---
        
    *   (a) is cancelled if the revised notional single sentence is a short-term sentence; or
    
    *   (b) must be calculated by deducting the period referred to in subsection (2)(b)(i) from the expiry date of the revised notional single sentence.
    
    (4) Subsection (1) may not be applied if the result would be to extend the offender's final release date to a date that is later than his or her original statutory release date.
    
    (5) None of subsection (1), subsection (2), or subsection (3) may be applied if the result would be to make the offender's final release date earlier than it was before the subsection was applied to it.
    
    (6) The final release date of an offender who is subject to a long-term pre-cd sentence is cancelled, and [section 104(1)][152] therefore ceases to apply, if the offender is recalled under a final recall order from parole, home detention (directed by the Board before the commencement of [section 72][401] of the Parole Amendment Act 2007 or in accordance with that section), or compassionate release.
    
    Section 106(6): added, on 7 July 2004, by [section 31][415] of the Parole (Extended Supervision) Amendment Act 2004 (2004 No 67).
    
    Section 106(6): amended, on 1 October 2007, by [section 53][416] of the Parole Amendment Act 2007 (2007 No 28).

##### 107 Order that offender not be released

##### 107I Sentencing court may make extended supervision order
    
*   (1) The purpose of an extended supervision order is to protect members of the community from those who, following receipt of a determinate sentence, pose a real and ongoing risk of committing sexual offences against children or young persons.
    
    (2) A sentencing court may make an extended supervision order if, following the hearing of an application made under [section 107F][164], the court is satisfied, having considered the matters addressed in the health assessor's report as set out in section 107F(2), that the offender is likely to commit any of the relevant offences referred to in [section 107B(2)][159] on ceasing to be an eligible offender.
    
    (3) To avoid doubt, a sentencing court may make an extended supervision order in relation to an offender who was, at the time the application for the order was made, an eligible offender, even if, by the time the order is made, the offender has ceased to be an eligible offender.
    
    (4) Every extended supervision order must state the term of the order, which may not exceed 10 years.
    
    (5) The term of the order must be the minimum period required for the purposes of the safety of the community in light of---
        
    *   (a) the level of risk posed by the offender; and
    
    *   (b) the seriousness of the harm that might be caused to victims; and

    (6) If the person to whom an application for an extended supervision order relates is already subject to an extended supervision order, any new order may not be made for a period that, when added to the unexpired portion of the earlier order, exceeds 10 years.

    (5) The court may, on the application of the chief executive, or on the application of the offender, cancel or vary a subsisting order under subsection (1) if satisfied that the cancellation or variation needs to be made before the Board determines which (if any) special conditions should be imposed on the offender.
    
    (6) Any variation under subsection (5) has effect as an order under subsection (1).
    
    (7) [Section 107K][173] applies with all necessary modifications to an order under subsection (1).

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Parole Act 2002\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 July 2013, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][511] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][512] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][513] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][514] and [17E][515] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
