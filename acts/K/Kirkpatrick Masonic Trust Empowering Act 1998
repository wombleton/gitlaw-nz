An Act to---
    
*   (a) widen the purposes for which the residuary estate of the late Samuel Kirkpatrick may be applied towards assisting with the education and accommodation of female children who are in need; and

*   (b) confer powers to sell, lease, or let Kirkpatrick House, and to sell or dispose of its furniture and effects; and

*   (c) require the proceeds of any sale of Kirkpatrick House and the proceeds of any sale of the furniture and effects to form part of the residuary estate of the late Samuel Kirkpatrick; and

*   (d) confer power to acquire or erect alternative accommodation for the wider purposes to which the residuary estate may be applied; and

*   (e) consolidate and amend legislation relating to the Kirkpatrick Masonic Institute

*   #### Preamble
    
    Whereas---
    
    A Samuel Kirkpatrick (_the testator_) of Nelson, manufacturer, died on 21 May 1925:
    
    B The Public Trustee is the trustee under the testator's will:
    
    C Under his will ([paragraph 7][19] of which is set out in the Schedule of this Act), the testator---
        
    *   (a) gave his family residence at Nelson and the furniture and other effects in it so as to permit a Board of Governors (_the Board_) to manage it as a Masonic institution or boarding establishment primarily for the boarding and maintenance and (if his residuary estate was sufficient and the Board thought it expedient) education of female orphans of certain Freemasons; and
    
    *   (b) provided for the income from his residuary estate to be applied by the Board for the purposes of carrying on the institution:
    
    D The institution was opened on 4 April 1926 and became known as the Kirkpatrick Masonic Institute, but is now known as Kirkpatrick House:
    
    E The Kirkpatrick Masonic Institute Empowering Act 1930 enabled the Board to accept and use gifts for the purposes of the Institute, and to distribute money to the orphans for certain purposes:
    
    F The Kirkpatrick Masonic Institute Empowering Amendment Act 1983 enabled the Board, among other things, to---
        
    *   (a) provide for the boarding and maintenance at Kirkpatrick House of the daughters of Freemasons of good standing in their Lodges or of any other female children nominated for admission by a Lodge or other Masonic body, who are in a position of need because of the death, illness, or misfortune of either or both parents; and
    
    *   (b) if the residuary estate is sufficient and the Board thinks it expedient, pay for the education of any of those children while resident in Kirkpatrick House and pay for their further education and advancement in life after leaving Kirkpatrick House,---
    
    but with preference being given to female children who qualify under [paragraph 7][19] of the testator's will:
    
    G The Board has advised the Public Trustee that because it has become uneconomic and inappropriate to manage Kirkpatrick House for the original purposes, the Public Trustee should have the power to sell, lease, or let Kirkpatrick House and apply the proceeds to the wider purposes specified in paragraph H. The Board has also advised the Public Trustee that the Public Trustee should have the power to acquire or erect alternative accommodation:
    
    H The Board has also advised the Public Trustee that the trusts created by the will (as extended and varied by legislation) would be of greater public benefit if they were widened to permit the Board to use the income from the residuary estate to---
        
    *   (a) assist in paying for the education, at any level, of any female children who have been nominated by a Lodge or other Masonic body and who are in need because of the death, illness, or misfortune of either or both parents; and
    
    *   (b) provide accommodation for, or assist in paying for the accommodation of, those female children while they are being educated (whether or not they are receiving assistance from the Board with the cost of their education),---
    
    but with preference being given to children of deceased Freemasons:
    
    I The Public Trustee agrees that it is desirable to widen the trusts in the manner proposed by the Board:
    
    J The objects of this Act can be attained only by legislation.

    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that have yet to come into force or that contain relevant transitional or savings provisions are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order.

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][25] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][26] and [17E][27] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
