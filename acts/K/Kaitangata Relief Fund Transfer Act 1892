An Act for the Transfer of the Kaitangata Relief Fund into the Public Trust Office, and its Conversion into a Mining Accident Fund.
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    WHEREAS on the seventeenth day of February, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-nine, an explosion occurred in the Kaitangata coal-mine, whereby thirty-four miners lost their lives, and, by a public subscription throughout the colony and some of the adjacent colonies in Australia, a large fund was collected for the benefit of the widows and children of the miners who were so killed: And whereas but few of the said widows and children remain to receive relief from the said fund, and after providing for these a large surplus remains year by year in the hands of the Trustees of such fund, which is from time to time invested in various securities, there being a sum at present invested as aforesaid amounting to nineteen thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars entirely unavailable for any purposes of need which may arise: And whereas the Trustees of the said fund at the present time are---
    
    The Mayor of the City of Dunedin, _ex officio_;
    
    George Turnbull, of Dunedin, gentleman;
    
    James Taylor Mackerras, of Dunedin, merchant;
    
    John Bryce Thomson, of Dunedin, builder; and
    
    William Matthew Hodgkins, of Dunedin, solicitor;
    
    and the bankers of the Trustees are the Colonial Bank of New Zealand: And whereas it is expedient to render the aforesaid surplus of the fund, after providing for the present beneficiaries, available for the relief of wives and children of coal-miners who may be killed by mining accidents occurring in any part of the colony; and for such purpose to transfer such surplus into the Public Trust Office as a nucleus of a permanent Coal-mining Accident Fund:
    
    The reference to ""nineteen thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars"" was substituted, as from 10 July 1967, for a reference to ""nine thousand eight hundred and seventy-five pounds"" pursuant to section [7(1)][11] of the Decimal Currency Act 1964 (1964 No 27).
