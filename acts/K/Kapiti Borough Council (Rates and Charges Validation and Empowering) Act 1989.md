An Act---
    
*   (a) to validate certain rates and charges and other rating arrangements purportedly made by the Kapiti Borough Council; and

*   (b) to empower the Kapiti Borough Council to prepare and implement an urban farm-land roll

*   #### Preamble
    
    Whereas---
        
    *   ###### Lump sum contributions
    
    *   (1) At a meeting held on 18 February 1987 the Council resolved to adopt the recommendations contained in a report of a meeting of the Financial Review Committee of the Council held on 28 January 1987, and thereby approved a scheme to allow ratepayers to make contributions towards the repayment of certain water and sewerage loans (hereinafter referred to as **the lump sum contribution scheme**); and
    
    *   (2) Certain details of the lump sum contribution scheme were circulated to certain ratepayers of the Borough of Kapiti by memorandum in April 1987 and April 1988; and
    
    *   (3) Purportedly in reliance on the lump sum contribution scheme, certain payments have been made to the Council, which payments have been or are to be applied by it in repayment of principal of certain water and sewerage loans; and
    
    *   (4) The lump sum contribution scheme and the manner in which it was implemented are not authorised under the [Local Government Act 1974][12] or under any other enactment; and
    
    *   (5) It is desirable that all payments made and all money received and applied by the Council under the lump sum contribution scheme be validated, and that special provision be made for the continuation of the scheme; and
    
    *   ###### 1987--1988 rates
    
    *   (6) At a meeting held on 18 March 1987 the Council resolved to make and levy the rates, charges, discounts, and additional charges specified in the resolution for the year ending with 31 March 1988; and
    
    *   (7) Certain of those rates and charges, namely, the uniform annual charges in respect of the Paraparaumu water supply, the Paraparaumu sewerage system, and the coastal protection loan repayments, were not authorised by any enactment in force at the time the rates and charges were made; and
    
    *   (8) The resolution of 18 March 1987 purported to allow a discount on the total rates for the 1987--1988 year of 5%, 4%, or 3% upon payment of the total rates in full on or before 30 April 1987, 30 June 1987, or 28 August 1987 respectively; and
    
    *   (9) The dates before which payment was required to be made to qualify for discount were before the due dates for certain of the instalments and therefore the discounts were not authorised by section 70 of the Rating Act 1967; and
    
    *   (10) In reliance upon the resolution of 18 March 1987, the Council has made, levied, and collected some of the uniform annual charges and has allowed the discounts; and
    
    *   (11) It is desirable that the uniform annual charges made, levied, and collected and the discounts allowed by the Council for the year ending with 31 March 1988 be validated; and
    
    *   ###### 1988--1989 rates
    
    *   (12) At a meeting held on 17 February 1988 the Council resolved to give public notice of its intention to make and levy rates, charges, discounts, and additional charges specified in the resolution for the year ending with 31 March 1989; and
    
    *   (13) Public notice of the Council's intention to make and levy the rates and charges was given in the _Kapiti Observer_ on 14 March 1988; and
    
    *   (14) At its meeting on 23 March 1988 the Council resolved to make and levy the rates and charges; and
    
    *   (15) The resolutions and the public notice were purportedly made under the authority of, amongst other Acts, the Rating Powers Act 1987 and include references to provisions in the Rating Powers Act 1987; and
    
    *   (16) All references in the resolution and in the public notice to the Rating Powers Act 1987 and to provisions in the Rating Powers Act 1987 should be to the Rating Act 1967 and to provisions in the Rating Act 1967 respectively; and
    
    *   (17) Certain charges, discounts, and additional charges were not authorised by any enactment in force at the time they were made, namely, the uniform annual charges in respect of the Paraparaumu water supply, the Paraparaumu sewerage system, Paraparaumu stormwater, and for coastal protection loan repayments, the discount on rates, and the additional charge on rates; and
    
    *   (18) All the rates and charges not authorised under existing legislation are not lawfully made and all other rates and charges may not have been lawfully made; and
    
    *   (19) It is desirable that the rating resolutions, the rates assessments issued in reliance on the resolutions, and the rates and charges made, levied, and collected by the Council for the year ending on 31 March 1989 be validated; and
    
    *   ###### 1989--1990 instalments
    
    *   (20) Since the close of the year ending with 31 March 1989, the Council has levied instalments of rates under the authority of section 153 of the Rating Powers Act 1988, assessed by reference to the last instalment levied in respect of each property in the 1988--1989 year; and
    
    *   (21) The rates on which such instalments were based at the time the instalments were levied, and the assessments by which the instalments were levied, did not comply in all respects with the requirements of the Rating Powers Act 1988; and
    
    *   (22) It is desirable that the levying and collection of the amounts specified in those assessments be validated; and
    
    *   ###### Coastal protection loan repayment charges
    
    *   (23) The Council undertook the construction of continuous lengths of protective seawall at Raumati South and at Paekakariki after a severe storm in September 1976 caused major damage to beach front properties; and
    
    *   (24) Before construction work commenced the Council obtained from Raumati South property owners with beach frontages to be protected by the seawall, undertakings to contribute to the costs of construction; and
    
    *   (25) When construction of the seawall was completed, the Council reached agreement with a committee representing Raumati South beach front property owners, on various matters including---
            
        *   (a) the total cost of construction to be recovered, adjusted to take account of subsidies received from the National Water and Soil Conservation Authority:
        
        *   (b) the total cost expressed as a dollar value per metre of seawall constructed, to be paid in respect of each property protected by the seawall in proportion to the number of metres of beach frontage of that property:
        
        *   (c) that payment could be made either in total before 31 March 1980 at the rate of $100.06 per metre of frontage or by annual payment at the rate of $13.39 per metre of frontage per year for 15 years:
        
        *   (d) that property owners making the annual payment could at any time within the 15 years repay the balance of the costs outstanding in respect of their property as at the time of repayment; and
        
        
    
    *   (26) Initially property owners received invoices from the Council for the amounts owing in terms of the agreement and elections made under the agreement, but, at the request of property owners, the Council decided to include the amounts owing on rates assessments for the year ending with 31 March 1982 and for subsequent years; and
    
    *   (27) In the Council rates resolution for the year ending with 31 March 1982 and in each year's rates resolutions since, provision has been made for the annual payment under the heading coastal protection loan repayment charge at the rate of $13.39 (since 1986--1987 adjusted to take account of goods and services tax) per metre of property frontage protected on every property within the Raumati coastal protection special rating area, except for those properties where the liability in respect of the protection afforded by the seawall had been met, and assessments of the coastal protection charge have been included on rates assessments; and
    
    *   (28) The making, levying, and collection of the coastal protection charge as a rate is not authorised under the Rating Act 1967 or any other legislation; and
    
    *   (29) It is desirable that the making, levying, and collection of the coastal protection charge and any discount or additional charges in respect of the coastal protection charge be validated and that alternative provision be made for its collection in future; and
    
    *   ###### Urban farm-land roll
    
    *   (30) The Council was required, pursuant to section 134 of the Rating Act 1967, to make a new farm-land roll for the Borough of Kapiti to come into force on 1 April 1988, when a new valuation roll for the urban district of the Borough came into force; and
    
    *   (31) The Council had not made a new farm-land roll as at 29 June 1988 when Part 10 of the Rating Powers Act 1988 came into force; and
    
    *   (32) Had a farm-land roll been in force at the commencement of the Rating Powers Act 1988 it would have continued in force in terms of section 169 of that Act; and
    
    *   (33) There is doubt whether, with the commencement of the Rating Powers Act 1988, the Council now has authority to make a farm-land roll; and
    
    *   (34) The Council has received requests from ratepayers for a farm-land roll and desires to make and implement such a roll.

    (2) Any farm-land roll prepared under the authority of subsection (1) shall be deemed for all purposes to have come into force on 1 April 1988, and the provisions of section 169 of the Rating Powers Act 1988 shall apply as if the roll was in force at the commencement of that Act.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Kapiti Borough Council (Rates and Charges Validation and Empowering) Act 1989\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 28 November 1989, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][14] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][15] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][16] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][17] and [17E][18] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
