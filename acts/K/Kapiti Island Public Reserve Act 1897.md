*   #### Preamble
    
    WHEREAS the Island of Kapiti, situated in the Land District of Wellington, containing four thousand nine hundred and ninety acres, more or less, is owned principally by Maori who are not in beneficial use or occupation of the same: And whereas, for the purposes of conserving the natural scenery of the said island, and providing a preserve for the fauna and flora of New Zealand, it is desirable that the said island should be acquired by Her Majesty as a public reserve, and that pending such acquisition all dealings therewith by private persons should be prohibited and determined:
    
    The reference to ""Maori"" was substituted, as from 27 November 1947, for a reference to ""Native"" pursuant to section [2(2)][9] Maori Purposes Act 1947 (1947 No 59).

BE IT THEREFORE ENACTED by the General Assembly of New Zealand in Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

    Section 2 was amended, as from 1 April 1987, by section [65(1)][10] Conservation Act 1987 by substituting the words ""the Minister of Conservation"" for the words ""a Minister of the Crown"".

##### 3 Certain estates and interests in said island to vest in Her Majesty, subject to provisions of this Act
    
*   All estates and interests, whether freehold or lesser estate, in any lands forming part of the said island, held or acquired by any person or persons other than the original Maori owners, or their heirs or successors according to Maori custom, shall upon the passing of this Act vest in Her Majesty upon and subject to such terms as to compensation and otherwise as by this Act are provided.
    
    The reference to ""Maori"" was substituted, as from 27 November 1947, for a reference to ""Native"" pursuant to section [2(2)][9] Maori Purposes Act 1947 (1947 No 59).

##### 4 Provision for payment of compensation to owners or lessees
    
*   Failing any agreement being made as to compensation to be paid, every person deprived of any freehold or any lesser valid estate or interest by the operation of this Act shall be entitled to compensation therefor, to be ascertained and determined under the provisions of the Public Works Act 1981,as in the case of Maori lands or other lands, as the case may be, taken for a public work.
    
    The reference to ""Maori"" was substituted, as from 27 November 1947, for a reference to ""Native"" pursuant to section [2(2)][9] Maori Purposes Act 1947 (1947 No 59).
