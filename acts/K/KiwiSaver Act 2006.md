## Part 2  
Membership of overall KiwiSaver scheme

### Subpart 1---Becoming members of overall KiwiSaver scheme

##### 9 Outline of how people become members of overall KiwiSaver scheme
    
*   (1) This subpart provides for employees and other persons to become members of the overall KiwiSaver scheme by---
        
    *   (a) the operation of the automatic enrolment rules when an employee starts new employment, with the effect that a person becomes subject to automatic deductions from his or her salary or wages, but may opt out within specified time limits; or
    
    *   (b) opting in (whether as an employee who becomes liable for automatic deduction of contributions from his or her salary or wages or otherwise).
    
    (2) This subpart also provides for employers to be exempt employers, with the effect that the automatic enrolment rules will not apply to their employees when they start new employment.

#### Automatic enrolment rules

##### 10 Who automatic enrolment rules apply to
    
*   The automatic enrolment rules apply to every employee who is not a secondee and---
        
    *   (a) starts new employment with an employer that is not an exempt employer; and
    
    *   (b) is aged 18 or over, but less than the New Zealand superannuation qualification age, when he or she starts that new employment.
    
    Section 10: amended, on 19 December 2007, by [section 31][416] of the Taxation (KiwiSaver) Act 2007 (2007 No 110).

##### 11 Meaning of new employment and secondee
    
*   (1) _New employment_ means any employment that is started on or after the date of commencement of the automatic enrolment rules, but---
        
    *   (a) does not include temporary employment (except as provided in [section 12][16]); and
    
    *   (b) does not include employment in respect of which the employee remains on the same payroll as the payroll that he or she was on immediately before starting that employment; and
    
    *   (c) does not include employment with an employer that carries on the same business as the business in which the employee was employed immediately before starting the employment; and
    
    *   (d) does not include employment, at the end of a secondment, by the employer from which a secondee was seconded.
    
    (2) _Same business_ means a business that, in substance, carries on the same or a similar role (regardless of whether or not the legal entity carrying on the business changes), and includes, without limitation,---
        
    *   (a) a company that results from, or continues after, an amalgamation under the [Companies Act 1993][385] involving the company by which the employee was employed immediately before that employee started the employment; and
    
    *   (b) a business that takes over as a going concern the business in which the employee was employed immediately before that employee started the employment.
    
    (2B) _Secondee_ means an employee seconded from an employer to the employment of another employer (_employer B_), in respect of which the employee is on employer B's payroll.
    
    (3) However, subsection (1)(c) applies only if an employer has given to the Commissioner the notice (if any) that is required by the Commissioner for the purposes of the administration of this section.

    ###### Example
    
    Company A provides access to a superannuation scheme for its employees. The trust deed provides that employees, if they decide to become members, must contribute at either 1% or 3% of annual gross base salary. The employer is obliged to match the employee's contributions (eg, if employee contributes 1%, company must contribute 1%).
    
    The scheme complies with the rule as to the 4% minimum contribution as follows:
    
    Minimum amount employee member must contribute
    
    1%
    
    Maximum amount that employer must contribute in respect of employee member
    
    3%
    
    4%

    (6) The FMA may publish, in any form that the FMA thinks fit, guidance on matters that the FMA considers relevant under this section (including principles that the FMA may use to decide whether to approve a transfer).

    *   (b) if A makes a voluntary payment into the KiwiSaver scheme, the payment must, for the purposes of [section 6][684] of the Financial Transactions Reporting Act 1996, unless the provider has already verified A's identity, be treated as a request to a financial institution for the person to become a facility holder within the meaning of that Act.
    
    (4) In this section, _voluntary payment_ means,---
        
    *   (a) in relation to a member of a KiwiSaver scheme who has become a member of that scheme under [section 48][61] or [52][66], a payment made by or for the benefit of that person into the KiwiSaver scheme that is not a deduction from salary or wages made under [subpart 1][84] of Part 3; and
    
    *   (b) in relation to a member of a KiwiSaver scheme to whom paragraph (a) does not apply, a payment made by or for the benefit of that person into the KiwiSaver scheme that is in excess of the amount the member is contractually bound to pay into the scheme within a defined period.

    (2) The Minister of Finance may make a recommendation under subsection (1) only if the Minister is satisfied that any mortgage diversion facility provided for in regulations will be consistent with the following principles:
        
    *   (a) there is no compulsion on providers to provide a mortgage diversion facility:
    
    *   (b) there is no compulsion on mortgagees to allow amounts secured by mortgages to be paid via KiwiSaver and complying superannuation fund contributions:
    
    *   (c) the mortgage diversion facility is available in relation to a person at any time after 12 months have expired since the earlier of---
            
        *   (i) the date that the Commissioner received the first contribution in respect of the person; or
        
        *   (ii) the date that the relevant KiwiSaver scheme provider or complying superannuation fund provider received the first contribution in respect of that person's membership to the relevant scheme or fund:
        
        
    
    *   (d) the mortgage diversion is available only in relation to a mortgage over the person's principal residence (for example, the family home):
    
    *   (e) the mortgage diversion may apply for the remainder of the term of the mortgage after the diversion is made available, but only to the extent to which the mortgage continues to be over the person's principal residence:
    
    *   (f) after the total amount secured by the mortgage is paid, ongoing contributions are not diverted from the person's KiwiSaver scheme and complying superannuation funds:
    
    *   (g) if the person chooses to cease the mortgage diversion facility before the amounts secured by the mortgage are fully paid, the contributions are redirected towards retirement savings:
    
    *   (h) the provider, and not the Commissioner, is responsible for paying the amount diverted under the mortgage diversion facility:
    
    *   (i) the amount diverted from a person's KiwiSaver scheme and complying superannuation funds is capped at not more than the total of---
            
        *   (i) half of the total contributions deducted for or contributed by the person, received by their KiwiSaver scheme provider; and
        
        *   (ii) half of the person's contributions to their complying superannuation funds, but limited to 4% of their annual gross base salary or wages for each complying superannuation fund:
        
        
    
    *   (ia) an amount may not be diverted if it was received by the relevant provider before the provider has received from the person a request to divert amounts under the mortgage diversion facility:
    
    *   (j) employer contributions may not be diverted:
    
    *   (jb) an amount that was transferred from an Australian complying superannuation scheme may not be diverted:

    (3) The regulations may specify all or any of the terms and conditions that apply to the mortgage diversion facility, including---
        
    *   (a) which types of mortgages qualify for participation in the diversion facility; and
    
    *   (b) what a scheme must do to participate in the mortgage diversion facility (for example, in relation to notification); and
    
    *   (c) how the regulations affect the trust deed (for example, whether all or any of the terms and conditions in the regulations are implied terms of the trust deed); and
    
    *   (d) what happens if the scheme decides to terminate participation in the mortgage diversion facility; and
    
    *   (e) whether payment via the mortgage diversion facility counts as payment by the mortgagor for the purpose of the terms of the mortgage; and
    
    *   (eb) closing the mortgage diversion facility to new participants by specifying a date before which a member of a KiwiSaver scheme or complying superannuation fund must request his or her mortgagee to participate in the facility in respect of the member's mortgage; and
    
    *   (f) any other matters.
    
    (4) If a provider chooses to participate in the mortgage diversion facility, any withdrawal made in accordance with those regulations must be treated as if it were a withdrawal that is permitted under the [KiwiSaver scheme rules][360].
