In such case the following provisions shall apply:---
            
        *   (i) If the River Board and such local authority or ratepayer cannot agree as to the price to be paid for such protection works, machinery, or assets, which price shall be such part of the sum actually paid by such local authority or ratepayer for such protection works, machinery, or assets as represents the value to the River Board thereof as part of its undertaking, the dispute shall be referred to the determination and award of two arbitrators and their umpire, pursuant to and so as to have all the incidents and consequences of an arbitration under The [Arbitration Act 1996][38].
        
        *   (ii) In case such purchase is made from a local authority the River Board, in lieu of paying for such protection works, machinery, or assets, may either take over and assume, as substitute for such local authority, the liability for a proportionate part or the whole, as the case may be, of the special loan out of which the protection works, machinery, or assets were paid for by such local authority, but subject always to the consent of the lender; or may issue debentures to such local authority on the same terms as to redemption and rate of interest as such local authority has contracted for in respect of such special loan; and any such local authority is hereby authorized to accept any such debentures in payment for such protection works, machinery, or assets.
        
        *   (iii) In case such purchase is made from a ratepayer the River Board, in lieu of paying for such protection works, machinery, or assets, may issue debentures to such ratepayer for such period, on such terms, and at such rate of interest as the River Board and such ratepayer shall agree.

    *   (f) It may, where it considers it expedient for the satisfactory carrying-out of its operations either on land owned, held, or occupied by it, or, subject to the consent of the owner, on any other land, plant or sow such trees, shrubs, or grasses, or otherwise take such steps as it may think desirable to check or prevent sand-drifts and minimize the damage resulting therefrom, or to carry out any other of its authorized objects whatsoever.
    
    *   (g) No person shall do anything to destroy or damage any such trees, shrubs, grasses, or other works referred to in paragraph [(f)][4] hereof, or any fences or other protection in connection therewith, or any trees, shrubs, _Phormium tenax_, or grasses referred to in section [15][15] of this Act.

*   Without in any way restricting the powers of the River Board to make and levy rates, it is hereby empowered to make and levy the following rates to provide for the payment of administrative or general charges and expenses:---
        
    *   (a) Before any rate has been made and levied consequent upon any classification of the lands or any part thereof within the district made as hereinafter provided: A uniform administrative or general rate or rates over the whole of the lands included within the river district, or over such part or parts of the district as the River Board may decide, whether any such part is a legal subdivision or is known by a distinctive name or not.

        *   (i) A uniform administrative or general rate or rates over all the lands or any part or parts thereof which for the time being are liable or have at any time been liable for or subject to the payment of any special rate or rates consequent upon any classification or classifications then subsisting made by the River Board; and for this purpose the whole of any property the subject of a separate assessment on the valuation roll may if a portion only thereof is classified under any classification then subsisting be liable for or subject to the payment of any such administrative or general rate as if the whole of such property had been so classified; or
        
        *   (ii) In respect of the lands the subject of any one classification made by the River Board and then subsisting, a graduated administrative or general rate or rates over all the said lands or any part or parts thereof which for the time being are liable or have at any time been liable for or subject to the payment of any special rate consequent upon such classification, and each such graduated rate shall be in accordance with that classification. The Board may at the same or any time separately exercise the powers in this paragraph conferred in respect of lands the subject of other classifications (whether the same lands wholly or in part or not) made by it and then subsisting; and if any land or part thereof is subject to more than one such classification, then that land shall not be exempt from payment or liability in respect of any such graduated rate or rates merely because it is so subject.
        
        
    
    

##### 23 Separate rates
    
*   (1) A separate rate or rates may be made and levied within any separate rating-area hereafter created within the district either in lieu of or in addition to any maintenance or administrative rates, and so that the separate rates to be levied in one such rating-area may vary from those in other such areas.
    
    (2) Before directing such separate rate to be made the River Board shall cause an estimate to be prepared of the proposed expenditure of such rate, the period for which the rate is to be made, showing any sums already available for such purpose, the additional sum required, the rateable property within the area affected, and the rate thereon necessary to raise the money required; and such estimate, being approved by the River Board, shall, for at least fourteen days before the River Board directs the proposed rate to be made, be left at its office, or at some other place in the district to be publicly notified, and be open for inspection of all ratepayers.
    
    (3) For the purposes of this section the River Board may at any time and from time to time by special order constitute any part or parts of the district to be a separate rating-area, and the boundaries thereof shall be defined in the special order.
    
    (4) The River Board may at any time and from time to time by special order abolish any such separate rating area or areas, and may, if it see fit, constitute another or others in lieu thereof.
    
    (5) Any such separate rate may be either a uniform or a graduated rate over all the rateable lands within the separate rating-area; provided that if the rate be a graduated rate, then the lands within the separate rating-area shall, before such rate is made and levied, be classified or shall have previously been classified in accordance with the provisions of section [24][24] of this Act, and such graduated rate shall be in accordance with the classification.

    (3) No entry shall be made on any classification list prepared in pursuance of the provisions of this section in respect of any property the subject of a separate assessment on the valuation roll if no portion thereof is classified as having received or being likely to receive any increase in value or any benefit, direct or indirect, from the said works or operations.
    
    (4) It shall not be necessary that any part of the district in which part the lands may be classified as aforesaid shall be a legal subdivision of the district or shall be known by a distinctive name.

    (3) Every classification list, when signed by the River Board in case there is no appeal, and when signed by the District Court Judge after any appeal, shall, for the purpose of any proceedings for the recovery of rates payable under this Act, be conclusive evidence of the liability of the owner or occupier for the time being of the property described therein, and every such list shall remain in force until another is made by direction of the River Board to replace the same.
