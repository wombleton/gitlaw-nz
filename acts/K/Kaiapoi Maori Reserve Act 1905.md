    WHEREAS by Crown grant dated the sixth day of November, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-five, the lands described in Schedule [1][7] hereto were granted to the Bishop of Christchurch and his successors in trust for a Maori industrial school for aboriginal Maoris of New Zealand in connection with the Church of England: And whereas by The Kaiapoi Maori Industrial School Grant Act 1870, it was provided that the Bishop of Christchurch might surrender the said lands to Her Majesty free and discharged of all trusts; and that if the said lands should be so surrendered the Governor might cause a Crown grant to a portion of the said land not exceeding sixteen acres to be made to the said Bishop and his successors in trust for a site for a church in connection with the branch of the Church of England in New Zealand, and for the benefit of those aboriginal Maoris for whose benefit the said recited grant was made, and as and for a site for a school, and a house for the use of the clergyman appointed to perform services in the said church, and for glebe land to be used and occupied with such house; and that the residue of the said lands should be vested in two or more trustees, to be nominated by the Governor under section eight of The Maori Schools Act 1867, as a site for a Maori school: And whereas no surrender has ever been made by the Bishop of Christchurch in terms of The Kaiapoi Maori Industrial School Grant Act 1870: And whereas by Proclamation made in exercise of the powers vested in the Governor by The Maori Schools Act 1867, and published in the _Gazette_ on the sixth day of January, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-one, Henry James Tancred and the Reverend James West Stack were nominated and appointed to be trustees of the land described in Schedule [1][7] hereto: And whereas the said Proclamation was _ultra vires_ as to a parcel of land not exceeding sixteen acres, portion of the lands described in Schedule [1][7] hereto, and being the whole of the lands described in Schedule [2][8] hereto: And whereas The Kaiapoi Maori Industrial School Grant Act 1870, has since been repealed by The Repeals Act 1878: And whereas the Bishop of Christchurch for the time being is desirous that for the sake of convenience the lands set out and described in Schedule [2][8] hereto shall be vested in the Church Property Trustees instead of being vested in the Bishop of Christchurch and his successors, and it is expedient to give effect to such desire:
