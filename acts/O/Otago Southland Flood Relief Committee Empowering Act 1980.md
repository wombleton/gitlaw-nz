An Act to discharge the trustees from their administration of certain moneys held in trust for the charitable purpose of providing relief or assistance to persons suffering loss or damage from floods occurring in Otago and Southland in October 1978, and to appoint trustees to administer the unexpended balance of the fund for the relief of those persons and in particular for those who have suffered subsequent loss or damage by recurring flooding, and to provide reimbursement for the loss of services by the Gore Borough Council of its town clerk
    
*   Whereas extensive flooding occurred in Otago and Southland in October 1978: And whereas the Government appointed a committee to administer funds provided for the relief of persons suffering loss or damage as a result of that flooding, which committee comprised the mayor of Gore as its chairman, the mayors of Balclutha, Alexandra, and Mataura, the chairmen of the Southland County, Clutha County, and Tuapeka County, and the county clerk of the Bruce County as members, and the town clerk of the Borough of Gore as secretary of the committee: And whereas subscriptions to that fund were made by organisations and individuals throughout New Zealand, a portion of which fund was subsidised by the Government: And whereas payments have been made from the fund since that time for the relief of persons suffering loss or damage in or as a result of that flooding: And whereas the accounts for the fund have been audited and the approval of the Controller and Auditor-General to the handling of the fund and the making of payments to date has been given: And whereas there is an unexpended balance remaining in the fund: And whereas the township known as Kelso and its surrounding district suffered severe flood damage in October 1978 and subsequently: And whereas those persons whose property has been subjected to recurring floods have suffered additional distress and it is inexpedient that the trustees should seek to isolate distress meriting payment from the fund only to that relating to the October 1978 floods: And whereas there are few remaining claims from the 1978 floods to be met and the trustees have sought to disburse the balance of the funds between those claims and the relief of persons who have suffered recurrence of flooding subsequent to October 1978: And whereas it is desired for this purpose to release the trustees from administration of the remainder of the fund and to vest its administration in the persons hereinafter named, and to make provision for the reimbursement for the Gore Borough Council of the time and expenses of its town clerk directly attributable to his work in the administration of the unexpended balance of the fund.

For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][12] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][13] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.

For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][14] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][15] and [17E][16] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
