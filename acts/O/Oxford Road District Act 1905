*   The Oxford Road Board, in respect of the main drain of the Cust, shall have all the powers and authorities conferred upon Drainage Boards by sections seventeen to twenty-four of The Land Drainage Act 1904, in the same manner and to the same extent as if the Board had been constituted a Drainage Board under that Act.

##### 5 Validation of construction of main drain
    
*   (1) The diversion of the water of the River Cust into the main drain of the Cust as heretofore made in or about the year one thousand eight hundred and eighty, or previously thereto, and the construction of such drain as heretofore constructed and as it exists at the time of the passing of this Act, shall, as and from the passing thereof, be deemed to have been lawfully made and constructed; and the Oxford County Council may, for the purposes of this Act, continue to divert and take water from such river, and, if necessary, may return the same to such river at any point or points within or without the Oxford Road District.
    
    (2) The Oxford Road Board, with the previous consent of the local bodies having control of the lands affected, may make any drains, outlets for water, or other works, under the powers of this Act, through or on any lands outside the Oxford Road District for the purpose of connecting the main drain of the Cust with the River Cust outside such district.

##### 6 Main drain deemed a public work
