    WHEREAS all that parcel of land being Section 14, Block XLVII, Town of Oamaru, containing by admeasurement one rood, more or less, was granted by the Crown to the Superintendent of the late Province of Otago by a Crown grant dated the third day of May, eighteen hundred and sixty-nine: And whereas by virtue of The Oamaru Town Reserves Management Act 1869, the said parcel of land was vested in the Corporation of the Incorporated Town of Oamaru and its successors (now the Corporation of the Mayor, Councillors, and Burgesses of the Borough of Oamaru), in trust for purposes of public utility for the Town to Oamaru and its inhabitants: And whereas Albert Joseph Grave, of the said Town of Oamaru, solicitor, is the owner in fee-simple of Sections 7, 8, and 9, Block L, Town of Oamaru, containing by admeasurement three roods, more or less: And whereas, with a view of obtaining a convenient access to an adjoining borough reserve, the Corporation of the Mayor, Councillors, and Burgesses of the Borough of Oamaru has agreed with the said Albert Joseph Grave to transfer to him the said Section 14, Block XLVII, Town of Oamaru, in exchange for the said Sections 7, 8, and 9, said Block L, but legal difficulties have arisen which prevent the carrying-out of the said exchange: And whereas the management of Sections 6, 7, 8, and 9, Block XXV, Town of Oamaru, containing one acre and twenty-one poles, more or less, was by The [Oamaru Town Reserves Management Ordinance 1872][8], vested in the Corporation of the Incorporated Town of Oamaru for the purposes of a market: And whereas by The [Oamaru Market Reserves Act 1878][9], certain limited leasing-power was given to the Corporation of Oamaru in respect to the said sections: And whereas the said land is not required for the purpose of a market: And whereas it is expedient that the said exchange between the Corporation of the Mayor, Councillors, and Burgesses of the Borough of Oamaru and the said Albert Joseph Grave be carried into effect, and it is also expedient that further and extended leasing and management powers be conferred upon the said Corporation of the Borough of Oamaru with respect to said Sections 6, 7, 8, and 9, Block XXV, Town of Oamaru:
