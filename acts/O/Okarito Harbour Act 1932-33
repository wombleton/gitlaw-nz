##### 1 Short Title
    
*   This Act may be cited as the Okarito Harbour Act 1932-33\.

##### 2 Special provisions with respect to control and management of Okarito Harbour
    
*   (1) The Governor-General may from time to time, by Order in Council, vest the control and management of the harbour of Okarito in any person or persons (whether corporate or unincorporate) for a period to be specified in the Order, not exceeding in any case twenty-five years.
    
    (2) The Governor-General may from time to time, by the same or any subsequent Order in Council, direct that any provisions of the Harbours Act 1923, specified in the Order shall apply as if such person or persons were a Harbour Board within the meaning of that Act, and so long as the control and management of the said harbour remains vested in such person or persons all such provisions shall, with the necessary modifications, apply accordingly.
    
    (3) Subject to the last preceding subsection, the provisions of the Harbours Act 1923, shall continue to apply to the said harbour as in the case of harbours where there is no Harbour Board.
    
    (4) Every Order in Council under this Act shall be issued upon such terms and conditions as the Governor-General in Council thinks fit; and any such Order may be from time to time altered or be at any time revoked by a subsequent Order in Council.

##### 3 Provision for making rules in lieu of by-laws
    
*   (1) In the application of any provisions of the Harbours Act 1923, to the harbour of Okarito, all references therein to by-laws made under that Act shall be construed as referring to rules made under this Act.
    
    (2) Rules so made shall not be repugnant to the provisions of the Harbours Act 1923, or any general harbour regulations thereunder, or of this Act or any Order in Council thereunder, or of any other Act; and they shall not come into force until such date as the Minister of Marine specifies in that behalf in a notice published in the _Gazette_ approving such rules, after a copy of the rules signed by the person or persons having the control and management of the said harbour under this Act, or in the case of a company sealed with its common seal, has been sent to the Minister.
    
    (3) Subject to the provisions of this section, the Minister's approval of any such rules may be given upon such terms and conditions as he thinks fit.
    
    (4) The production of any document purporting to be a printed copy of any rule made under this Act and of a notice by the Minister approving such rule, and to be signed by the person or persons having the control and management of the said harbour under this Act, or in the case of a company sealed with its common seal, shall, unless the contrary is shown, be sufficient evidence that such rule has been duly made and approved, and that it duly came into force on the day specified in that behalf in such notice.
