An Act to provide for the Merger of the Otago Dock Trust in the Otago Harbour Board.
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    WHEREAS by the [Otago Dock Act 1883][31], certain pieces of land with the dock and buildings theretofore constructed and erected thereon were vested in the Otago Harbour Board (hereinafter referred to as the Harbour Board), to be held by them as a site and endowment for a graving-dock; and by the said Act it was provided that the Harbour Board should, as soon as conveniently might be after the passing of that Act, construct on a site to be chosen by them on the said land a graving-dock of sufficient dimensions at least to admit vessels drawing twenty-five feet of water; and in order to raise money for the contruction of the said dock it was provided that it should be lawful for the Harbour Board, and they were thereby authorised to raise and borrow from time to time in addition to all other moneys theretofore borrowed and raised or authorised to be borrowed and raised by the Harbour Board a sum or sums of money not exceeding in the whole two hundred thousand dollars. And whereas by the [Otago Dock Act 1883][31], and Amendment Act 1885, the Otago Dock Trust (hereinafter referred to as the Dock Trust) was constituted a body politic and corporate, and all the powers and authorities granted or conferred by the [Otago Dock Act 1883][31], to or upon the Harbour Board in relation to the construction of a graving-dock and of borrowing money for the purpose in manner as in that Act mentioned were transferred to and vested in the Dock Trust with full powers to exercise the same subject to the [Otago Dock Act 1883][31]; and all lands or endowments granted to or vested in the Harbour Board under that Act or under any other Act or enactment for the purpose of such dock were vested in the Dock Trust and their successors for the same purpose: And whereas by the Otago Dock Act Amendment Act 1895, additional powers were conferred on the Dock Trust, including a power for the purposes therein mentioned to borrow from time to time, in addition to all other moneys borrowed or raised or authorised to be borrowed or raised by the Dock Trust, a sum or sums of money not exceeding in the whole twenty thousand dollars: And whereas under the powers contained in the last-mentioned Act the Dock Trust raised two loans of eleven thousand dollars and nine thousand dollars respectively, of which the loan of nine thousand dollars has been paid off: And whereas the said loan of eleven thousand dollars remains outstanding upon the security of fifty-five debentures of two hundred dollars each, payable on the first day of October, nineteen hundred and twenty-eight, bearing interest in the meantime at the rate of four dollars fifty cents per centum per annum, and secured on the dock and other subjects therein mentioned: And whereas by section three of the Port Chalmers Corporation Empowering Act 1903, it was enacted that the Corporation of the Mayor, Councillors, and Burgesses of the Borough of Port Chalmers (hereinafter referred to as the Corporation of Port Chalmers) might contribute every year a sum not to exceed two thousand dollars, to be applied towards payment of the interest on any loan which might be raised by the Dock Trust for the purpose of constructing a graving-dock at Port Chalmers, provided that before any payment should be made under the now-reciting section and before the Council should enter into any agreement, bond, guarantee, or other contract under section four of the now reciting Act, a poll of the ratepayers of the Borough of Port Chalmers should be taken on the proposal to contribute in terms of the now-reciting section: And whereas the Dock Trust proposing for the purpose of constructing a graving-dock at Port Chalmers to raise a loan of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars by the issue of seven hundred and fifty debentures of two hundred dollars each, redeemable on the thirtieth day of June, nineteen hundred and twenty-five, and bearing interest at the rate of five dollars per centum per annum, payable half-yearly on the thirty-first day of December and the thirtieth day of June in each year, and desiring the assistance of the guarantee authorised by the Port Chalmers Corporation Empowering Act 1903, and the Corporation of Port Chalmers proposing to contribute every year out of the district fund of the said borough a sum not exceeding two thousand dollars per annum to be applied towards payment of the interest on such loan, a poll of the ratepayers of the said borough was duly taken as required by the last-mentioned Act of the proposal to so contribute, and such proposal was duly carried at the said poll, and by a deed dated the seventeenth day of July, nineteen hundred and five, made between the Corporation of Port Chalmers of the one part and the Dock Trust of the other part, of which a copy is contained in Schedule [1][24] hereto, the Corporation of Port Chalmers covenanted to make such contribution not exceeding the sum of two thousand dollars in any one year for a period of twenty years as is therein mentioned in the event and subject to the conditions and provisions contained in the said deed: And whereas the Harbour Board having been empowered in that behalf by the Otago Harbour Board Empowering Act 1903, did by a deed dated the twenty-first day of June, nineteen hundred and four, and made between the Harbour Board of the one part and the Dock Trust of the other part, covenant with the Dock Trust that the Harbour Board would every year for a period of thirty years pay to the Dock Trust or its assigns the sum of one thousand dollars as a contribution towards interest on any loan that might be raised by the Dock Trust for the purpose of constructing a graving-dock at Port Chalmers: And whereas by virtue of the Otago Harbour Board Empowering Act 1903 Amendment Act 1905, the Dock Trust released the Harbour Board from the covenant contained in the last-mentioned deed, and by a deed dated the second day of August, nineteen hundred and five, and made between the Harbour Board of the one part and the Dock Trust of the other part, the Harbour Board covenanted with the Dock Trust that the Harbour Board would every year for a period of twenty years pay to the Dock Trust or its assigns the sum of two thousand dollars as a contribution towards the interest on any loan that had been or might be raised by the Dock Trust for the purpose of constructing a graving-dock at Port Chalmers: And whereas by a deed dated the seventeenth day of July, nineteen hundred and five, and made between the Union Steamship Company of New Zealand (Limited), hereinafter called the Union Company, of the one part and the Dock Trust of the other part, of which a copy is contained in Schedule [2][25] hereto, the Union Company bound itself in manner and subject to the provisions therein contained to contribute to the Dock Trust for the period of twenty years therein mentioned a sum of money to be applied towards payment of the interest on the said loan of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars, but so that such contribution of the Union Company for any one year should not exceed the sum of two thousand dollars: And whereas the Dock Trust having agreed to establish a sinking fund of one dollar per centum on the amount of the said loan for the repayment of the said debentures did appoint the Trustees, Executors, and Agency Company of New Zealand (Limited) and James Mills to be Commissioners of the said sinking fund, and by a deed dated the seventeenth day of July, nineteen hundred and five, and made between the Dock Trust of the one part and the said Commissioners of the other part, covenanted with the said Commissioners, their successors and assigns, that the Dock Trust would every year for a period of twenty years reckoned from the thirtieth day of June, nineteen hundred and five, pay to the company and James Mills aforesaid or other the Commissioners or Commissioner for the time being acting under the now-reciting deed the sum of one thousand five hundred dollars as a sinking fund for the repayment of the said loan of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars, by half-yearly payments of seven hundred and fifty dollars on the thirtieth day of June and the thirty-first day of December in each year, and for the payment to such Commissioners or Commissioner of such sums for their services and of their expenditure and for insurance against fire and other matters as in the now-reciting deed mentioned: And whereas the Dock Trust raised the said loan of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars by the issue of seven hundred and fifty debentures of two hundred dollars each, payable on the thirtieth day of June, nineteen hundred and twenty-five, and bearing interest at five dollars per centum per annum payable half-yearly on the thirty-first day of December and the thirtieth day of June in every year until repayment: And whereas the construction of the said graving-dock is now proceeding: And whereas by the Otago Dock Validation Act 1906, it was declared that the said graving-dock did comply and should for all purposes be deemed to comply with the provisions of section [four][32] of the [Otago Dock Act 1883][31], and that the said section should be construed and given effect to accordingly: And whereas negotiations are proceeding between the Dock Trust and the Harbour Board for the merger of the Dock Trust in the Harbour Board, and it is desirable that statutory provision should be made for the event of such negotiations resulting in agreement:

##### (5)
    
*   As long as the liability of the Corporation continues under this deed the Trust shall allow the Corporation or any officer or accountant appointed by it to inspect and take extracts from all books and records of the Trust showing the revenue and expenses of the Trust and all necessary vouchers and papers, and the Trust shall at all times exercise every reasonable economy in carrying out its functions.

##### (3)
    
*   If in any year, after deducting the annual expenses of the Trust from the annual revenue of the Trust, the balance is insufficient to pay the interest on the said loan of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars or thereabouts intended to be raised by the Trust for the purpose of constructing the said dock at Port Chalmers, the Company will pay to the Trust or its assigns a sum equal to one-half of the amount of such insufficiency, but so that the contribution of the Company for any one year shall not exceed the sum of two thousand dollars.

##### (5)
    
*   For the purpose of ascertaining the amount of each contribution interest shall be computed on the moneys for the time being borrowed as aforesaid for a period of one year ending on the day prior to that on which such contribution is appointed to be made, and the annual revenue and expenses of the Trust shall be computed for the same period.

    *   (a) The annual working-expenses of and incidental to all the Trust's operations, and the maintenance and renewal of all machinery and plant, and the upkeep of the docks and appurtenances, and such contingent expenses as may be lawfully chargeable against annual revenue:
    
    *   (b) Any annual payments for the purpose of creating a sinking fund for redemption of the moneys borrowed as aforesaid:
    
    *   (c) The interest on any balance of the freezing-works loan for the time being unpaid:
    
    *   (d) All charges and interest to be or become payable by the Trust upon any bank overdraft or to any banking company or corporation or to any lender of money.
