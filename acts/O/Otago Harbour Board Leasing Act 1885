An Act to provide for the Leasing of the Lands vested in the Otago Harbour Board.
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    WHEREAS it is desirable that the provisions under which the Otago Harbour Board has power to lease the lands vested in it, should be consolidated, and that the form of lease to be used by the Board in leasing its lands should be defined by statute:

BE IT THEREFORE ENACTED by the General Assembly of New Zealand in Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:---

##### 1 Short Title
    
*   The Short Title of this Act is The Otago Harbour Board Leasing Act 1885\.

##### 2 Interpretation
    
*   The following words and expressions shall wherever used throughout this Act have the meanings hereby assigned to each respectively:---
    
    _Board_ means the Otago Harbour Board
    
    _Vessel_ shall have the same meaning as is assigned to it in the eighth section of The Harbours Act 1878\.

##### 3 Board may lease lands
    
*   The Board may lease any lands vested in it or any part thereof for any term not exceeding twenty-one years in possession without any fine, premium, or foregift, with power to grant renewals from time to time for a similar period, or provide for payment of valuation as appears in the form in the Schedule hereto:
    
    Provided that every lease to be granted by the Board shall, except in cases contemplated by the ninth section hereof, be in the form or to the effect set forth in the said Schedule:
    
    Provided also that the lease of all such lands shall, except in cases provided for in the next section, be sold by public auction and at least twenty-one days' notice of such intended sale shall be given by advertising the same in each issue till the day of sale of a daily newspaper circulating in the City of Dunedin.

##### 4 Mode in which land may be dealt with after having been offered at auction and not sold
    
*   Any land which has once been offered for sale by auction as aforesaid, and not sold, may at any time within twelve months thereafter be sold by private contract at a rent not less than the reserved rent when it was so offered; or it may, at any time either before or after the expiration of twelve months, be again offered by public auction, subject as hereinbefore provided, or it may be offered for sale by public tender as the Board think fit.

##### 5 Board may let lands on annual tenancy
    
*   Notwithstanding anything hereinbefore contained to the contrary, it shall be lawful for the Board to let any of its lands by public auction or public tender for a tenancy determinable after the expiration of one year by three months' notice in writing on either side, and in cases contemplated by this section it shall not be necessary for the Board to issue any lease.

##### 6 Board may accept surrenders conditionally
    
*   It shall be lawful for the Board, on such terms as it may think fit, to accept surrenders of any now existing leases:
    
    Provided that the lessees shall accept a new lease or leases, in accordance with the provisions contained in this Act, of the land the lease or leases whereof shall have been so surrendered:
    
    Provided also that the rent to be payable under such new lease shall be fixed by two arbitrators or their umpire, to be appointed pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of The Supreme Court Practice and Procedure Amendment Act 1866:
    
    Provided also that the rent to be payable under any such new lease as aforesaid shall in no case be less than that payable under the previous lease.
    
    The third proviso was inserted, as from 17 August 1886, by section 6 Otago Harbour Board Leasing Act 1885 Amendment Act 1886 (1886 No 12(L)).

##### 7 Board may grant leases to sub-lessees
    
*   The Board may, with the consent of any lessee, his executors, administrators, or assigns, grant to a sublessee a lease direct from the Board of the whole or any part of the land comprised in any such lease, for the whole residue of the term created by the original lease:
    
    Provided that the rent payable to the Board is not lessened, or the term for which the original lease was granted extended thereby.
    
    The provisions of this section shall apply although no lease shall have been actually executed, but only an agreement for a lease entered into.

##### 8 Foreshore may be used and occupied for certain purposes
    
*   The Board may from time to time, subject to the provisions of the one hundred and fifty-sixth section of The Harbours Act 1878, license and permit any part of the foreshore vested in it to be used or occupied for all or any of the following purposes:---
    
    (1) The building or repairing of vessels of any kind.
    
    (2) The erection and use of any boat-shed, landing-place, or wharf.
    
    (3) The erection of baths and bathhouses, and any enclosure or fence necessary for the protection and privacy of the same.
    
    (4) Any other purpose relating to the convenience of shipping, or the public, or for any local enterprise or object of which the Governor in Council may approve.

##### 9 Subject to certain conditions, Board may lease foreshore for fifty years
    
*   The Board may, with the consent of the Governor in Council, but without obtaining any special Act, lease for any period not exceeding fifty years any piece of land vested in it, being on the shore of the sea, or of any creek, bay, or arm of the sea, or navigable river communicating with the sea, and so that such lease may extend as far as low-water mark:
    
    Provided always that no lease shall be made or assented to by the Governor in Council if the Marine Engineer for the time being shall report that the granting of the same will in any way impede or disturb navigation in the harbour:
    
    Provided also that at least twenty-one days' notice of the intention to apply for such consent of the Governor in Council shall be given by advertising the same till the day of application in each issue of a daily newspaper circulating in the City of Dunedin.

##### 10 Repeal
    
*   All provisions respecting leasing contained in The Harbours Act 1878, The Harbours Act 1878 Amendment Act 1883, and The [Otago Harbour Board Act 1883][13], in so far as they affect the Otago Harbour Board, are hereby repealed, and it is hereby declared that the powers of the Board in respect to the leasing of the lands vested in it are contained in this Act.
