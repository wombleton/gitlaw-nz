An Act to amend the Otago Harbour Board Empowering Act 1926 and the Otago Harbour Board Empowering Act 1929 and to vest further powers in the Otago Harbour Board
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    Whereas by the [Otago Harbour Board Empowering Act 1926][16] (hereinafter called the _principal Act_), the Otago Harbour Board (hereinafter called the _Harbour Board_) was authorised to borrow any sums of money not exceeding in the whole 350,000 pounds, and it was provided that the moneys borrowed under the authority of the said Act should be applied for the general improvement of Otago Harbour in carrying out the works specified in the [Schedule][17] of the said Act:
    
    And whereas the objects upon which the said loan moneys were to be expended were partly altered by the [Otago Harbour Board Empowering Act 1929][18] (hereinafter called the _amendment Act_):
    
    And whereas the Harbour Board has reclaimed from the sea a part of its endowment including the area in the vicinity of the mouth of the Water of Leith, all as shown in the plan deposited in the office of the Marine Department at Wellington as Number MD 7041; and in connection with and for the purpose of such reclamation has constructed a channel or canal for the purpose of disposing of the waters of the Water of Leith (which channel or canal is hereinafter referred to as the _said canal_):
    
    And whereas it is deemed expedient for the purpose of providing additional flood protection to increase the capacity of the said canal partly by increasing its size, partly by a new and additional channel or canal, and partly by other works:
    
    And whereas for the purposes of the said new and additional channel or canal it is necessary to occupy and use part of the area occupied by a street alongside the said canal and called Laurel Bank:
    
    And whereas, for the purpose of replacing in part the said street, part of the proposed works consists of the acquisition and laying off and construction as a public street in manner hereinafter mentioned of the land described in the [Schedule][15], which land is vested in the Harbour Board, and is under lease from the Harbour Board to certain lessees:
    
    And whereas it is considered by the Harbour Board that the provision of such additional flood protection is more urgent than some of the objects mentioned in the principal Act and the amendment Act:
    
    And whereas it has been found that the actual cost of acquiring or completing respectively some of the said objects is or will be greater than the estimated cost:
    
    And whereas of the total amount authorised to be borrowed by the principal Act 3 several issues have been made amounting to 100,000 pounds, 125,000 pounds, and 25,000 pounds respectively:
    
    And whereas part of the said issues was made at a discount, which discount and the brokerage paid in connection therewith amount together to the sum of 7,156 pounds:
    
    And whereas it is deemed expedient to empower the Harbour Board to apply 10,000 pounds, part of the loan authorised to be borrowed as aforesaid, towards the cost of such additional flood protection and the works in connection therewith, and to make such consequential alterations in the principal Act and the amendment Act as are hereinafter specified:
    
    And whereas it is also deemed expedient to increase the amount authorised to be expended on certain of the objects specified in the principal Act and the amendment Act, and to reduce the amount authorised to be expended on certain others of those objects in manner hereinafter appearing:
    
    And whereas all those lands comprising Sections numbered Fifteen (15), Sixteen (16), and Seventeen (17), Block Seventy-three (LXXIII), on the plan deposited in the Lands Registry Office at Dunedin as Number 2086, and being part of the land included in certificate of title, Volume 177, folio 97, Otago Lands Registry, are vested in the Harbour Board, subject to the provisions of the Otago Harbour Board Empowering Act 1875:
    
    And whereas the said lands or part thereof are or may be required by the Dunedin Drainage and Sewerage Board (hereinafter called the _Drainage Board_) in connection with the operations of that Board:
    
    And whereas certain loans raised by the Harbour Board become due and payable in 1934:
    
    And whereas debentures issued by the Harbour Board in respect of loans maturing in 1934 are payable either in London or New Zealand at the option of the holders and for various reasons, but principally owing to the present high rate of exchange, it is desirable that the said Board should have power to purchase debentures issued in respect of such loans respectively:
    
    And whereas doubts have been raised as to whether the Board has such power.

##### 1 Short Title
    
*   This Act may be cited as the Otago Harbour Board Empowering Act 1932--33\.

    (2) The Harbour Board shall to the satisfaction of the local authority (being the Corporation of the City of Dunedin) construct the said area of land as a public street in so far as shall be necessary to place the same with regard to metalling, kerbing, and channelling in as good a state as that part of the existing street which it replaces, and the Harbour Board shall also alter the footpath, kerbing, and channelling of the other part of the said existing street in so far as shall be necessary to accord with the decreased width of the street, with all necessary metalling.
    
    (3) When and so soon as the works mentioned in subsection (2) shall be completed the said area of land shall be and become a public street within the meaning of the Municipal Corporations Act 1920, and the Harbour Board shall produce to the District Land Registrar at Dunedin a certificate signed by the Chairman of that Board and the Mayor of the City of Dunedin to the effect that the said works have been completed and that the said land has become a public street.

    *   (d) In the case of the lease of any portion of the said area of land upon and after the vesting in the Harbour Board of the leasehold interest therein the lease of the land of which the same forms a part shall be read and construed and take effect in all respects as if the land remaining subject thereto had been the only land originally demised thereby but subject to the reduction of rent effected by any such memorandum as aforesaid.

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][21] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][23] and [17E][24] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice.

    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
