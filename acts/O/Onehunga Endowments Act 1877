*   #### Preamble
    
    WHEREAS the town endowments of Onehunga are of small extent, and at present yield but little revenue, and whereas a Borough Council, consisting of a Mayor, Councillors, and Burgesses, has been recently established in that town, charged with the Municipal Government thereof, and it is desirable that it should be assisted in the performance of its functions by receiving endowments, and with that view that the lands specified in the [Schedules][8] to this Act annexed should be granted to the Borough Council for the specific purposes hereinafter expressed:

BE IT THEREFORE ENACTED by the General Assembly of New Zealand in Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:---

##### 1 Short Title
    
*   The Short Title of this Act shall be The Onehunga Endowments Act 1877\.

##### 2 Lands in Schedule [1][8] vested in Borough Council of Onehunga
    
*   The lands described in Schedule [1][8], consisting of two acres three roods and thirty perches, granted to the Superintendent of the Province of Auckland as a reserve for a market or pilot-boathouse, shall hereafter vest in the Borough Council of Onehunga, with power to lease, by public auction, with an upset price, the whole or such portions thereof as may not be required for the immediate purposes of a markethouse or pilot-boathouse.

##### 3 Lands in Schedule [2][9] vested in Borough Council for water purposes
    
*   The lands described in Schedule [2][9], consisting of two acres granted to the Board of Education of the Province of Auckland as an educational reserve, may, any law to the contrary notwithstanding, be surrendered by the said Board to the said Borough Council, upon the Board being satisfied either that such allotments were reserved from sale on account of their contiguity to the public springs of the borough, or on being satisfied that the public interests require that these allotments should be constituted a municipal reserve for water purposes, whereupon the grant of the allotments to the Board of Education shall be cancelled, and a new grant of the said allotments shall be made to the said borough as a reserve for water purposes.

##### 4 Reserve in Schedule [3][10] deemed to be Crown land, subject to Public Domains Acts

##### 5 Land in Schedule [4][11] kept as public reserves
    
*   The allotments of land described in Schedule [4][11], consisting respectively of two acres two roods and thirty-six perches, and three roods and twenty-nine perches, shall be kept as public reserves, subject to a road being laid off through the said allotments by the Crown Lands Commissioner for facilitating traffic to the railway station and wharf from the northern side of the Town of Onehunga.

##### 6 Leasing shall be subject to Municipal Corporations Act 1876
    
*   All powers of leasing given under this Act, or The [Onehunga Reserves Act 1875][13], shall be subject to the terms and conditions prescribed with regard to leasing Corporation properties by The Municipal Corporations Act 1876: Provided that no leasing that may have taken place under The [Onehunga Reserves Act 1875][13], shall be affected by the provisions of this Act.
