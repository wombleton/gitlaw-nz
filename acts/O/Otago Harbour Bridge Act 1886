    The Preamble was repealed, as from 19 November 1907, by section [2][21] Statutes Repeal Act 1907 (1907 No 40).

BE IT THEREFORE ENACTED by the General Assembly of New Zealand in Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:---

##### 1 Short Title
    
*   The Short Title of this Act is The Otago Harbour Bridge Act 1886\.

##### 2 Interpretation
    
*   In the interpretation of this Act the following expressions shall, unless the context shall require otherwise, have the meanings annexed thereto:---
    
    _The road district_ shall mean **The Portobello Road District** as constituted by The Portobello Road Board Enabling Act 1882
    
    _The Board_ shall mean the Portobello Road Board
    
    _The county_ shall mean the Peninsula County.

##### 3 Bridge across Otago Harbour may be constructed
    
*   It shall be lawful for the Portobello Road Board to construct and maintain a bridge (hereinafter called **the said bridge**), extending from the City of Dunedin across the Otago Harbour to a point or points in the Peninsula County, if the approvals hereinafter mentioned are first obtained.

##### 4 Plans and specifications to be prepared
    
*   Before proceeding to commence the said bridge the Board shall cause to be prepared a map or maps and plan or plans showing as nearly as may be where it is intended that the same shall be built or constructed, and especially the intending starting-points thereof both in the Peninsula County and in or near the City of Dunedin, and also the nature of the intended structure, together with a specification briefly describing the nature and character of the proposed work and the material thereof: Provided that the said maps, plans, and specifications may refer the one to the other or others, and shall be sufficient if they together contain the aforesaid particulars: Provided further that in such plan the structure shall be so designed that one or more drawbridges shall be constructed to enable shipping to pass through the bridge.

##### 5 And deposited
    
*   The said map or maps, and plan or plans, and specification shall, before they may be approved in manner hereinafter authorized, lie in the office at Dunedin of the Otago Harbour Board for the space of three weeks, and once at least during each of the said three weeks a notice shall be inserted by the Board in two daily newspapers published in Dunedin, stating that the same have been so lodged and are open for inspection.

##### 6 And be approved by the Harbour Board and Dunedin City Council
    
*   Thereafter, if the Otago Harbour Board and the City Council of Dunedin shall approve of the said map or maps, and plan or plans, and specification, they shall note their approval thereon, and shall deliver to the Board a certificate that they have approved of the same, and such certificate shall be conclusive evidence of such approval, and that the provisions of section [four][5] hereof have been complied with.
    
    After the said map or maps, plan or plans, and specification shall have been so approved, they shall be submitted for the approval of the Governor in Council, as provided by The Harbours Act 1878, and upon such approval having been obtained, the Board shall be entitled to commence and proceed with the said work.

##### 7 Borrowing powers
    
*   It shall be lawful for the Board, and it is hereby authorized, to raise and borrow from time to time, for the purposes of the said bridge and of matters connected with the construction and maintenance thereof, such sum or sums as shall be by it deemed to be necessary therefor, not exceeding in the whole the sum of sixty thousand dollars: Provided that no greater rate of interest than six per centum per annum shall be paid upon any such sum so borrowed.
    
    The reference to ""sixty thousand dollars"" was substituted, as from 10 July 1967, for a reference to ""thirty thousand pounds"" pursuant to section [7(1)][22] Decimal Currency Act 1964 (1964 No 27).

##### 8 Bridge in whom vested
    
*   The said bridge and every part thereof shall from time to time as the same is constructed become part of the Peninsula County and of the Portobello Road District, and the same shall, subject to the rights of the other local bodies, be vested in, and be under the control of, the Portobello Road Board.
