#### What are overseas investments in sensitive New Zealand assets

##### 12 What are overseas investments in sensitive land
    
*   An _overseas investment in sensitive land_ is the acquisition by an overseas person, or an associate of an overseas person, of---
        
    *   (a) an interest in land if---
            
        *   (i) the land is sensitive under [Part 1][119] of Schedule 1; and
        
        *   (ii) the interest acquired is a freehold estate or a lease, or any other interest, for a term of 3 years or more (including rights of renewal, whether of the grantor or grantee), and is not an exempted interest; or
        
        
    
    *   (b) rights or interests in securities of a person (_A_) if A owns or controls (directly or indirectly) an interest in land described in paragraph (a) and, as a result of the acquisition,---
            
        *   (i) the overseas person or the associate (either alone or together with its associates) has a 25% or more ownership or control interest in A; or
        
        *   (ii) the overseas person or the associate (either alone or together with its associates) has an increase in an existing 25% or more ownership or control interest in A; or
        
        *   (iii) A becomes an overseas person.
        
        
    
    

##### 13 What are overseas investments in significant business assets

    *   (a) the acquisition by an overseas person, or an associate of an overseas person, of rights or interests in securities of a person (_A_) if---
            
        *   (i) as a result of the acquisition, the overseas person or the associate (either alone or together with its associates) has a 25% or more ownership or control interest in A or an increase in an existing 25% or more ownership or control interest in A; and
        
        *   (ii) the value of the securities or consideration provided, or the value of the assets of A or A and its 25% or more subsidiaries, exceeds $100 million; or

    (2) However, an overseas person that was lawfully carrying on business in New Zealand on 15 January 1996 (which was when the Overseas Investment Regulations 1995 came into force) does not require consent for an overseas investment in significant business assets described in subsection (1)(b) if the investment requires consent only because it comes within that paragraph.

#### Criteria for consent

##### 14 Approach to criteria for consent
    
*   (1) The relevant Minister or Ministers, in considering whether or not to grant consent to an overseas investment transaction,---

    *   (b) may consult with any other person or persons, as the Minister or Ministers think appropriate; and
    
    *   (c) must grant consent if satisfied that all of the criteria in [section 16][23] or [section 18][25] (as the case may be) are met; and
    
    *   (d) must decline to grant consent if not satisfied that all of the criteria in [section 16][23] or [section 18][25] are met.
    
    (2) For a transaction that is in more than 1 category of overseas investment, the relevant Ministers must have regard to the criteria that apply to all of the relevant categories.
    
    (3) However, if the criteria are the same, the relevant Ministers only need to consider the same criteria once (and not consider them under each relevant category).

    *   (b) any associate of A in relation to the overseas investment.
    
    (2) The relevant Minister or Ministers may determine which 1 or more of the following categories of persons are the _individuals with control of the relevant overseas person_ for an overseas investment:
        
    *   (a) the individual or individuals who each have a 25% or more ownership or control interest in the relevant overseas person:
    
    *   (b) the member or members of the governing body of the relevant overseas person:
    
    *   (c) the individual or body of individuals who the Minister or Ministers consider to have that control (whether directly or indirectly).

    *   (d) the relevant overseas person is not, or (if that person is not an individual) each individual with control of the relevant overseas person is not, an individual of a kind referred to in [section 15][120] or [16][121] of the Immigration Act 2009 (which sections list certain persons not eligible for visas or entry permission under that Act):
    
    *   (e) either subparagraph (i) is met or subparagraph (ii) and (if applicable) subparagraph (iii) are met:
            
        *   (i) the relevant overseas person is, or (if that person is not an individual) all the individuals with control of the relevant overseas person are, New Zealand citizens, ordinarily resident in New Zealand, or intending to reside in New Zealand indefinitely:
        
        *   (ii) the overseas investment will, or is likely to, benefit New Zealand (or any part of it or group of New Zealanders), as determined by the relevant Ministers under [section 17][24]:
        
        *   (iii) if the relevant land includes non-urban land that, in area (either alone or together with any associated land) exceeds 5 hectares, the relevant Ministers determine that that benefit will be, or is likely to be, substantial and identifiable:
        
        
    
    *   (f) if the relevant land is or includes farm land, either that farm land or the securities to which the overseas investment relates have been offered for acquisition on the open market to persons who are not overseas persons in accordance with the procedure set out in regulations (unless the overseas investment is exempt from this criterion under [section 20][27]).

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Overseas Investment Act 2005\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 October 2012, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][161] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][162] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][163] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][164] and [17E][165] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
