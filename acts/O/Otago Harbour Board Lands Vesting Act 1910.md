BE IT ENACTED by the General Assembly of New Zealand in Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:---

##### 1 Short Title
    
*   This Act may be cited as the Otago Harbour Board Lands Vesting Act 1910\.

##### 2 Lands in Schedules vested in Board
    
*   The lands described in the Schedules to this Act are hereby vested in the Otago Harbour Board, and the District Land Registrar of the Otago Land Registration District shall accordingly, on the application of the Board, issue a certificate of title for the said lands to the said Board.

##### 3 Power to local authority to reclaim land
    
*   Any local authority within or adjacent to whose district any part of the lands hereinbefore referred to are situated may, with the consent of the Governor in Council and of the Otago Harbour Board, reclaim from the harbour so much of such lands as may be necessary to widen any road along or bounded by the foreshore to ninety-nine feet, and to lay out and form the same; but such reclamation shall not interfere with any wharf, jetty, or works of the said Board:
    
    Provided that before consent is given by the Governor in Council the local authority shall deposit at the office of the Marine Department a plan of the land proposed to be reclaimed, such plan to be prepared by a duly licensed surveyor.

##### 4 Harbour Board to set aside ten acres of land included in Schedule [1][9]
    
*   (1) The Otago Harbour Board shall set apart out of the parcel of land thirdly described in Schedule [1][9] hereto an area of ten acres nineteen perches and nine-tenths of a perch, in such position and with such boundaries as may be agreed upon between such Board and the Bay Town Board, or, if such Boards fail to agree thereon, then the Minister of Marine shall decide.
    
    (2) The area so set apart shall from and after the date fixed therefor by the said Boards, or failing agreement by them, then by the Minister of Marine, cease to be vested in the Otago Harbour Board and be and become subject to Part 2 of the Public Reserves and Domains Act 1908\.
    
    (3) A Proclamation by the Minister of Marine describing or referring to the area set apart as aforesaid, and of the date whereon the same has ceased to be vested in the Otago Harbour Board as aforesaid, shall, when gazetted, be conclusive evidence thereof, whether the position and boundaries of such area or such date respectively are or is fixed by agreement of the said Boards or by the decision of the Minister.
    
    (4) The Otago Harbour Board shall erect flood-gates at or about the bridge in that part of the Lower Portobello Road between Sunshine and Craigleith, as shown on plan MD 3348, referred to in the said Schedule [1][9]; and such flood-gates shall be controlled and maintained by the Bay Town Board.
