*   (1) The Council, after it has approved of a scheme of drainage for the borough, or any portion or portions thereof, consisting of one drainage system or several independent drainage systems, may define one or more drainage-areas within the borough.
    
    (2) Each drainage-area shall include all parts of the borough as in the opinion of the Council will in such scheme of drainage be in the near future directly benefited by the construction and maintenance of one particular independent drainage system.
    
    (3) Any such independent drainage system may be a system of discharging sewage through public drains into the public drains of the City of Wellington with the consent of the Council of the said city, and in such cases may include the laying of water-pipes to connect the several parts of the drainage-area with the water-supply of the said city.
    
    (4) A drainage-area need not be contained within continuous boundaries.
    
    (5) The Council may from time to time redefine any such drainage-area by adding thereto such parts of the borough as in the opinion of the Council are then or will in the immediate future be directly benefited by the construction and maintenance of the drainage system of that drainage-area.
    
    (6) Any owner or occupier of property included in a drainage-area as defined or redefined may, within one month after any determination of the Council defining or redefining any such drainage-area, appeal from such determination to a Judge of the High Court, whose decision shall be final and take the place of the determination of the Council appealed from.
    
    The words ""High Court"" were substituted, as from 1 April 1980, for the words ""Supreme Court"" pursuant to section [12][9] Judicature Amendment Act 1979 (1979 No 124).

##### 4 Special provisions as to borrowing
    
*   After such definition of one or more drainage-areas as above mentioned, the Council may raise a special loan not exceeding in the whole the sum of fifty thousand dollars in one or more sums under the provisions of The Local Bodies' Loans Act 1901 (hereinafter called **the said Act**), in respect of a scheme of drainage approved of as aforesaid, and the following special provisions shall apply:---
        
    *   (a) One loan may be raised although the scheme comprises more than one independent drainage system benefiting different parts of the borough.
    
    *   (b) If there be more than one such independent drainage system, the loan proposed to be raised may, before any steps are taken in respect of the raising of same, be apportioned by the Council between the several drainage-areas defined in manner aforesaid in proportion to the estimated expenditure upon the respective works in connection with the drainage systems of each drainage-area.
    
    *   (c) The special rates to be made and levied under the said Act for the purposes of the said loan may, if the proposed loan be apportioned as aforesaid, be different in different drainage-areas, and shall then in each case be calculated so as to yield, if necessary, ten dollars per centum more than the annual or other charges in respect of the portion of the loan apportioned as above mentioned to the drainage-area in question.
    
    *   (d) The provisions of the said Act as to the preparation of a special roll, as to the actual taking of the poll, as to the proposal to be voted upon, and as to the carrying of proposals at such poll shall in the case of such apportionment as aforesaid apply as if the portion of the proposed loan apportioned to each drainage-area was a separate proposed loan for the purpose of the separate drainage system proposed for that drainage-area; but the steps described in sections seven to thirteen of the said Act shall, save as above mentioned, apply with any necessary alterations as in the case of a single proposed loan for the purpose of the whole drainage scheme.
    
    *   (e) If the proposal is carried in respect of one or more but not all the portions of the proposed loan apportioned to drainage-areas as above mentioned, the proposal shall be deemed to be carried for a loan of the total amount of the portions so carried, and the Council may proceed with the proposal to raise a special loan for that amount for the purpose of carrying out those portions of the scheme of drainage in respect of which the loan proposals shall have been so carried.
    
    *   (f) After the completion of all the said works, the loan, if there has been an apportionment as above mentioned, shall be again apportioned and charged in the accounts of the Council against the several drainage-areas in proportion to the actual expenditure upon the works of each drainage-area, and the special rate actually levied in each drainage-area shall be applicable only to the payment of interest or interest and sinking fund upon that portion of the loan so apportioned and charged to that drainage-area.
    
    *   (g) The Council may, out of any moneys borrowed under this section or out of the district fund of the borough, pay the costs incurred in and about preparing and passing through Parliament this Act.
    
    *   (h) All the rateable property within each drainage-area as defined, or as from time to time redefined as above mentioned, shall be liable to the special rate made and levied as above mentioned in respect of that drainage-area, but any such property added to a drainage-area on a redefinition shall be so liable only in respect of rates which become thereafter payable.
