    (2) In the case of a detained person who is charged with an offence to which the [Bail Act 2000][37] applies, the court must not make an order under this section if the court is of the opinion that bail would not be granted to that person under that Act.
    
    (3) If a person has been released from detention under an interim order, the court may, on the application of the person released or any party to the proceeding or on the court's own initiative, make an order---

    *   (b) varying or revoking any condition of the interim order or substituting or imposing any other condition.
    
    (4) If a detained person who is in custody under a conviction is released under an interim order, the time during which the person is released does not count as part of any term of detention under the person's sentence if on a final determination of the application the writ of habeas corpus is refused.

##### 12 Power of arrest of absconder etc
    
*   (1) A constable may arrest without warrant a person who has been released from detention under an interim order made under [section 11][13] if the constable believes on reasonable grounds that---
        
    *   (a) the person released has absconded, or is about to abscond, for the purpose of evading any appearance or further appearance in court in connection with the application or the person's original detention; or
    
    *   (b) the person has failed to comply with any condition attached to the interim order.
    
    (2) A person who is arrested under this section must be brought before the High Court as soon as possible.
    
    (3) The court may revoke the interim order if it is satisfied that the person had absconded or was about to abscond or had failed to comply with a condition attached to the interim order or an undertaking to the court in reliance on which the interim order was made.
    
    (4) A constable may, for the purposes of this section, enter at any time onto any premises, by force if necessary, if the constable has reasonable cause to believe that the person released from detention is on those premises.
    
    (5) If the constable is not in uniform and a person in actual occupation of the premises requires the constable to produce evidence of his or her authority, the constable must, before entering on the premises, produce his or her badge or other evidence of membership of the Police.

##### 14 Determination of applications

    (1A) Despite subsection (1), the High Court may refuse an application for the issue of the writ, without requiring the defendant to establish that the detention of the detained person is lawful, if the court is satisfied that---
        
    *   (a) [section 15(1)][18] applies; or
    
    *   (b) an application for the issue of a writ of habeas corpus is not the appropriate procedure for considering the allegations made by the applicant.
    
    (2) A Judge dealing with an application must enquire into the matters of fact and law claimed to justify the detention and is not confined in that enquiry to the correction of jurisdictional errors; but this subsection does not entitle a Judge to call into question---
        
    *   (a) a conviction of an offence by a court of competent jurisdiction, the Court Martial of New Zealand established under [section 8][41] of the Court Martial Act 2007, or a disciplinary officer acting under [Part 5][42] of the Armed Forces Discipline Act 1971; or
    
    *   (b) a ruling as to bail by a court of competent jurisdiction.

    (2) A person who has been released from detention in accordance with a writ of habeas corpus must not be re-arrested or detained again on substantially the same grounds as those considered by the court when the earlier release was ordered.
    
    (3) Subsection (2) has no application if the ground on which the earlier release was ordered was a jurisdictional or procedural defect that has since been corrected or no longer applies.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Habeas Corpus Act 2001\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 30 March 2013, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][55] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][56] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][57] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][58] and [17E][59] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
