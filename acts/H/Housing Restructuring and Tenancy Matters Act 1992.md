    ###### Example
    
    Mary is a tenant of HNZ and is paying an income-related rent to HNZ. On 1 March, Mary returned to full-time employment but did not tell the agency of her change in circumstances.
    
    Several months later, the agency becomes aware that Mary's circumstances had changed on 1 March. The agency calculates an increased income-related rent for Mary, and notifies HNZ accordingly. The increased income-related rent does not exceed the market rent for the housing.
    
    On 1 October that same year, HNZ notifies Mary that she must pay an increased income-related rent (in accordance with the agency's notification) from the rent period beginning on 21 October (the effective date).
    
    The agency is entitled to recover from Mary, as a debt due to the Crown, the difference between---
        
    *   (a) the higher income-related rent for the housing (as set out in the agency's notification), in respect of the period commencing on 1 May (61 days after the change in circumstances) and ending on 20 October; and

    ###### Example
    
    Mary is a tenant of a registered community housing provider and is paying an income-related rent to the provider. On 1 March, Mary returned to full-time employment but did not tell the agency of her change in circumstances.
    
    Several months later, the agency becomes aware that Mary's circumstances had changed on 1 March. The agency calculates an increased income-related rent for Mary, and notifies the registered community housing provider accordingly. The increased income-related rent does not exceed the market rent for the housing.
    
    On 1 October that same year, the registered community housing provider notifies Mary that she must pay an increased income-related rent (in accordance with the agency's notification) from the rent period beginning on 21 October (the effective date).
    
    The agency is entitled to recover from Mary, as a debt due to the Crown, the difference between---

*   (1) On the date that Part 7 commences,---
