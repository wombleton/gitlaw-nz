    *   (c) whose positions will, as a result of the transfer of functions to the agency, cease to exist within the Corporation.
    
    (2) An employee who is identified under subclause (1) may be offered equivalent employment by the agency, being employment that is---
        
    *   (a) in substantially the same position; and
    
    *   (b) in the same general locality; and
    
    *   (c) on terms and conditions that are no less favourable than those applying to the employee immediately before the date the offer of employment is made to that employee; and

    (3) The employee is not entitled to receive any payment or other benefit on the ground that the position held by the person in the Corporation has ceased to exist if---
        
    *   (a) the employee's position ceases to exist because the duties of the position are more closely connected with the functions of the agency; and
    
    *   (b) the employee is offered employment in an equivalent position in the agency (whether or not the employee accepts the offer).
    
    (4) This clause overrides any provision to the contrary in [Part 6A][315] of the Employment Relations Act 2000\.

##### 17 No compensation for technical redundancy of employees of Corporation
    
*   (1) An employee of the Corporation is not entitled to receive any payment or other benefit on the ground that the position held by the person in the Corporation has ceased to exist if the employee's position ceases to exist because the duties of the position are more closely connected with the functions of the agency, and---
        
    *   (a) the employee is offered employment in an equivalent position in the agency (whether or not the employee accepts the offer); or

    (2) In subclause (1)(a), _employment in an equivalent position_ means employment that is---

##### 18 Consequences of transfer of functions to agency
    
*   (1) On the date that Part 7 commences,---
        
    *   (a) all relevant information held by HNZ or the Corporation is held by the agency; and
    
    *   (b) any relevant thing done, or omitted to be done, or that is to be done, by or in relation to HNZ or the Corporation is to be treated as having been done, or having been omitted to be done, or to be done, by or in relation to the agency.
    
    (2) In this clause,---
    
    _relevant information_ means all information that relates to the exercise of a function or power of HNZ or the Corporation that is, on the commencement of Part 7, a function or power of the agency
    
    _relevant thing_ means any thing that relates to a function or power of HNZ or the Corporation that, on the commencement of Part 7, is a function or power of the agency.
    
    (3) The transfer of information from HNZ or the Corporation to the agency under subclause (1)(a) does not constitute an action that is an interference with the privacy of an individual under [section 66][319] of the Privacy Act 1993\.

##### 19 No claims for breach of contract
    
*   No claim for breach of contract lies against HNZ, the Corporation, the agency, or any of their employees in respect of any information, knowledge, intellectual property, or goods to which the agency has gained access or has acquired as a result of the transfer of functions of HNZ and the Corporation to the agency.
