*   #### Preamble
    
    WHEREAS by a deed dated the twentieth day of May, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-three, and made between John Carey, of Hamilton, surgeon, of the one part, and Patrick Leslie, of Tamahere, Alfred Cox, of Ohaupo, and Samuel Thomas Seddon, of Hamilton, Esquires, of the other part, the said John Carey conveyed and assured unto the said Patrick Leslie, Alfred Cox, and Samuel Thomas Seddon, and their heirs, for and on behalf of the General Synod of the Branch of the United Church of England and Ireland in New Zealand, all that piece or parcel of land described in the Schedule hereto, with all the rights and appurtenances thereto belonging, upon trust that the said Patrick Leslie, Alfred Cox, and Samuel Thomas Seddon, or other the trustees for the time being, shall and do stand seised and interested in the said land for the site of a parsonage for the use of a minister of the United Church of England and Ireland in New Zealand: And whereas at the time the said land was conveyed in trust as aforesaid there was on the said land a building suitable for a residence for a minister as aforesaid, but such building is now decayed and useless, and there is now no building on the said land suitable for a residence for a minister as aforesaid: And whereas it is desirable to empower the trustees of the said land to exchange the same for other freehold lands and hereditaments, to be used as a site for a parsonage, with a residence for a minister thereon, or to sell or lease the said land, and with the money to arise from such sale or lease to purchase other freehold land and hereditaments, to be used as aforesaid:
