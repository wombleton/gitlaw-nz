## Schedule  
Provisions relating to restructuring of Board

[s 9(3)][12]

##### 1 Consequential provisions on restructuring as company
    
*   (1) Without limiting the generality of [section 9][12], the following provisions have effect on and after the restructuring day:
        
    *   (a) a reference (whether express or implied) to the Board in any instrument must be read and construed as a reference to the company:
    
    *   (b) all money payable to the Board is payable to the company:
    
    *   (c) proceedings that could have been commenced or continued by or against the Board before its conversion may be commenced or continued by or against the company:
    
    *   (d) the deemed registration of the company does not affect any rights, interests, liabilities, or obligations existing immediately before the conversion of the Board:
    
    *   (e) all transactions entered into by, and acts of, the Board before its conversion must be treated as having been entered into by, or to be those of the company, at the time when they were entered into or performed by the Board:
    
    *   (f) all contracts, agreements, conveyances, deeds, leases, licences, and other instruments, undertakings, and notices (whether or not in writing) entered into by, made by, given to or by, or addressed to the Board (whether alone or with any other person) existing immediately before the restructuring day are, to the extent that they were previously binding on and enforceable by, against, or in favour of the Board, binding on and enforceable by, against, or in favour of the company.
    
    (2) Subclause (1)(f) applies as if the company, instead of the Board, had been the person by whom the contract, agreement, conveyance, deed, lease, instrument, or undertaking was entered into, made, given, or addressed (as the case may be).

##### 2 Certain matters not affected by transfer to company
    
*   Nothing effected or authorised by this Act---
        
    *   (a) must be regarded as placing the Board or the company, or any other person, in breach of contract or confidence or as otherwise making any of them liable of a civil wrong; or
    
    *   (b) must be regarded as giving rise to a right for any person to terminate or cancel a contract or arrangement, or to accelerate the performance of any obligation; or
    
    *   (c) must be regarded as placing the Board or the company, or any other person, in breach of an enactment, rule of law, or contractual provision prohibiting, restricting, or regulating the assignment or transfer of property or the disclosure of information; or
    
    *   (d) releases a surety wholly or in part from any obligation; or
    
    *   (e) invalidates or discharges any contract.
    
    

##### 3 Initial directors of company
    
*   (1) The initial directors of the company are the existing members of the Board who consent to be directors of the company.
    
    (2) The term of office of an initial director expires on the date on which the director's term on the Board would have expired had the Board not converted into the company.

##### 4 Employees of Board
    
*   (1) Despite any other provision of this Act,---
        
    *   (a) on the restructuring day every person who is employed by the Board must be treated as having transferred to the company; and
    
    *   (b) for the purposes of every enactment, award, determination, contract, or agreement, the person's transfer from the Board to the company is insufficient to break the person's employment agreement.
    
    (2) The terms and conditions of employment of a transferred employee with the company on the restructuring day (and after that until varied) are identical to the terms and conditions of his or her employment with the Board immediately before the restructuring day and are capable of variation in the same manner.
    
    (3) A transferred employee is not entitled to receive any payment or other benefit solely because the person has, by virtue of this Act, ceased to be an employee of the Board and become an employee of the company.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Hop Industry Restructuring Act 2003\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 April 2008, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/legislation/reprints.shtml.

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][36] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/legislation/reprints.shtml or Part 8 of the _Tables of Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][37] and [17E][38] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
