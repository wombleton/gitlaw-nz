    (1) Provide, construct, and lay any new private drains from any part or parts of such premises, and connect such new private drains with such public drain or covered watercourse or street-channel as the Council shall direct;
    
    (2) Cleanse and repair, and relay and alter the course and direction and outfall of, or take up and disconnect, any existing private drain of or belonging to such premises;
    
    (3) Connect any such existing private drain with any public drain or covered watercourse or street-channel other than the public drain, covered watercourse, or street-channel with which the same shall previously have been connected;

    (6) Execute, provide, and do generally any works, materials, and things which, in the opinion of the Council, shall be necessary or expedient for the efficient drainage of such premises, and every part thereof.
    
    Every such notice as aforesaid shall specify the works, materials, and things to be executed, provided, or done thereunder, and the public drain or covered watercourse or street-channel with which any private drain shall be required to be connected, and shall limit a time within which the same works, materials, and things shall be so executed, provided, and done.

##### 4 Power to Council where existing private drain passes through several separately owned premises
    
*   In any case in which any such existing private drain passes through or serves several separately owned premises, or any such new private drain is to pass or serve, the Council shall notify the respective owners of such premises to execute, provide, and do such parts of the works, materials, and things under section [three][3] hereof as the Council shall in and by the respective notices served on such owners direct; or the Council may in any such case elect to do the whole work, upon notifying such respective owners as aforesaid. The Council may by notice declare that any existing or new drain in question shall, as from the time to be mentioned in that behalf in the notice, become a public drain, and the same shall without any other proceeding become a public drain accordingly.

##### 5 Stream or watercourse may be covered in
    
*   The Council may enclose and cover in any stream or watercourse within the city which, by reason of sewage or other offensive matter therein, or from any other cause whatever, has, or in the opinion of the Council may, become a nuisance or dangerous to the public health, and for such purpose may make, construct, and lay down such drains or do such other works as may in the opinion of the Council be necessary for the covering-in of such stream or watercourse, and the removal therefrom of any sewage or other matter which in the opinion of the Council it may be advisable to exclude therefrom, and in connection with such works may straighten or otherwise alter the course and direction of such stream or watercourse, and take up, disconnect, alter, relay, or otherwise deal with any private drains communicating with such stream or watercourse; and the Council shall not be liable to pay compensation in respect of any one being deprived of the water flowing in such stream or watercourse, or of the right to such water, nor for any damage or inconvenience occasioned to the owners or occupiers of such lands or premises, but shall nevertheless make good any damage or injury caused during the construction of the works.

##### 6 Money due by owners of premises may be paid by instalments
    
*   Every sum of money payable by an owner of any premises under or by virtue of any provision of this Act hereinbefore or hereinafter contained, for or in respect of any works, materials, or things executed, provided, or done by the Council in pursuance of this Act or of any by-law made hereunder, may be divided into instalments extending over ten years, with interest at the rate of four dollars fifty cents per centum per annum added, and each such instalment shall be recoverable in like manner in every respect as if it were a general rate of the borough duly made in respect of the premises in question under the statutory provisions under which the general rate of the borough should for the time being be made, subject nevertheless to the following conditions:---
    
    (1) The owner for the time being of the premises in question shall in all cases be deemed the person primarily liable for payment.
    
    (2) The first instalment shall become due on the first half-yearly day for payment of such general rate happening at least three calendar months after the date, to be certified in writing by the Drainage Engineer, of the completion of the work in respect whereof the payment is to be made. The remaining instalments shall respectively become due on the nineteen succeeding half-yearly days for payment of the general rates.
    
    (3) A separate book shall be kept by the Collector of Rates to the Council in which particulars of all such instalments, and of the works in respect whereof they are payable, and the dates for payment thereof, and of the names of the persons paying the same, shall be entered, which book shall be _prima facie_ evidence of the correctness of its contents.
    
    (4) The owner for the time being may at any time, on giving to the Council one calendar month's previous written notice, pay to the Corporation, and the Corporation may receive, the whole of the unpaid parts of such sum of money, and such owner shall be entitled to a rebate representing the future interest.
    
    The words ""four dollars fifty cents"" were substituted, as from 10 July 1967, for the words ""four pounds ten shillings"" pursuant to section [7(2)][29] Decimal Currency Act 1964 (1964 No 27).

##### 7 Power to make by-laws under preceding sections
    
*   The Council may, in manner provided by [Local Government Act 1974][30], from time to time make, alter, and repeal, and bring into force, all such by-laws as it shall think proper and reasonable for the purpose of carrying out or giving further effect to the provisions of sections [three][3], [four][4], [five][5], and [six][6] hereof, and in particular, but not so as to limit the foregoing general power, the Council may by any such by-law,---
    
    (1) Prescribe the forms of any notices, and direct by whom the same shall or may be signed, and the manner of service thereof;
    
    (2) Direct in what cases the expense of the works described in all or any of such sections shall be borne by the Council, and in what cases by the owner or owners of the premises, and in what cases, if any, partly by the Council and partly by such owner or owners;
    
    (3) Provide for the conclusive ascertainment of the expense of such works, and of the portion payable by any owner or owners, and of the proportions payable by the respective owners of separately owned premises;
