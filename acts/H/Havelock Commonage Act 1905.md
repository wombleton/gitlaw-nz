##### 3 Trustees incorporated
    
*   The Trustees are hereby declared to be a body corporate by the name of ""The Town of Havelock Commonage Trustees"", by which name they shall have perpetual succession and a common seal, and may sue and be sued, and may do and suffer all such acts and things as bodies corporate may do and suffer; and all property now vested in them shall continue to be so vested.

##### 4 Appointment of new Trustees
    
*   (1) If any of the Trustees resigns, or is absent from the Provincial District of Otago for twelve consecutive months, or becomes bankrupt, or is convicted of an offence punishable by imprisonment for two years or upwards, or becomes insane, or refuses to act in the execution of the Trust hereby created, he shall cease to be a member of the Trust, and the Governor may from time to time appoint another person in his place.
    
    (2) The appointment of such new Trustee shall be conclusive evidence that the person in whose stead he has been appointed has ceased to be a member of the Trust.

##### 5 Trustees may manage land as a commonage
    
*   (1) The Trustees shall manage the lands described in the Schedule hereto as a commonage for the inhabitants of the Town of Havelock in such manner as they think most expedient, and may issue licenses authorising any of the said inhabitants to depasture cattle thereon, on payment of such fee as the Trustees from time to time fix and determine.
    
    (2) The Trustees may also cause to be planted such portions of the said lands as they deem expedient, and may fence off such portions from the remainder:
    
    Provided that the powers hereby conferred shall be exercised subject to the provisions hereinafter contained for the use or occupation of the said lands for gold-mining purposes.

##### 6 Application of money received by trustees under the Havelock Commonage Act 1905
    
*   (1) Any money received by the trustees in respect of rents, the issue of licences, licence fees, or profits from the said land may be applied for all or any of the following objects and for no other object:
        
    *   (a) For the improvement or beautifying of the said land or any other land held in trust for the inhabitants of the Town of Havelock:

##### 8 Management of land to become vested in town when incorporated
    
*   If at any time the Town of Havelock becomes a borough, the management of the said lands shall become vested in the Council of the borough upon the same trusts as are herein expressed, and thereafter all the powers conferred on the Trustees by this Act shall become vested in such Council, and the corporate body hereby created shall become dissolved.

##### 9 Land subject to provisions of goldfields laws
    
*   Notwithstanding anything in this or any other Act, the said lands shall be and remain subject to the provisions of the laws for the time being in force relating to or affecting goldfields, in the same manner as if they had continued to be Crown land forming part of a goldfield; and all moneys to be derived from the issue of any miners' rights or business licenses, or otherwise for or in respect of the use or occupation of the same for gold-mining purposes, shall be paid to the same persons or authorities, and by them applied in the same manner as moneys derived from a goldfield are for the time being applied.
