    (2) The Committee shall consist of the persons holding office as members thereof at the passing of this Act, and of such other persons as may from time to time hereafter be appointed as members by the Minister. Any member of the Committee may at any time resign his membership by writing addressed to the Minister.
    
    (3) Every member of the Committee who is a member by virtue of the office or position held by him shall continue to be a member of the Committee only so long as he continues to hold such office or position, and every person who may be hereafter appointed or elected to any such office or position shall, by virtue thereof, be a member of the Committee.
    
    (4) If any question arises as to whether any person is a member of the Committee, the question shall be determined by the Minister, whose decision shall be final.

##### 4 Procedure at meetings of Committee
    
*   (1) The Minister shall be the Chairman of the Committee.
    
    (2) In the absence of the Chairman from any meeting of the Committee, the members present shall appoint one of their number to be chairman at that meeting.
    
    (3) On any question before the Committee, the Chairman shall have a deliberative vote and, in case of an equality of votes, shall also have a casting vote.
    
    (4) The decision of a majority of the members of the Committee shall be deemed to be the decision of the Committee.
    
    (5) The fact that any person attends and acts as a member of the Committee shall be conclusive proof of his authority so to act.
    
    (6) The Committee shall at all times cause proper minute-books to be kept in which shall be entered a full and faithful record of all the proceedings at each meeting with proper details of the business transacted thereat.
    
    (7) The Committee shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, determine its own procedure.

##### 5 Funds held by Public Trustee to vest in Committee
    
*   Immediately on the passing of this Act every Earthquake Relief Fund held by the Public Trustee on behalf of the Central Committee shall vest in the Committee, subject to all liabilities, charges, obligations, and trusts affecting the same.

##### 6 Committee to undertake administration of other funds
    
*   The Committee shall at the request in writing of the trustees of any Earthquake Relief Fund undertake the control and administration of such fund for the purposes for which it is established or for any purpose authorized under the provisions of this Act, and the trustees of every such fund, whether established before or after the passing of this Act, are hereby authorized by writing under their hands to transfer the fund and the administration thereof to the Committee.

*   (1) The Committee shall stand possessed of any Earthquake Relief Fund that is vested in or transferred to it upon trust for the purposes for which such fund is established or for any purpose authorized by the provisions of this Act, and shall administer every such fund in accordance with the provisions of this Act in such manner as the Committee from time to time by resolution determines.

    (3) Where the moneys belonging to any Earthquake Relief Fund are, in the opinion of the Governor-General in Council, more than sufficient to meet all reasonable requirements of the fund for the purposes for which it was established, he may, on the application in writing of the Committee (in the case of a fund vested in or controlled by the Committee) or of the trustees of any other fund, define such purposes as he thinks fit (being purposes for which an Earthquake Relief Fund may be established) to be purposes of the said fund, and thereupon the moneys in the said fund may be expended for all or any of the purposes so defined.

##### 16 Advances out of funds by way of loan may be recovered
    
*   Where any moneys have, whether before or after the passing of this Act, been advanced out of an Earthquake Relief Fund by the Committee, or by the trustees of any such fund, on terms requiring the repayment of such moneys with or without interest, such moneys and the interest thereon (if any) shall be recoverable in accordance with the terms of the agreement, at the suit of the Committee in the case of a fund vested in or controlled by the Committee at the date when the action is brought, and in any other case at the suit of the trustees. All moneys recovered under this section at the suit of the Committee shall be paid to the Public Trustee, on behalf of the Committee, and the receipt of the Public Trustee shall be a sufficient discharge therefor.
