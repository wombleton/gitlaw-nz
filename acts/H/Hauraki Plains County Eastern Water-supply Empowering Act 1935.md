An Act to enable the Hauraki Plains County Council to take, divert, and impound Water in certain Streams in the Hauraki Mining District for supplying Water to Parts of the County of Hauraki Plains and to the County of Thames, and to validate an Agreement made between such Council and the Thames County Council.
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    WHEREAS it is expedient to enable the Hauraki Plains County Council to take, divert, and impound the waters flowing into and in the stream in the County of Thames in the Hauraki Mining District called Apakura Stream, and the tributary thereof called Canoe Creek, for the purpose of supplying water to the inhabitants of portions of the County of Hauraki Plains and to part of the County of Thames, and for the same purpose to empower such Council to lay mains and pipes from such streams to the County of Hauraki Plains over reserves and roads and across the Paeroa-Thames railway-line and the Waihou River, which powers are not presently vested in such Council in respect of lands within a mining district: And whereas there is no source of water suitable for the aforesaid purpose available except in the Hauraki Mining District above mentioned: And whereas the said Council and the Thames County Council have entered into an agreement respecting the user of such water, and it is desirable that such agreement should be validated to set at rest any doubts as to the legality thereof:

BE IT THEREFORE ENACTED by the General Assembly of New Zealand in Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:---

##### 1 Short Title
    
*   This Act may be cited as the Hauraki Plains County Eastern Water-supply Empowering Act 1935\.

*   The Hauraki Plains County Council is hereby empowered to take, divert, and impound the water flowing into and in the streams known as Apakura Stream and Canoe Creek, situated in Blocks IX and XIII, Tairua Survey District, in such manner as to the Hauraki Plains County Council shall seem expedient, for the purpose of supplying the same to inhabitants in parts of the County of Hauraki Plains, and to lay mains and pipes from the said streams to the County of Hauraki Plains through part of the County of Thames, in the Hauraki Mining District, along reserves and roads, and across the Thames-Paeroa Railway and the Waihou River, and to convey water through such mains and pipes:
    
    Provided that the authority hereby conferred to lay pipes across the said railway and the said river shall be exercised only with the consent of and in a manner approved of by the Government Railways Board in respect of the railway and the Minister of Transport and the Minister of Works and Development in respect of the river.
    
    The reference to the ""Minister of Transport"" was substituted for a reference to the ""Minister of Marine"" by section 6(1) of the Ministry of Transport Amendment Act 1972\.
    
    The reference to the ""Minister of Works and Development"" was by section 2(4)(a) of the Public Works Amendment Act 1974, substituted for a reference to the ""Minister of Works"", which by section 2(5) of the Ministry of Works Act 1943 had been substituted for a reference to the ""Minister of Public Works"".

##### 3 Exclusion of the Mining Act 1926
    
*   (1) The said streams shall be deemed removed from the operation of the Mining Act 1926, as from the commencement of the construction of works by the Hauraki Plains County Council.
    
    (2) From the date of the passing of this Act no mining rights, licenses, or easements over such streams or either of them shall be granted or created, and such streams and their several tributaries shall not thereafter be proclaimed tail-races or watercourses into which tailings, mining debris, or waste water may be discharged:
    
    Provided that if on the first day of July, nineteen hundred and forty-one, or such later date in that behalf as may be fixed by the Minister of the Crown, the Hauraki Plains County Council shall not have commenced the construction of the water-supply works aforesaid, then and in such case only the restrictions imposed by this section shall cease to apply to such streams.
    
    The reference to the ""Minister of Energy"" was substituted, as from 1 April 1978, for the reference to the ""Minister of Mines"" by section 23 of the Ministry of Energy Act 1977\. That Act was in turn repealed, and the reference to the ""Minister of Energy"" substituted, as from 2 January 1990, by a reference to ""Minister of the Crown"" pursuant to section [4][11] of the Ministry of Energy (Abolition) Act 1989 (1989 No 140).

##### 4 Water Supply Act 1908, to apply
    
*   The provisions of the Water Supply Act 1908, shall apply to the works and operations authorized by this Act in the same manner as if the said streams and the line of the said mains and pipes were not in a mining district notwithstanding the provisions of subsection four of section one of the Water Supply Act 1908:
    
    Provided that the supply of water to be made by the Hauraki Plains County Council to the Thames County Council under the agreement hereinafter validated shall not be affected by the provisions of section eleven of the Water Supply Act 1908\.

## Schedule

THIS deed is made the 7th day of August 1934 between the body corporate named the Chairman Councillors and Inhabitants of the County of Thames (which with its successors is hereinafter deemed to be included in and bound by the term **The Thames County Council**) of the one part and the body corporate named the Chairman Councillors and Inhabitants of the County of Hauraki Plains (which with its successors is hereinafter deemed to be included in and bound by the term **The Hauraki Plains County Council**) of the other part Whereas the said bodies corporate are local authorities duly constituted under the Counties Act 1920 And whereas the respective counties of such bodies corporate are proximate to each other And whereas the County of Thames is within the Hauraki Mining District And whereas the portion of the County of Hauraki Plains on the eastern side of the Piako River is lacking a supply of pure fresh water within its boundaries and within the Thames County there is a suitable supply of water in a stream named the Apakura Stream and a tributary thereof named Canoe Creek and licenses under the Mining Act 1926 for a water-race and for a dam-site in respect of the said Apakura Stream were granted to the Thames County Council for the term of forty-two (42) years from the 20th day of April 1928 but no works have yet been constructed by the Thames County Council upon the said Apakura Stream And whereas the Hauraki Plains County Council being desirous of acquiring rights to use the water from the said stream applied to the Warden of the Hauraki Mining District at Thames for a grant of licenses to such water but it appears that the Hauraki Plains County Council has no legal power or authority to acquire such rights under the Mining Act 1926 or to appropriate and use such water under any other statute And whereas the application of the Hauraki Plains County Council was opposed by the Thames County Council and the said applications were adjourned to enable further consideration of the legal position and the said County Councils have conferred and come to an agreement upon the terms and conditions hereinafter contained Now this deed witnesseth and it is hereby agreed by and between the said bodies corporate:---

##### 1
    
*   The Hauraki Plains County Council shall promote and procure if possible the passage of legislation empowering such Hauraki Plains County Council to construct water-works drawing water from the said Apakura Stream and the said Canoe Creek and to construct and maintain a water-race or pipe-line over the reserves adjoining the said stream and creek and over the roads of the Thames County to the Waihou River and validating this deed and the contract for the supply of water to the Thames County Council herein contained and the Thames County Council shall assist in the procuring of such empowering and validating legislation in so far as such assistance may be necessary or desirable.
