    provided that before connecting any such sewer the contributing authority shall submit to the Board complete plans and specifications thereof; and the Engineer to the Board shall be satisfied that the sewer or sewers referred to in the plans and specifications are fit and proper to be so connected and to form part of the general drainage system of the Board and that the sewage to be discharged through the same into the main sewer will be of such volume as to be within the capacity of such main sewer having regard to the volume of other sewage which may reasonably be discharged into that main sewer.

##### 33 Works to be efficiently done
    
*   In making any connection pursuant to [section 32][37] the contributing authority shall cause it to be done in a skilled, efficient, and workmanlike manner, and shall ensure that the efficiency and construction of the main sewers are in no way impaired or endangered; and that in every case the connection is made in such manner as the Engineer to the Board directs.

##### 34 Connection of sewer in different districts
    
*   The Board may permit any local authority outside the district to connect any sewer within the area of that local authority with any sewer vested in or controlled by the Board on such terms as may be agreed upon between the Board and that local authority.

    (2) The Board may undertake and carry out, maintain, and operate drainage works, whether in relation to storm water or sewage, for the benefit of any areas within or adjacent to the district, and may enter into and enforce agreements with local authorities and other persons for the payment of the whole or any portion of the costs of the construction, maintenance, or operation of any such works.

##### 36 Watercourses
    
*   Subject to [section 27][32], the Board may utilise any natural watercourse within the district for the discharge of storm-water overflows from its main sewers, but so that the discharge from any such watercourse into any harbour or any other place under the control of the Wellington Harbour Board, or into any river under the control of the Hutt River Board, shall not be or become a nuisance.

##### 37 Surface-water drains
    
*   The Board may enter into and carry out contracts with any constituent authority for the construction of drains for the removal of surface water or for the alteration or improvement of such drains or of any natural watercourse or channel within the district of the constituent authority which the constituent authority is empowered to construct.

All such details and information as the Board may require shall be supplied within 1 month after receipt of notice from the Board. Any person who may hereafter propose to operate any trade premises within the drainage district shall in a like manner submit such information as the Board may specify before he commences any process or operation which will or may result in the discharge of trade wastes, noxious matters, or condensing water.

##### 40 Exemption from requirement to discharge trade wastes through main sewer
    
*   (1) Any occupier of trade premises may at any time apply to the Board for exemption from the provisions of [section 38][44] in respect of the whole or any part of the trade wastes discharged or to be discharged from the said trade premises; and the Board may, subject to the provisions of this section, grant or refuse the application, and, if it grants the application, may impose such conditions as it thinks fit.
    
    (2) Every applicant shall submit with his application for exemption such information as the Board may consider relevant; and shall further supply on the request of the Board or of any officer of the Board duly authorised in that behalf, any additional information which may be necessary to enable the Board to give full consideration to the application.
    
    (3) An application for exemption shall be granted by the Board if there is no public sewer of sufficient capacity so located that it would be reasonable for the Board to require discharge to that public sewer of trade wastes discharged or to be discharged from the trade premises concerned and if, in the opinion of the Board, trade wastes in respect of which the application for exemption is made are of such quality, or, prior to discharge from the trade premises concerned, are being or will be purified or treated at the expense of the occupier to such a degree or in such a manner, that their discharge to a watercourse or to tidal waters will not prejudicially affect such watercourse or tidal waters.
    
    (4) Any exemption from the provisions of [section 38][44] which may be granted by the Board under the authority of this section may be withdrawn by the service of reasonable notice (being not less than 3 months) on the occupier of the trade premises concerned if it appears to the Board at any time that the grounds upon, or the circumstances under, which any such application was granted no longer exist or may have ceased to exist on the expiry of the period specified in the notice or that the occupier has committed or permitted or suffered a breach of any of the conditions imposed by the Board in the grant of exemption.
    
    (5) Any exemption granted by the Board under this section may at any time, by notice, be withdrawn by the Board if the Minister of Health for any reason directs such withdrawal.

    (7) In all cases in which the Board may have granted an exemption under the provisions of subsection (1), and in all cases in which it may have withdrawn its consent, the Board shall give notice of the action which it has taken to the constituent authority concerned and, where appropriate, to the Wellington Harbour Board.
    
    (8) The right of any person at common law arising from any nuisance or pollution, and the provisions of any Act relating to nuisance or pollution, shall not be prejudiced or affected by reason only of any exemption granted by the Board under the provisions of subsection (1), or by reason of any approval or consent given by the Board, with or without conditions, pursuant to this section.

##### 41 Trade wastes drains
    
*   (1) After the passing of this Act, no trade wastes drain shall be connected to a public sewer or main sewerage work within the drainage district, nor shall any trade wastes drain connected to a public sewer or main sewerage work within the drainage district be altered or extended, without the prior consent of the Board; and in granting any such consent the Board may impose such conditions as it deems necessary.
    
    (2) The cost of construction or alteration or extension of any trade wastes drain as aforesaid, and the cost of connecting the drain to a public sewer or to a main sewerage work, shall be borne by the occupier of the trade premises concerned:
    
    provided that no occupier shall be liable for the cost of the construction of any trade wastes drain for more than a reasonable distance from a public sewer to the nearest boundary of the land on which the trade premises concerned are situated.
    
    (3) Should any dispute arise as to any such liability it shall be referred to arbitration in accordance with [section 83][95].

##### 42 Treatment of trade wastes
    
*   (1) Every occupier of trade premises from which trade wastes are discharged either directly or indirectly into any public sewer shall, prior to discharge pretreat the trade wastes, at his own expense, to such degree as the Board from time to time may require:
    
    provided that the Board shall not require pretreatment of trade wastes to any extent greater than is necessary to ensure that on discharge into any such sewer the trade wastes are of such quality that the capital, operational, and maintenance costs of further treatment to whatever degree may be necessary to meet the reasonable requirements of the Board will be no greater than the costs of treatment to a like degree of the same volume of domestic sewage.
    
    (2) If it appears to the Board that any trade wastes are of such quality that they are not likely to damage or obstruct any public sewer or any of the Board's main sewerage works or to render unduly difficult the treatment of domestic sewage with which they may become intermingled, the Board shall, on application for the purpose by the occupier of the trade premises concerned, grant permission to him to discharge those trade wastes into such sewers under the control of the Board as shall be specified by the Board, subject to compliance by that occupier with the provisions of this Act, and to payment by him of such charges, and compliance by him with such requirements, as may be set forth in the bylaws for the time being of the Board, and to compliance by him with such additional requirements (if any) as the Board may reasonably decide to impose, having regard to any special circumstances or unusual factors involved.
    
    (3) The Board may enter into agreements with occupiers of trade premises whereby the Board may undertake, at the cost of the occupier concerned, to design, construct, operate, or maintain works for the pretreatment of any such trade wastes as aforesaid.
    
    (4) If the Board in exercise of its power under subsection (1) requires any occupier of trade premises to pretreat trade wastes, and if the Board pursuant to the provisions of subsection (3) enters into an agreement with any occupier of trade premises to design, construct, operate, or maintain works for the pretreatment of trade wastes, then any net profits which may result from the operations of the Board in connection with such pretreatment (after taking into account the cost of design, construction, operation, and maintenance of the works and all incidental expenses) shall not be treated as part of the general funds of the Board so that the benefit thereof may accrue to the contributing authorities, but shall be so dealt with that, after repayment of all capital, operational, maintenance, and other charges whatsoever, including an equitable contribution to general administrative charges of the Board, any balance of net profits available can be allocated by the Board to the occupiers of trade premises concerned in the creation of the profits, in such manner as the Board may from time to time, by resolution, decide; and the Board shall so allocate any such balance of net profits.

##### 43 Treatment and disposal of noxious matters
    
*   (1) No person shall discharge any noxious matters from any part of the district into any sewer or into any watercourse or into tidal waters or in or on to any place within the limits of the Wellington Harbour or under the jurisdiction of the Wellington Harbour Board or in or on to any place where they might be carried, by the wind or tide or otherwise, within the limits of the harbour or in or on to any place under the jurisdiction of the harbour board, or within 3 miles of any foreshore within or contiguous to the drainage district or to any point of disposal on land.
    
    (2) The treatment, prior to disposal, of all noxious matters discharged within or from the drainage district shall be the responsibility of and shall be carried out at the cost of the person responsible for the discharge of such noxious matters as aforesaid:
    
    provided that the Board may enter into agreements with persons responsible for the discharge of noxious matters whereby the Board may undertake, at the cost of the persons concerned, to design, construct, operate, and maintain pretreatment works for the conversion of the said matters into non-noxious matters, and for the subsequent acceptance of the products of that treatment process into a public sewer or main sewerage work.

##### 44 Treatment of petroleum, etc
    
*   Every person in control of any premises within the drainage district from which petroleum products or any explosive or inflammable matters may be discharged into any public sewer or into a watercourse or into tidal waters shall install, and operate effectively, an intercepting chamber of such form as the Board may specify or approve. Compliance with the requirements of a licence for the time being in force under the Explosives Act 1957 or the Dangerous Goods Act 1957 shall be deemed to be compliance with the provisions of this section.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Hutt Valley Drainage Act 1967\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 July 2013, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][142] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][143] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][144] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][145] and [17E][146] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
