    *   (a) has no effect to the extent that it does so; but

#### Key terms defined

##### 8 Meaning of ordinary weekly pay

    *   (a) means the amount of pay that the employee receives under his or her employment agreement for an ordinary working week; and
    
    *   (b) includes---
            
        *   (i) productivity or incentive-based payments (including commission) if those payments are a regular part of the employee's pay:
        
        *   (ii) payments for overtime if those payments are a regular part of the employee's pay:
        
        *   (iii) the cash value of any board or lodgings provided by the employer to the employee; but
        
        
    
    *   (c) excludes---
            
        *   (i) productivity or incentive-based payments that are not a regular part of the employee's pay:
        
        *   (ii) payments for overtime that are not a regular part of the employee's pay:

        *   (iv) any discretionary payments that the employer is not bound, under the terms of the employee's employment agreement, to pay the employee:
        
        *   (v) any payment of any employer contribution to a superannuation scheme for the benefit of the employee.
        
        
    
    (2) If it is not possible to determine an employee's ordinary weekly pay under subsection (1), the pay must be calculated in accordance with the following formula:
    
    _a − b_ 
    
    c 
    
    where---
    
    **a**
    > 
    > is the employee's gross earnings for---
    >     
    > *   (i) the 4 calendar weeks before the end of the pay period immediately before the calculation is made; or
    > 
    > *   (ii) if, the employee's normal pay period is longer than 4 weeks, that pay period immediately before the calculation is made
    > 
    > 
    
    **b**
    > 
    > is the total amount of payments described in subsection (1)(c)(i) to (iii)
    
    **c**
    > 
    > is 4\.
    
    (3) However, an employment agreement may specify a special rate of ordinary weekly pay for the purpose of calculating annual holiday pay if the rate is equal to, or greater than, what would otherwise be calculated under subsection (1) or subsection (2).
    
    Compare: 1981 No 15 s 4
    
    Section 8(1)(c)(iv): amended (with effect on 17 May 2007), on 19 December 2007, by [section 119][143] of the Taxation (KiwiSaver) Act 2007 (2007 No 110).
    
    Section 8(1)(c)(v): added (with effect on 17 May 2007), on 19 December 2007, by [section 119][143] of the Taxation (KiwiSaver) Act 2007 (2007 No 110).

##### 9 Meaning of relevant daily pay
    
*   (1) In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, _relevant daily pay_, for the purposes of calculating payment for a public holiday, an alternative holiday, sick leave, or bereavement leave,---
        
    *   (a) means the amount of pay that the employee would have received had the employee worked on the day concerned; and 
    
    *   (b) includes---
            
        *   (i) productivity or incentive-based payments (including commission) if those payments would have otherwise been received had the employee worked on the day concerned:
        
        *   (ii) payments for overtime if those payments would have otherwise been received had the employee worked on the day concerned:
        
        *   (iii) the cash value of any board or lodgings provided by the employer to the employee; but
        
        
    
    *   (c) excludes any payment of any employer contribution to a superannuation scheme for the benefit of the employee.
    
    (2) However, an employment agreement may specify a special rate of relevant daily pay for the purpose of calculating payment for a public holiday, an alternative holiday, sick leave, or bereavement leave if the rate is equal to, or greater than, the rate that would otherwise be calculated under subsection (1).
    
    (3) To avoid doubt, if subsection (1)(a) is to be applied in the case of a public holiday, the amount of pay does not include any amount that would be added by virtue of [section 50(1)(a)][74] (which relates to the requirement to pay time and a half).
    
    Section 9: substituted, on 1 April 2011, by [section 5][144] of the Holidays Amendment Act 2010 (2010 No 126).

##### 9A Average daily pay

    *   (b) one or both of those days are specified in [section 44(1)][63].

    *   (a) that part of one or both days specified in [section 44(1)][63] is to be treated as not part of a public holiday; and
    
    *   (b) that,---
            
        *   (i) if the agreement relates to only 1 day specified in [section 44(1)][63], a period of 24 hours is to be treated as a public holiday if the period---
                
            *   (A) is to start or finish during the day specified in [section 44(1)][63]; and

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Holidays Act 2003\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 April 2011, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][206] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][207] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][208] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][209] and [17E][210] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
