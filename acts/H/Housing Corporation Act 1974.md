    (4) Notwithstanding such forfeiture, cancellation, or surrender, the mortgage to the Corporation shall, by virtue of this section, be deemed to be a first charge on the improvements then existing on the land for all money payable in respect thereof by any incoming tenant or occupier of the land (to the extent to which the mortgagor would have had interest therein if his title to the land had been lawfully determined otherwise than by forfeiture, cancellation, or surrender), and such money shall be paid to the Corporation accordingly:

    provided that, in the case of any land administered by the Land Settlement Board, the grant of a lease by the Corporation shall be subject to the approval of the Minister of Lands and in the case of any land administered by the Māori Trustee the grant of a lease by the Corporation shall be subject to the approval of the Minister of Maori Affairs.
    
    (7) Where the Corporation as mortgagee in possession of any land grants a lease or other tenancy of the land in accordance with subsection (6), the rent received by the Corporation shall be apportioned between the Corporation and the leasing authority in proportion to the values of the capital interests in the land of the Corporation and the leasing authority (as representing the Crown or other owner of the land) or in such other proportions as may be mutually agreed to between the Corporation and the leasing authority. Any rent or other revenue that may be received by the leasing authority in respect of a temporary lease or licence granted after the cancellation, forfeiture, or surrender of the mortgagor's title shall be similarly apportioned between the leasing authority and the Corporation.
    
    (8) If the Corporation sells the security in exercise of its powers of sale, any restrictions imposed by any Act on the right of lessee or licensee to mortgage or assign his interest in the land shall not apply with respect to the sale to the purchaser, nor shall any such restrictions apply with respect to the mortgage by the purchaser of his estate or interest in the land to the Corporation to secure the whole or any part of the purchase money.
    
    (9) Any sale by the Corporation in the exercise of its powers of sale may be by public auction or private contract, as the Corporation in its discretion thinks fit, and in the case of sale by private contract advertising shall not be necessary:
    
    provided that in the case of any land administered by the Land Settlement Board the sale shall be subject to the approval of the Minister of Lands.
    
    (10) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other Act, the power of sale shall be deemed to arise and accrue and may, without the consent of the leasing authority, be exercised by the Corporation at any time after the expiration of the period limited in that behalf by the mortgage.
