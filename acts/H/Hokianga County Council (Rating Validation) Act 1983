Whangape, Motukaraka, Kohukohu, Horeke, Omapere, Rawene, and Taheke: And whereas Resolution No 1 was invalid by virtue of the fact that the said works and services uniform annual charge was not intended to apply to the Rawene Community Council area, the Kohukohu Community Council area, and the Omapere and Opononi Community Council area, but those areas were not specifically excluded: And whereas Resolution No 1 was further invalid by virtue of the fact that the public notice of the intention to levy rates and the resolution making the said works and services uniform annual charge did not specify the function, work, or service for which the said charge was intended contrary to [sections 142][7] and [164A(1)][8] of the Local Government Act 1974: And whereas in reliance on Resolution No 1 the Council has made and levied the said works and services uniform annual charge throughout the county, except the Rawene Community Council area, the Kohukohu Community Council area, and the

$0.01965 in the dollar land value on all rateable property within the Rawene Community Council area: And whereas Resolution No 2 was invalid by virtue of the fact that the Council intended to make and

under [section 136][10] of that Act should not be made and levied on the rateable property within the community and that instead a community general rate should be made and levied on every rateable property within the community as required by the said section 139: And whereas Resolution No 2 was further invalid by virtue of the fact that the public notice of intention to levy rates, and Resolution No 2, did not specify that a community general rate was to be made and levied: And whereas in reliance on Resolution No 2, the Council has made and levied the said rate of $0.01965 in the dollar land value on all rateable property in the Rawene Community Council area for the rating year beginning on 1 April 1982: And whereas it is desirable that Resolution No 2 and the said rate be

not, by resolution, declare that the general rate under section 136 of that Act should not be made and levied on the rateable property within the community and that instead a community general rate should be made and levied on every rateable property within the community as required by the said section 139: And whereas Resolution No 3 was further invalid by virtue of the fact that the public notice of intention to levy rates, and Resolution No 3, did not specify that a community general rate was to be made and levied: And whereas in reliance on Resolution No 3, the Council has made and levied the said rate of $0.015724 in the dollar land value on all rateable property within the Omapere and Opononi Community Council area for the rating year beginning on 1 April 1982: And whereas it is desirable that Resolution No 3 and the said rate be validated: And whereas at an ordinary meeting held on 30 June 1982 the Council passed a resolution (hereinafter referred to as Resolution No 4)

Community Council area, excluding those commercial properties in code C as defined in a statement approved by the Council on 17 May 1982, and a differential general rate of $0.039825 in the dollar land value on the rateable value of all commercial properties within the boundary of the Kohukohu Community Council area as defined in a statement approved by the Council on 17 May 1982: And whereas

within the community and that instead differential community general rates should be made and levied on every rateable property within the community as required by the said section 139: And whereas

made and levied: And whereas in reliance on Resolution No 4 the Council has made and levied the said differential rate of $0.013275 in the dollar land value and $0.039825 in the dollar land value,

    *   (d) the general effect that the introduction of differential rating was expected to have on the incidence of rates as between ratepayers or groups of ratepayers within the district, ward, or special rating area, as the case may be---
    
    as prescribed by [section 147A(1)(c)][11] of the Local Government Act 1974: And whereas that special order was further invalid by virtue of the fact that the statement made available for public inspection pursuant to section 147A(1)(d) of the Local Government Act 1974 did not contain the particulars required by section 147A(1)(c) of that Act: And whereas in reliance on that special order the Council has made and levied certain rates for the rating year beginning on 1 April 1982: And whereas it is desirable that the said special order, and the said rates, be validated.

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][13] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][15] and [17E][16] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
