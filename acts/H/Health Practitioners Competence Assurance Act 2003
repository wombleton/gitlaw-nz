        *   (v) setting programmes to ensure the ongoing competence of health practitioners:
        
        
    
    *   (c) provide for the membership of authorities:
    
    *   (d) confer certain powers on the Minister in relation to authorities:
    
    *   (e) require authorities to maintain public registers of health practitioners.
    
    (7) [Part 7][179] contains (in [subpart 1][180]) miscellaneous provisions, including provisions of general application (such as, for example, a provision on the way notice is to be given under the Act), consequential amendments, repeals, savings, and (in [subpart 2][210]) transitional provisions, including provisions for the continued recognition of the registration of health practitioners who were, immediately before the expiry of 1 year beginning on the date on which this Act received the Royal assent, registered under a health-registration statute.

    (4) Any delegation under this clause may be revoked at any time, and the delegation of a function, duty, or power does not prevent the Registrar from personally performing or exercising the function, duty, or power.
    
    (5) Every delegate purporting to act under a delegation under this clause is, until the contrary is proved, presumed to be acting in accordance with the terms of the delegation.

##### 22 Presumptions and savings of certain transactions
    
*   (1) The validity or enforceability of any deed, agreement, right, or obligation entered into, conferred on, or incurred by an authority is not affected by a failure of the authority to comply with any provision of this Act.
    
    (2) A person purporting to execute any documentation on behalf of an authority in accordance with a direction of, or a delegation given by, the authority is, in the absence of proof to the contrary, presumed to be acting in accordance with that direction or delegation.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 October 2012, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][472] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][473] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][474] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][475] and [17E][476] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
