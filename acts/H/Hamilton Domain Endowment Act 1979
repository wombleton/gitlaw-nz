    (2) The land described in [Schedule 3][15] is hereby vested in the Council for the purposes of this Act in all cases subject to all leases, encumbrances, liens, or easements to which it is subject at the commencement of this Act, but otherwise freed and discharged from all trusts and reservations affecting the same.
    
    (3) The said land shall not be subject to the provisions of the Hamilton Domains Act 1911, but nothing in this Act shall affect the leases or the rights of lessees in leases issued under that Act.

##### 4 Land to be held for endowment for a reserve

    provided that simultaneously such lessee at his own cost and to the satisfaction of the Council arranges for the registration of the effective merger of his leasehold interest in such fee simple or otherwise for the effective extinguishment of his leasehold interest:
    
    provided also that the provisions of this section shall not apply to the land described in [Part 2][22] of Schedule 2 of this Act, the same having been acquired pursuant to section 6(c) of the Hamilton Domain Endowment Act 1971\.
    
    (2) Any such sale shall be on the basis of the current land value of the land, as determined by the Council after obtaining a valuation from a registered valuer for that purpose or as fixed by arbitration in the manner provided for in the Arbitration Act 1908, together with---
        
    *   (a) the value as determined by the Council of any improvements on the said land effected by the Corporation or by the Council or by any previous proprietor of the fee simple and not previously purchased by the lessee or any previous lessee; and
    
    *   (b) all valuation, survey, and other expenses of the Council relating to the fixation of the sale price and the sale and transfer of the fee simple to the lessee:
        
        provided that, where the lessee elects to have the value fixed by arbitration, then, notwithstanding any of the provisions of the Arbitration Act 1908 (including Schedule 2 thereto), all costs of the reference and award including arbitrators' and umpires' fees and charges shall be paid by the lessee.
    
    (3) On the completion of any sale and transfer the land affected thereby shall be freed from the trusts imposed by [sections 3][4] and [4][5].
    
    (4) In subsection (2) the terms **improvements** and **land value** shall have the same meanings as those contained in section 2 of the Valuation of Land Act 1951 save that in determining land value no reduction shall be made as a result of the existence of the lease to the purchaser at the time of sale and transfer.
    
    (5) Where the fee simple estate in the land is sold to the lessee under the provisions of this section, the Council at its own discretion may, subject to subsections (6) to (8), accept in lieu of a total cash payment a registerable mortgage of the said estate securing to the Council not more than 90% of the total amount payable by the lessee under subsection (2), but excluding therefrom the sums referred to in subsection (2)(b) (the amount secured being hereinafter referred to as the _principal sum_).
    
    (6) Where the mortgagor under a mortgage that is accepted under subsection (5) is a community organisation, the following provisions shall apply---
        
    *   (a) the Council at its own discretion may accept as security for the principal sum either a registerable first mortgage of the said estate or alternatively a registerable second mortgage of the said estate guaranteed by an approved guarantor:
    
    *   (b) the principal sum and all other money secured to the Council by the terms of any mortgage accepted by it shall at the option of the Council become due and payable and may forthwith be called up if during the term thereof the use of the said land is changed without the consent of the Council given in its capacity as mortgagee:
    
    *   (c) any mortgage accepted by the Council shall otherwise be subject to such terms and conditions as may appear to the Council to be appropriate.
    
    (7) Where the land mortgaged under a mortgage that is accepted under subsection (5) is land which, at the time of both the sale and transfer of the land to the mortgagor, is zoned by the Council as Residential I or Residential II or Residential III under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1977 and in the opinion of the Council (whose decision shall be final) 1 (but not more than 1) self-contained home or residence for the purposes of a single house-keeping unit to be used by the transferee is either then erected upon the said land or is likely to be erected thereon within 2 years after the date of the completion of the sale, the following provisions shall apply:
        
    *   (a) the Council at its own discretion may accept as security for the principal sum either a registerable first mortgage of the said estate or alternatively a registerable second mortgage of the said estate guaranteed by an approved guarantor:
    
    *   (b) the principal sum and all other money secured to the Council by the terms of any mortgage accepted by it shall at the option of the Council become due and payable and may forthwith be called up if---
            
        *   (i) any self-contained home or residence for the purpose of a single house-keeping unit that the mortgagor covenants as a term of the mortgage to have erected upon the mortgaged land is not so erected within the prescribed time; or
        
        *   (ii) during the term thereof more than 1 self-contained home or residence for the purposes of a single house-keeping unit is erected upon the mortgaged land; or
        
        *   (iii) during the term thereof the one self-contained home or residence for the purposes of a single house-keeping unit erected upon the mortgaged land is not occupied as owner by the mortgagor or by the spouse or former spouse of the mortgagor:
        
        
    
    *   (c) any mortgage accepted by the Council shall otherwise be subject to such terms and conditions as may appear to the Council to be appropriate.
    
    (8) In every other case where a mortgage is accepted under subsection (5), that mortgage shall be a registerable first mortgage of the fee simple estate.
    
    (9) Except as provided in subsections (5) to (8), any mortgage accepted by the Council shall be subject to such terms and conditions as may appear to the Council to be appropriate:
    
    provided that---
        
    *   (a) where the mortgagor is not a community organisation and the land mortgaged is zoned by the Council as Residential II or Residential III under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1977, the rate of interest payable shall, while not more than 1 self-contained home or residence for the purposes of a single house-keeping unit is erected upon the mortgaged land and is occupied by the mortgagor or by the spouse or former spouse of the mortgagor, be not more than 0.5% per annum more than the rate of interest that would have been payable if subsection (7) had been applicable; and
    
    *   (b) where the mortgagor is a community organisation, the rate of interest payable shall be the same as the rate of interest that would have been payable if subsection (7) had been applicable.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Hamilton Domain Endowment Act 1979\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 26 August 1981, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][28] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][29] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][30] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][31] and [17E][32] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
