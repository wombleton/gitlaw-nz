##### 5 Constitution of court
    
*   (1) The court shall consist of 3 members---namely, a President and 2 nominated members.
    
    (2) The President of the court from time to time shall be the Chief Justice of New Zealand, or such present or past Judge of the Supreme Court of New Zealand as the Chief Justice from time to time assigns to the position of President.
    
    (3) The nominated members of the court shall be fit persons appointed for that purpose from time to time by the Governor-General.

##### 6 Reserve nominated members

    (2) If at any time a vacancy exists in the office of nominated member of the court, or if any nominated member is not present at any sitting of the court, the President may summon any reserve nominated member to attend the sittings of the court and to act as a nominated member thereof, and while so acting such reserve nominated member shall have and may exercise all the powers, functions, and privileges, and shall perform all the duties, of the nominated member for whom he is acting.

##### 7 Oath of office and secrecy
    
*   Before entering on the exercise of the functions of their office, the nominated members of the court shall make oath or affirmation before the President that they will faithfully and impartially perform the duties of their office, and also that, except in the discharge of their duties, they will not disclose to any person any evidence or other matter brought before the court or any of the deliberations of the court.

##### 8 Constitution of court not to be questioned
    
*   (1) The appointment of the President, or of a nominated member, or of a reserve nominated member of the court shall not be questioned on any ground whatsoever; and no act done by the court sitting with a reserve nominated member, or done by such reserve nominated member, shall be questioned on the ground that the occasion for such reserve nominated member acting as a member of the court had not arisen or had ceased.
    
    (2) Whether the court at any sitting thereof is duly constituted as required by the provisions of this Act, or has been duly convened for such sitting, are matters to be determined by the President, whose decision thereon shall be final and conclusive, and shall not be questioned in any proceedings in the court or in any other court.
    
    (3) The fact that a sitting of the court has been held shall be conclusive evidence of a decision by the President that the court was duly constituted at and duly convened for that sitting.

##### 9 Registrar, Deputy Registrars, and other officers of court
    
*   (1) There shall be a Registrar of the court, who shall keep the records of the court and shall perform all such administrative duties in respect of the court as the President may from time to time direct.
    
    (2) There may be appointed such Deputy Registrars of the court as may be deemed necessary, who shall, subject to the control of the Registrar, possess, exercise, and perform the same powers, functions, and duties as the Registrar; and every reference in this Act to the Registrar of the court shall, so far as applicable, extend and apply to a Deputy Registrar accordingly.

    (2) Judicial notice shall be taken of the seal of the court by all courts and for all purposes.

##### 11 Records of the court
    
*   The Registrar of the court shall keep proper books in which shall be entered minutes of all proceedings in the court.

#### Jurisdiction and procedure of the court

##### 12 Declaratory orders as to rights or liabilities
    
*   Where any person claims---
        
    *   (a) that he is entitled to or interested in any right of personal status, or any right in respect of property, or any personal right, or any other right, and that the establishment of such right has been or may be rendered difficult or impossible by reason of the loss or destruction of any document, or by reason of any other matter, arising out of the earthquake; or
    
    *   (b) that he is or may be under any liability, or that any property to which he is entitled or in which he is interested is or may be subject to any liability, and that the determination of questions as to the existence or extent of such liability has been or may be rendered difficult or impossible by reason of any such loss, destruction, or other matter---
    
    such person may apply to the court for an order determining any question as to the existence of such right or liability, and declaring the terms thereof, and ordering that notwithstanding such loss, destruction, or other matter the applicant shall enjoy the same rights or be subject to the same liabilities as if such loss, destruction, or other matter had not occurred, or making such particular order as may appear to the court to be adequate to place the applicant in the same position as nearly as may be as he would have been in if such loss, destruction, or other matter had not occurred.

##### 13 Nature of declaratory orders
    
*   (1) In any case where the court is exercising only the jurisdiction conferred by the last preceding section, and is not exercising any other jurisdiction conferred by this Act, the court shall as far as possible restrict itself to decisions in reinstatement of the previously existing rights and liabilities of the parties without adjudicating upon any question consequentially arising out of such rights or liabilities; but no objection shall be taken to any order of the court upon the ground that any further or other adjudication or decision affecting the rights and liabilities of the parties is expressed or implied therein.
    
    (2) The jurisdiction hereby conferred upon the court to make a declaratory order shall be discretionary, and the court may, on any grounds which it deems sufficient, refuse to make any such order.

##### 14 Rehearings of applications for declaratory orders
    
*   The court may at any time, on the application of any person affected, and upon such terms and conditions as it thinks fit, grant a rehearing of any application for an order under [section 12][16] on the ground that documentary evidence has been discovered since the original hearing which was in existence on 3 February 1931 but which was believed at the time of the original hearing to have been lost or destroyed by reason of the earthquake.

##### 15 Applications to court for relief from obligations or encumbrances
    
*   (1) Where any person claims---
        
    *   (a) that he was on 3 February 1931 and at the time of the application still is subject to any obligation wholly or partly pecuniary in its nature, whether absolute or contingent, and whether accrued or accruing; or
    
    *   (b) that any property to which he is entitled or in which he is interested was on 3 February 1931 and at the time of the application still is subject to any liability, mortgage, lien, liability for distress or execution, charge, or encumbrance of any kind, wholly or partly pecuniary in its nature (all hereinafter included in the term **encumbrance**); and
    
    *   (c) in either of the above cases, that by reason of any matter arising out of the earthquake he would suffer undue hardship if he were required to comply with or continue to be bound by such obligation, or if such property continued to be subject to such encumbrance---
    
    such person may apply to the court for relief from such obligation or encumbrance.
    
    (2) The court may entertain any such application notwithstanding that any person other than the applicant is or may be also liable under such obligation or encumbrance, or that any person entitled to the benefit of the encumbrance has or may have recourse to other property in addition to that to which the applicant is entitled or in which he is interested.

##### 16 Orders for relief
    
*   (1) Upon any application under the last preceding section the court may make such order as it deems just and equitable under the circumstances of the case. In particular, without limiting the generality of the foregoing provision, the court may have regard to the loss suffered as a result of the earthquake by each party affected by the application, the relative positions (financial and otherwise) of such parties, the degree to which the granting of any relief would be reasonably likely to be of permanent benefit to the applicant (considering his circumstances, and particularly his assets and his other liabilities, if any), and any other relevant considerations.
    
    (2) Any order made under this section may discharge an obligation or encumbrance wholly or in part, or extend the time allowed for the discharge thereof, or vary or amend any of the terms thereof or incidents attending the same, in such manner, and subject to such terms and conditions, as the court may think fit.

##### 17 Certain powers of execution, etc, not to be exercised while proceedings pending in court, except with leave of court
    
*   (1) While any proceedings are pending in the court relating to any person or property, it shall not be lawful with respect to such person or property, except with the leave of the court granted upon such terms and conditions as the court thinks fit, to do any of the acts defined in the next succeeding subsection, or to continue or complete the doing of any such act, whether commenced before or after the passing of this Act or before or after the commencement of such proceedings.
    
    (2) The acts referred to in the last preceding subsection are the following:
        
    *   (a) to issue any process of execution in pursuance of any judgment, decree, or order of any court in its civil jurisdiction obtained (whether before or after the passing of this Act) in respect of any liability incurred on or before 3 February 1931 or in pursuance of any order made under the Destitute Persons Act 1910 on or before the said date:
    
    *   (b) to seize or sell any property by way of distress for rent due on or before 3 February 1931:
    
    *   (c) to exercise any power of sale conferred by any mortgage, bill of sale, debenture, debenture trust deed, or other security given on or before 3 February 1931:
    
    *   (d) to exercise any power of re-entry or retaking possession of chattels conferred by any lease or bailment granted before 3 February 1931:
    
    *   (e) to exercise any power of rescission in respect of any contract made before 3 February 1931:
    
    *   (f) to file a creditor's petition in bankruptcy, or, in the case of a company, a petition for its winding-up by the Supreme Court.

    (2) In the course of the proceedings on any application the court may, subject to rules of court, without further application and upon such terms as to notice to parties and otherwise as the court thinks fit, proceed to exercise any other part of its jurisdiction the exercise of which in that proceeding the court deems necessary or advisable.

    *   (b) with the consent of the parties, in any proceeding.
    
    (2) The decision of a majority (including the President) of the members present at the sitting of the court, or, if the members present are equally divided in opinion, then the decision of the President, shall be the decision of the court.

    (2) Subject to the foregoing provisions of this section, the [Evidence Act 2006][79] shall apply to the court and to the members thereof, and to all proceedings therein, in the same manner as if the court were a court within the meaning of that Act.
    
    Section 23(2): amended, on 1 August 2007, by [section 216][80] of the Evidence Act 2006 (2006 No 69).

##### 24 Proceedings may be heard in camera

##### 25 No fees payable
    
*   (1) No fee shall be received or demanded in respect of any matter or proceeding in the court.
    
    (2) Unless the court otherwise orders, no costs shall be awarded to any party in any proceeding in the court, but the court shall have power if it thinks fit, on account of the relative positions of the parties, or if it considers any act on the part of a party to have been unconscionable or in the circumstances improper, or for any other reason, to order that a sum by way of costs (not exceeding in any case the sum that might have been awarded as costs if the proceedings had been an action in the Supreme Court) be paid by any party to any other party.

#### Miscellaneous

##### 27 Proceedings may in certain cases be referred by court to Magistrate or other person
    
*   (1) Any proceeding in the court may be referred by the court, if it thinks fit,---
        
    *   (a) with or without application by or hearing any party, to a Magistrate to be specified by the court; or

##### 29 Registration of orders affecting interests in land
    
*   (1) Any order of the court affecting or relating to any estate, right, or interest in land may, if the court so orders, or if the rules of the court so provide, be registered against the title to that land either under the Land Transfer Act 1915, or the [Deeds Registration Act 1908][81], as the case may be.
    
    (2) For the purposes of such registration a copy of the order, under the seal of the court, shall be transmitted by the Registrar of the court to the District Land Registrar or the Registrar of Deeds, as the case may be; and the said District Land Registrar or Registrar of Deeds shall thereupon register it accordingly without fee. Unless the court otherwise orders, or the rules of the court otherwise provide, the production of the certificate of title shall not be necessary for the purpose of any such registration under the Land Transfer Act 1915\.

##### 33 Contempt of court
    
*   (1) If any person wilfully insults any member of the court, or the Registrar, or any Deputy Registrar or other officer of the court, during his sitting or attendance in court, or while he is going to or returning from the court, or a witness in court, or wilfully interrupts the proceedings of the court, or without good cause refuses to give evidence, or is guilty in any other manner of any wilful contempt at any sitting of the court, it shall be lawful for a constable or any officer of the court, with or without the assistance of any other person, to take the person so offending into custody and remove him from the precincts of the court, to be detained in custody until the rising of the court.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Hawke's Bay Earthquake Act 1931\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 August 2007, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][90] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][91] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][92] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][93] and [17E][94] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
