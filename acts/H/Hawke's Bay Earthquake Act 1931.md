##### 12 Declaratory orders as to rights or liabilities
    
*   Where any person claims---
        
    *   (a) That he is entitled to or interested in any right of personal status, or any right in respect of property, or any personal right, or any other right, and that the establishment of such right has been or may be rendered difficult or impossible by reason of the loss or destruction of any document, or by reason of any other matter, arising out of the earthquake; or
    
    *   (b) That he is or may be under any liability, or that any property to which he is entitled or in which he is interested is or may be subject to any liability, and that the determination of questions as to the existence or extent of such liability has been or may be rendered difficult or impossible by reason of any such loss, destruction, or other matter---
    
    such person may apply to the Court for an order determining any question as to the existence of such right or liability, and declaring the terms thereof, and ordering that notwithstanding such loss, destruction, or other matter the applicant shall enjoy the same rights or be subject to the same liabilities as if such loss, destruction, or other matter had not occurred, or making such particular order as may appear to the Court to be adequate to place the applicant in the same position as nearly as may be as he would have been in if such loss, destruction, or other matter had not occurred.

##### 13 Nature of declaratory orders
    
*   (1) In any case where the Court is exercising only the jurisdiction conferred by the last preceding section, and is not exercising any other jurisdiction conferred by this Act, the Court shall as far as possible restrict itself to decisions in reinstatement of the previously existing rights and liabilities of the parties without adjudicating upon any question consequentially arising out of such rights or liabilities; but no objection shall be taken to any order of the Court upon the ground that any further or other adjudication or decision affecting the rights and liabilities of the parties is expressed or implied therein.
    
    (2) The jurisdiction hereby conferred upon the Court to make a declaratory order shall be discretionary, and the Court may, on any grounds which it deems sufficient, refuse to make any such order.

##### 14 Rehearings of applications for declaratory orders
    
*   The Court may at any time, on the application of any person affected, and upon such terms and conditions as it thinks fit, grant a rehearing of any application for an order under section twelve hereof on the ground that documentary evidence has been discovered since the original hearing which was in existence on the third day of February, nineteen hundred and thirty-one, but which was believed at the time of the original hearing to have been lost or destroyed by reason of the earthquake.

##### 15 Applications to Court for relief from obligations or encumbrances
    
*   (1) Where any person claims---
        
    *   (a) That he was on the third day of February, nineteen hundred and thirty-one, and at the time of the application still is subject to any obligation wholly or partly pecuniary in its nature, whether absolute or contingent, and whether accrued or accruing; or
    
    *   (b) That any property to which he is entitled or in which he is interested was on the said third day of February, nineteen hundred and thirty-one, and at the time of the application still is subject to any liability, mortgage, lien, liability for distress or execution, charge, or encumbrance of any kind, wholly or partly pecuniary in its nature (all hereinafter included in the term **encumbrance**); and
    
    *   (c) In either of the above cases, that by reason of any matter arising out of the earthquake he would suffer undue hardship if he were required to comply with or continue to be bound by such obligation, or if such property continued to be subject to such encumbrance---
    
    such person may apply to the Court for relief from such obligation or encumbrance.
    
    (2) The Court may entertain any such application notwithstanding that any person other than the applicant is or may be also liable under such obligation or encumbrance, or that any person entitled to the benefit of the encumbrance has or may have recourse to other property in addition to that to which the applicant is entitled or in which he is interested.

##### 16 Orders for relief
    
*   (1) Upon any application under the last preceding section the Court may make such order as it deems just and equitable under the circumstances of the case. In particular, without limiting the generality of the foregoing provision, the Court may have regard to the loss suffered as a result of the earthquake by each party affected by the application, the relative positions (financial and otherwise) of such parties, the degree to which the granting of any relief would be reasonably likely to be of permanent benefit to the applicant (considering his circumstances, and particularly his assets and his other liabilities, if any), and any other relevant considerations.
    
    (2) Any order made under this section may discharge an obligation or encumbrance wholly or in part, or extend the time allowed for the discharge thereof, or vary or amend any of the terms thereof or incidents attending the same, in such manner, and subject to such terms and conditions, as the Court may think fit.

##### 17 Certain powers of execution, etc, not to be exercised while proceedings pending in Court, except with leave of Court
    
*   (1) While any proceedings are pending in the Court relating to any person or property, it shall not be lawful with respect to such person or property, except with the leave of the Court granted upon such terms and conditions as the Court thinks fit, to do any of the acts defined in the next succeeding subsection, or to continue or complete the doing of any such act, whether commenced before or after the passing of this Act or before or after the commencement of such proceedings.
    
    (2) The acts referred to in the last preceding subsection are the following:---

    (2) Subject to the foregoing provisions of this section, the [Evidence Act 2006][78], shall apply to the Court and to the members thereof, and to all proceedings therein, in the same manner as if the Court were a Court within the meaning of that Act.

#### Miscellaneous

##### 26 Power to stay proceedings in other Courts pending proceedings in High Court

    (6) Any order or determination made by a District Court Judge or other person under this section shall be under the hand of such District Court Judge or other person, and such District Court Judge or other person shall forthwith transmit such order or determination to the Registrar of the Court, who shall cause it to be filed in the proper register of the Court, whereupon, subject to the provisions of subsection [four][31] hereof, it shall have effect according to its tenor as if it were an order of the Court.
