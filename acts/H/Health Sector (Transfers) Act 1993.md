    (2) Where any rights and obligations of a transferor under a contract of service arise by virtue of a collective employment contract and such rights and obligations are transferred to a transferee under [section 4][8] or [section 5][9], that collective employment contract shall be deemed, as from the commencement of the transfer date (or such other time as is specified in the agreement, proposal, or Order in Council), to continue to apply on the same terms (including any terms relating to new employees) as if it were a contract made between the transferee, any bargaining agent that is a party to it, and the employee.

*   (1) Where an employee of a transferor receives a reasonable offer of employment from any transferee on or before the date on which the employee ceases to be employed by the transferor, being an offer of employment on terms and conditions that are substantially similar to the terms and conditions applying to the employee at the date on which the employee ceases to be employed by the transferor, then, except as otherwise determined by the Minister but notwithstanding the terms of that employee's contract of service with the transferor, the employee shall not be entitled to receive any payment or other benefit from the transferor by reason of so ceasing, whether or not the employee accepts that offer of employment from the transferee.
    
    (2) Where an employee of a transferor ceases for any reason (including redundancy) to be an employee of the transferor but is employed (in any capacity) by a transferee within 9 months of so ceasing (whether or not that employment with the transferee commenced before the employee ceased employment with the transferor), then, notwithstanding the terms of that employee's contract of service with the transferor,---

    (4) Every amount payable by an employee under subsection (2)(b) shall constitute a debt due from the employee to the person who paid it (or, if that person was an area health board, to the Crown Health Financing Agency) and may be recovered accordingly.
    
    (5) The Minister may vary a scale in respect of a particular employee where the Minister is satisfied that---
        
    *   (a) undue hardship to the employee would otherwise result; or
    
    *   (b) it is reasonable to do so having regard to the extent to which the employee's terms and conditions of employment with the transferee differ from those with the transferor.
    
    (6) This section shall apply only to those employees who cease to be employed by a transferor on or before 31 December 1994\.

    the transferee shall on and from that date be obliged to contribute to that scheme in respect of that employee in accordance with the terms of the scheme and shall be deemed to be a local authority for the purposes of [section 40][105] of the National Provident Fund Restructuring Act 1990\.

    (2) Subject to the [Government Superannuation Fund Act 1956][106], nothing in subsection (1) shall entitle any such person to become a contributor to the Government Superannuation Fund after that person has ceased to be a contributor.

## Schedule 1  
Provisions relating to transfer of assets and liabilities

[ss 9][13], [22(4)][38]

##### 1 Assets relating to land may be transferred separately
    
*   Assets that have been fixed to, or placed under or over, any land may be transferred to a transferee under this Act notwithstanding that no interest in the land is also transferred to the transferee under this Act, and in any such case---
        
    *   (a) the assets and the land shall be regarded as separate assets each capable of separate ownership; and
    
    *   (b) the assets shall, for the purposes of this Act and of every other enactment or rule of law, be treated as personal property, and not as land or an interest in land, notwithstanding that they are so affixed to, or under or over, land.
    
    

##### 2 Transfer of assets where certain terms and conditions prescribed by statute
    
*   (1) Where---
        
    *   (a) rights or obligations to provide goods or services to third parties are transferred to a transferee under this Act; and
    
    *   (b) those goods or services have previously been provided by a transferor on terms and conditions wholly or partly prescribed by any Act; and
    
    *   (c) the Governor-General has by Order in Council declared that this subclause shall apply in respect of those goods or services,---
    
    the goods or services shall, to the extent that those terms and conditions are not already contained in contracts between the transferor and third parties, from the date of transfer be deemed to be provided pursuant to contracts between the transferee and the third parties (whether or not the Act is repealed).
    
    (2) Each such contract shall be deemed to include such of the terms and conditions contained in that Act (with all necessary modifications) as are specified in the Order in Council.
    
    (3) Where any land that is subject to any lease, licence, permit, or right, created on terms and conditions wholly or partly set out in any Act has been or is to be transferred to a transferee under this Act, the Governor-General may, by Order in Council, declare that such of the provisions of that Act as are specified in the order shall continue to apply in relation to the land and such licence, lease, permit, or right.
    
    (4) Where an Order in Council is made under subclause (3), the provisions of the Act referred to in the order shall, with all necessary modifications, continue to apply in relation to the land and the terms or conditions of the lease, licence, permit, or right subject to any agreement to---
        
    *   (a) amend or revoke any such term or condition; or
    
    *   (b) revoke any such term or condition, and substitute another term or condition for it---
    
    made between the owner for the time being of the land and the holder for the time being of the lease, licence, permit, or right.

##### 3 Modification of provisions of Public Works Act 1981
    
*   (1) In this clause, _public work land_ means any land or interest in land owned by a transferee that---

    *   (b) has on 1 or more occasions been transferred by or under this Act.
    
    (2) [Sections 40 to 42][119] of the Public Works Act 1981 do not apply to any public work land so long as the land---
        
    *   (a) is held by a transferee (regardless of whether or not those purposes are the purposes for which the land was acquired under the [Public Works Act 1981][120] or under any corresponding former Act)---
            
        *   (i) for the purposes of the transferee; or
        
        *   (ii) to enable the transferee to prepare for the disposal of the land; or
        
        *   (iii) to enable the transferee to determine whether to transfer or hold the land for any purpose referred to in this subclause; or
        
        
    
    *   (b) is transferred under this Act to enable another transferee to hold the land for any of the purposes specified in paragraph (a); or
    
    *   (c) is held under a lease or licence granted by a transferee to any person other than a transferee for health-related purposes or, with the consent of the Minister, for any other purpose.
    
    (3) If any public work land is not held or transferred in accordance with subclause (2), [sections 40][119] and [41][121] of the Public Works Act 1981 apply as if the land were owned by the Crown. However, the proceeds of any sale of the land must nevertheless be applied for the purposes of the transferee that, immediately before the sale, owned the land.
    
    (4) When subclause (3) applies to any public work land, the transferee that owns the land may, subject to subclause (5), sell or otherwise dispose of the land to any person on any terms or conditions it thinks fit if,---
        
    *   (a) within 40 working days following an offer made, under [section 40(2)][119] of the Public Works Act 1981 (or such further period as the transferee allows), the parties have neither agreed on a price for the land nor agreed that the price be determined by the Land Valuation Tribunal; or
    
    *   (b) an offer under [section 40][119] of that Act in respect of the land is not required.
    
    (5) A transferee and a person who is entitled, or may become entitled, to receive an offer under [section 40(2)][119] of the Public Works Act 1981 in respect of any public work land may agree that the sale of the land is to be subject to any terms and conditions, including, for example, a term or condition entitling the transferee to lease the land.
    
    (6) An agreement under subclause (5), in relation to any public work land with a person who is entitled, or may become entitled, to receive an offer under [section 40(2)][119] of the Public Works Act 1981 in respect of that land, extinguishes the person's entitlement or prospective entitlement under that section in respect of the land.
    
    Schedule 1 clause 3: substituted, on 1 January 2001, by [section 12][122] of the Health Sector (Transfers) Amendment Act 2000 (2000 No 92).

    (2) For the purposes of this clause, the rights of persons to have land or an interest in land offered to them under [section 40(2)][119] of the Public Works Act 1981 shall be deemed to be interests in land for the purposes of [section 137][123] of the Land Transfer Act 1952\.
    
    (3) In stating, in a caveat lodged under subclause (1), the interest claimed by the caveator, it shall be sufficient, for the purposes of [section 138][124] of the Land Transfer Act 1952, to refer to [sections 40 to 42][119] of the Public Works Act 1981 and to this clause.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Health Sector (Transfers) Act 1993\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 July 2012, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][165] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][166] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][1] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][167] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][1] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][168] and [17E][169] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][1] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][1] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   ‚Ä¢omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   ‚Ä¢typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   ‚Ä¢layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   ‚Ä¢indentation
        *   ‚Ä¢position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   ‚Ä¢format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   ‚Ä¢format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   ‚Ä¢position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   ‚Ä¢punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   ‚Ä¢Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   ‚Ä¢case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   ‚Ä¢format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   ‚Ä¢small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   ‚Ä¢schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   ‚Ä¢running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   ‚Ä¢format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
