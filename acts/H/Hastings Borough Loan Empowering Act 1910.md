it was also stated in the said notice that it was proposed to pay out of the loan the cost of raising the same, and the interest on the loan for the first year: And whereas the said notice was published in the Hastings Standard newspaper---a newspaper circulating in the Borough of Hastings---on the twenty-second day of January, nineteen hundred and ten, the twenty-ninth day of January, nineteen hundred and ten, the fifth day of February, nineteen hundred and ten, and the twelfth day of February, nineteen hundred and ten: And whereas notice was given in accordance with section nine of the said Act on the twelfth day of February, nineteen hundred and ten, in the said Hastings Standard newspaper, that a meeting of ratepayers in the Borough of Hastings would be held at the Princess Theatre on the twenty-first day of February, nineteen hundred and ten, at eight o'clock in the evening, to consider the said proposal: And whereas at such last-mentioned meeting, pursuant to section ten of the said Act, a resolution was unanimously passed requesting the Chairman to cause a poll of ratepayers of the said borough to be taken upon the said proposal: And whereas, pursuant to section eleven of the said Act, the Chairman published a notice on the twenty-second day of February, nineteen hundred and ten, in the said Hastings Standard newspaper, that a poll of the ratepayers of the borough would be taken at Hastings on the second day of March, nineteen hundred and ten, upon the proposal of the Hastings Borough Council to borrow one hundred and seventy thousand dollars for the purposes hereinbefore mentioned: And whereas the said poll was duly taken on the said second day of March, nineteen hundred and ten, and at such poll the numbers of votes recorded were as follow---for the proposal, one thousand;
