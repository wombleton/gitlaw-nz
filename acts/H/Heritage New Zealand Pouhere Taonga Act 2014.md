    (2) Unless otherwise expressly provided for, this subpart applies instead of subpart 2 if an emergency authority is sought and granted within 12 months after a declaration is made under [section 72][187] of the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002 to terminate the emergency, or such further time as is reasonably necessary in the circumstances.

##### 61 Application for emergency authority
    
*   (1) Any person may apply to Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga for an emergency authority to undertake an activity that will or may modify or destroy an archaeological site or sites if, after a national or local emergency has been declared, it appears that it may be necessary to undertake an activity that will or may modify or destroy a site or sites.

    (3) Before Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga grants an emergency authority, it must be satisfied that any person who is to carry out an activity under the emergency authority, if granted, meets the requirements of [section 45(2)][61].
    
    (4) After having regard to all the circumstances, Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga, if it thinks that it is not necessary to use its emergency powers under this subpart, may decline to consider an application under this subpart, giving reasons for doing so, but determine it under [subpart 2][55].

##### 62 Determination of applications
    
*   (1) Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga may---
        
    *   (a) grant an emergency authority in whole or in part, with or without conditions; or

    *   (e) the views of the owner of the land, to the extent that they can reasonably be ascertained.
    
    (3) If an application made under this subpart relates to a site of interest to Māori,---
        
    *   (a) Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga must refer the application to the Council (unless there has been a delegation to the Council under [section 22][28]); and
    
    *   (b) the Council may consult as it thinks appropriate, but must make any recommendations to Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga not later than 3 days after the matter is referred to the Council.
    
    (4) In the case of an application that relates to a customary marine title area in respect of which a planning document has been lodged with Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga under [section 86(1)(b)][182] of the Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Act 2011, Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga must comply with [section 89(a)][184] of that Act.

    *   (e) the chief executive.
    
    (7) If Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga is unable to contact the owner of the relevant land through publicly available records within the time permitted by this section to obtain consent to carry out an activity, the lack of consent does not invalidate the determination of Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga.

##### 63 Condition requiring investigation
