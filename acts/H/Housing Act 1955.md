    (2) Any such agreement or licence may describe the land comprised therein by reference to the plan thereof held by the Corporation as well as by any other mode of description; and, where a copy of that plan is deposited in the Land Registry Office of the district where the land is situated or a plan of the land is endorsed on the agreement or licence, the District Land Registrar for that district shall register the agreement or licence notwithstanding that a plan of the land has not been deposited as required by the District Land Registrar under [section 167][71] of the Land Transfer Act 1952\.
    
    (3) Where a plan of the land in any such agreement or licence has not been deposited as required by the District Land Registrar under [section 167][71] of the Land Transfer Act 1952, he may, after constituting the agreement or licence a folium of the register book, endorse thereupon the words ""Limited as to parcels""; and where a registered agreement or registered licence is so endorsed it shall have the same effect as if it were registered against a certificate of title limited as to parcels under [Part 12][72] of the Land Transfer Act 1952\.
    
    (4) Where a plan is deposited as required by the District Land Registrar under [section 167][71] of the Land Transfer Act 1952 in respect of the land comprised in any such agreement or licence which is limited as to parcels, the District Land Registrar shall, if necessary, without payment of any further fee, correct the description of the land by making an appropriate endorsement on the folium of the register book constituted by the agreement or licence and shall endorse that folium to show that the agreement or licence is no longer limited as to parcels.
    
    (5) Where any such agreement or licence has been registered as aforesaid (whether before or after the commencement of this Act), every transfer, mortgage, lease, transmission, and other disposition of the land comprised therein may be registered in the same manner, subject to any modifications prescribed by any regulations made under this section, and subject to the provisions of [section 37][46], as a similar transfer, mortgage, lease, transmission, or disposition of a registered lease.
    
    (6) The same fee shall be payable on the registration of any transfer, mortgage, lease, transmission, or other disposition of the land comprised in any such agreement or licence, as on the registration of a similar transfer, mortgage, lease, transmission, or other disposition of an estate in fee simple in land.
    
    (7) The covenants, conditions, and restrictions contained or implied in any such agreement or licence registered under this section, and the amount of or allocation of the purchase price or the rate or rates of interest payable thereon, may from time to time be varied by a memorandum of variation thereof signed by the Corporation and the purchaser or licensee for the time being and registered in a form approved by the District Land Registrar. The same registration fee shall be payable on any such memorandum of variation as on a memorandum of extension of a lease. If the land affected by the memorandum of variation is at the time of registration thereof subject to any mortgage, then, except where that mortgage is in favour of the Corporation, the memorandum shall not be binding on the mortgagee unless he has consented thereto in writing upon the memorandum.
    
    (8) Where the Corporation lawfully rescinds or the purchaser surrenders or partially surrenders any such agreement or licence which has been registered under this section, the Corporation may send a notice of rescission or surrender to the District Land Registrar, who, without further notice or inquiry and without fee, shall enter a memorial thereof upon the register.
    
    (9) Where the purchaser's estate or interest under any such registered agreement or under any such registered licence is subject to any registered encumbrance, lien, or other interest, the District Land Registrar, before issuing a certificate of title under the [Land Transfer Act 1952][70] in respect of the land, shall make all entries necessary to record on the certificate of title every existing registered encumbrance, lien, and interest, in the order of their registered priority; and the purchaser's estate or interest in the land shall be subject to every such encumbrance, lien, and interest as if it had been created in respect of that estate.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Housing Act 1955\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 July 2006, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][104] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][105] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][106] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][107] and [17E][108] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
