*   2\. The Standing Group on Emergency Questions shall, on a continuing basis, review and assess:
        
    *   --- each Participating Country's measures in order that allocation of oil will be carried out pursuant to this Chapter and Chapter IV,
    
    *   --- the effectiveness of measures actually taken by each Participating Country.
    
    

*   3\. The Standing Group on Emergency Questions shall report to the Management Committee, which shall make proposals, as appropriate, to the Governing Board. The Governing Board may, acting by majority, adopt recommendations to Participating Countries.

*   4\. The Governing Board shall, acting by majority, decide promptly on the practical procedures for the allocation of oil and on the procedures and modalities for the participation of oil companies therein within the framework of this Agreement.

### Article 7
    
*   1\. When allocation of oil is carried out pursuant to Article 13, 14, or 15, each Participating Country shall have a supply right equal to its permissible consumption less its emergency reserve drawdown obligation.

*   2\. A Participating Country whose supply right exceeds the sum of its normal domestic production and actual net imports available during an emergency shall have an allocation right which entitles it to additional net imports equal to that excess.

*   3\. A Participating Country in which the sum of normal domestic production and actual net imports available during an emergency exceeds its supply right shall have an allocation obligation which requires it to supply, directly or indirectly, the quantity of oil equal to that excess to other Participating Countries. This would not preclude any Participating Country from maintaining exports of oil to non-participating countries.

*   4\. The term ""permissible consumption"" means the average daily rate of final consumption allowed when emergency demand restraint at the applicable level has been activated; possible further voluntary demand restraint by any Participating Country shall not affect its allocation right or obligation.

*   5\. The term ""emergency reserve drawdown obligation"" means the emergency reserve commitment of any Participating Country divided by the total emergency reserve commitment of the group and multiplied by the group supply shortfall.

*   6\. The term ""group supply shortfall"" means the shortfall for the group as measured by the aggregate permissible consumption for the group minus the daily rate of oil supplies available to the group during an emergency.

*   7\. The term ""oil supplies available to the group"" means
        
    *   --- all crude oil available to the group,
    
    *   --- all petroleum products imported from outside the group, and
    
    *   --- all finished products and refinery feedstocks which are produced in association with natural gas and crude oil and are available to the group.
    
    

*   8\. The term ""final consumption"" means total domestic consumption of all finished petroleum products.

### Article 8
    
*   1\. When allocation of oil to a Participating Country is carried out pursuant to Article 17, that Participating Country shall
        
    *   --- sustain from its final consumption the reduction in its oil supplies up to a level equal to 7 percent of its final consumption during the base period,
    
    *   --- have an allocation right equal to the reduction in its oil supplies which results in a reduction of its final consumption over and above that level.
    
    

*   2\. The obligation to allocate this amount of oil is shared among the other Participating Countries on the basis of their final consumption during the base period.

*   3\. The Participating Countries may meet their allocation obligations by any measures of their own choosing, including demand restraint measures or use of emergency reserves.

### Article 9
    
*   1\. For purposes of satisfying allocation rights and allocation obligations, the following elements will be included:
        
    *   --- all crude oil,
    
    *   --- all petroleum products,
    
    *   --- all refinery feedstocks, and
    
    *   --- all finished products produced in association with natural gas and crude oil.
    
    

*   2\. To calculate a Participating Country's allocation right, petroleum products normally imported by that Participating Country, whether from other Participating Countries or from non-participating countries, shall be expressed in crude oil equivalent and treated as though they were imports of crude oil to that Participating Country.

*   3\. Insofar as possible, normal channels of supply will be maintained as well as the normal supply proportions between crude oil and products and among different categories of crude oil and products.

*   4\. When allocation takes place, an objective of the Program shall be that available crude oil and products shall, insofar as possible be shared within the refining and distributing industries as well as between refining and distributing companies in accordance with historical supply patterns.

### Article 10
    
*   1\. The objectives of the Program shall include ensuring fair treatment for all Participating Countries and basing the price for allocated oil on the price conditions prevailing for comparable commercial transactions.

*   2\. Questions relating to the price of oil allocated during an emergency shall be examined by the Standing Group on Emergency Questions.

### Article 11
    
*   1\. It is not an objective of the Program to seek to increase, in an emergency, the share of world oil supply that the group had under normal market conditions. Historical oil trade patterns should be preserved as far as is reasonable, and due account should be taken of the position of individual non-participating countries.

*   2\. In order to maintain the principles set out in paragraph 1, the Management Committee shall make proposals, as appropriate, to the Governing Board, which, acting by majority, shall decide on such proposals.

## Chapter IV

    *   A. Stocks included:
        
        crude oil, major products and unfinished oils held
            
        *   --- in refinery tanks
        
        *   --- in bulk terminals

        *   --- in oil tankers in port
        
        *   --- in inland ship bunkers
        
        *   --- in storage tank bottoms

    *   B. Stocks excluded:
            
        *   (a) crude oil not yet produced
        
        *   (b) crude oil, major products and unfinished oils held
                
            *   --- in pipelines
            
            *   --- in rail tank cars
            
            *   --- in truck tank cars

*   2\. That portion of oil stocks which can be credited toward each Participating Country's emergency reserve commitment is its total oil stocks under the above definition minus those stocks which can be technically determined as being absolutely unavailable in even the most severe emergency. The Standing Group on Emergency Questions shall examine this concept and report on criteria for the measurement of absolutely unavailable stocks.

*   3\. Until a decision has been taken on this matter, each Participating Country shall subtract 10 per cent from its total stocks in measuring its emergency reserves.

*   4\. The Standing Group on Emergency Questions shall examine and report to the Management Committee on:
        
    *   (a) the modalities of including naphtha for uses other than motor and aviation gasoline in the consumption against which stocks are measured,
    
    *   (b) the possibility of creating common rules for the treatment of marine bunkers in an emergency, and of including marine bunkers in the consumption against which stocks are measured,
    
    *   (c) the possibility of creating common rules concerning demand restraint for aviation bunkers,
    
    *   (d) the possibility of crediting towards emergency reserve commitments some portion of oil at sea at the time of activation of emergency measures,

### Article 2
    
*   1\. Fuel switching capacity is defined as normal oil consumption that may be replaced by other fuels in an emergency, provided that this capacity is subject to government control in an emergency, can be brought into operation within one month, and that secure supplies of the alternative fuel are available for use.

*   2\. The supply of alternative fuel shall be expressed in terms of oil equivalent.

*   3\. Stocks of an alternative fuel reserved for fuel switching purposes may be credited towards emergency reserve commitments insofar as they can be used during the period of self-sufficiency.

*   4\. Stand-by production of an alternative fuel reserved for fuel switching purposes will be credited towards emergency reserve commitments on the same basis as stand-by oil production, subject to the provisions of Article 4 of this Annex.

*   5\. The Standing Group on Emergency Questions shall examine and report to the Management Committee on
        
    *   (a) the appropriateness of the time limit of one month mentioned in paragraph 1,
    
    *   (b) the basis of accounting for the fuel switching capacity based on stocks of an alternative fuel, subject to the provisions of paragraph 3\.
    
    

### Article 3

A Participating Country may credit towards its emergency reserve commitment oil stocks in another country provided that the Government of that other country has an agreement with the Government of the Participating Country that it shall impose no impediment to the transfer of those stocks in an emergency to the Participating Country.

### Article 4
    
*   1\. Stand-by oil production is defined as a Participating Country's potential oil production in excess of normal oil production within its jurisdiction
        
    *   --- which is subject to government control, and
    
    *   --- which can be brought into use during an emergency within the period of self-sufficiency.
    
    

*   2\. The Standing Group on Emergency Questions shall examine and report to the Management Committee on
        
    *   (a) the concept of and methods of measurement of stand-by oil production as referred to in paragraph 1,
    
    *   (b) the appropriateness of ""the period of self-sufficiency"" as a time limit,
    
    *   (c) the question of whether a given quantity of stand-by oil production is of greater value for purposes of emergency self-sufficiency than the same quantity of oil stocks, the amount of a possible credit for stand-by production, and the method of its calculation.
    
    

### Article 5

Stand-by oil production available to a Participating Country within the jurisdiction of another country may be credited towards its emergency reserve commitment on the same basis as stand-by oil production within its own jurisdiction, subject to the provisions of Article 4 of this Annex provided that the Government of that other country has an agreement with the Government of the Participating Country that it shall impose no impediment to the supply of oil from that stand-by capacity to the Participating Country in an emergency.

### Article 6

The Standing Group on Emergency Questions shall examine and report to the Management Committee on the possibility of crediting towards a Participating Country's emergency reserve commitment mentioned in Article 2, paragraph 2, of the Agreement, long term investments which have the effect of reducing the Participating Countries' dependence on imported oil.

### Article 7
    
*   1\. The Standing Group on Emergency Questions shall examine and report to the Management Committee regarding the reference period set out in Article 2, paragraph 1, of the Agreement, in particular taking into account such factors as growth, seasonal variations in consumption and cyclical changes.

*   2\. A decision by the Governing Board to change the definition of the reference period mentioned in paragraph 1 shall be taken by unanimity.

### Article 8

The Standing Group on Emergency Questions shall examine and report to the Management Committee on all elements of Chapters I to IV of the Agreement to eliminate possible mathematical and statistical anomalies.

### Article 9

The reports from the Standing Group on Emergency Questions on the matters mentioned in this Annex shall be submitted to the Management Committee by 1st April, 1975\. The Management Committee shall make proposals, as appropriate, to the Governing Board, which, acting by majority, not later than 1st July, 1975, shall decide on these proposals, except as provided for in Article 7, paragraph 2, of this Annex.

    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][29] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][30] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][31] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][32] and [17E][33] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   â¢omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   â¢typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   â¢layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   â¢indentation
