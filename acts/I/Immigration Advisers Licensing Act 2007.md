    (2) Despite subsection (1), a person who is not ordinarily resident in New Zealand need not be licensed in respect of immigration advice provided by the person outside New Zealand before the date that is 3 years after the day on which this Act receives the Royal assent, and---
        
    *   (a) [section 9][12] does not require the Department to refuse to accept an immigration application or request from such a person before that date; and

    (3) A person to whom subsection (2) applies may however apply for and be granted a licence at any time after the date that is 1 year after the day on which this Act receives the Royal assent, if the person chooses to apply.

##### 9 No acceptance of immigration applications or requests from unlicensed immigration advisers
    
*   (1) No immigration application or request put forward on behalf of another person by an unlicensed immigration adviser may be accepted, unless the adviser is exempt from the requirement to be licensed under [section 11][14].
    
    (2) The chief executive of the department of State that has, with the authority of the Prime Minister, assumed responsibility for the administration of the [Immigration Act 2009][117] must so far as practicable ensure that immigration forms and information brochures prepared or provided by that department advise that, in accordance with subsection (1), immigration applications or requests provided or prepared on behalf of another person by persons who are neither licensed immigration advisers nor exempt from the requirement to be licensed will not be accepted.
    
    (3) Where an immigration application or request on behalf of another person is not accepted by reason of contravening subsection (1), the relevant person or body must notify that person in writing of that fact, and advise the person as to how the application or request may be relodged or advanced in an acceptable manner.
