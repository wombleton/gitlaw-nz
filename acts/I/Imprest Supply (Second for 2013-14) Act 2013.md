    *   (b) expenses and non-departmental capital expenditure incurred under a multi-category appropriation (within the meaning of clause 3 of [Schedule 1][11] of the Public Finance Act 1989).
    
    (2) In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, _asset_, _capital expenditure_, _financial year_, _intelligence and security department_, _Minister_, _Office of Parliament_, _operating surplus_, _remeasurements_, _responsible Minister_, and _Vote_ have the meanings given to them by [section 2(1)][12] of the Public Finance Act 1989\.

    (2) The amount of net asset holding in a department or an Office of Parliament during the 2013/14 year may exceed the projected balance for that department or Office of Parliament.
    
    (3) However, the aggregate of the excess amounts for all departments and Offices of Parliament together with the total net asset holding of any department that is not listed in [Schedule 5][14] of the Appropriation (2013/14 Estimates) Act 2013 must not exceed $800 million.
    
    (4) For the purposes of subsections (1) and (2), the amount of net asset holding in a department or an Office of Parliament does not include---
        
    *   (a) any operating surplus retained as agreed between the Minister and the responsible Minister for a department or an Office of Parliament in accordance with [section 22(1)][15] of the Public Finance Act 1989 that is not reflected in [Schedule 5][14] of the Appropriation (2013/14 Estimates) Act 2013; or
