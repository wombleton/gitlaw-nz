##### 6 Illegal contracts to be of no effect
    
*   (1) Notwithstanding any rule of law or equity to the contrary, but subject to the provisions of this Act and of any other enactment, every illegal contract shall be of no effect and no person shall become entitled to any property under a disposition made by or pursuant to any such contract:
    
    provided that nothing in this section shall invalidate---
        
    *   (a) any disposition of property by a party to an illegal contract for valuable consideration; or
    
    *   (b) any disposition of property made by or through a person who became entitled to the property under a disposition to which paragraph (a) applies---
    
    if the person to whom the disposition was made was not a party to the illegal contract and had not at the time of the disposition notice that the property was the subject of, or the whole or part of the consideration for, an illegal contract and otherwise acts in good faith.
    
    (2) In this section, _disposition_ means---

    *   (f) any transaction entered into by any person with intent thereby to diminish, directly or indirectly, the value of that person's own estate and to increase the value of the estate of any other person.

    *   (a) any party to an illegal contract; or
    
    *   (b) any party to a contract who is disqualified from enforcing it by reason of the commission of an illegal act in the course of its performance; or
    
    *   (c) any person claiming through or under any such party---
    
    such relief by way of restitution, compensation, variation of the contract, validation of the contract in whole or part or for any particular purpose, or otherwise howsoever as the court in its discretion thinks just.
    
    (2) An application under subsection (1) may be made by---
        
    *   (a) any person to whom the court may grant relief pursuant to subsection (1); or
    
    *   (b) any other person where it is material for that person to know whether relief will be granted under that subsection.
    
    (3) In considering whether to grant relief under subsection (1), and the nature and extent of any relief to be granted, the court shall have regard to---
        
    *   (a) the conduct of the parties; and
    
    *   (b) in the case of a breach of an enactment, the object of the enactment and the gravity of the penalty expressly provided for any breach thereof; and
    
    *   (c) such other matters as it thinks proper;
    
    but shall not grant relief if it considers that to do so would not be in the public interest.
    
    (4) The court may make an order under subsection (1) notwithstanding that the person granted relief entered into the contract or committed an unlawful act or unlawfully omitted to do an act with knowledge of the facts or law giving rise to the illegality, but the court shall take such knowledge into account in exercising its discretion under that subsection.
    
    (5) The court may by any order made under subsection (1) vest any property that was the subject of, or the whole or part of the consideration for, an illegal contract in any party to the proceedings or may direct any such party to transfer or assign any such property to any other party to the proceedings.
    
    (6) Any order made under subsection (1), or any provision of any such order, may be made upon and subject to such terms and conditions as the court thinks fit.
    
    (7) Subject to the express provisions of any other enactment, no court shall, in respect of any illegal contract, grant relief to any person otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this Act.
    
    Section 7(3): amended, on 19 December 2002, by [section 5][18] of the Illegal Contracts Amendment Act 2002 (2002 No 82).

##### 8 Restraints of trade
    
*   (1) Where any provision of any contract constitutes an unreasonable restraint of trade, the court may---
        
    *   (a) delete the provision and give effect to the contract as so amended; or
    
    *   (b) so modify the provision that at the time the contract was entered into the provision as modified would have been reasonable, and give effect to the contract as so modified; or
    
    *   (c) where the deletion or modification of the provision would so alter the bargain between the parties that it would be unreasonable to allow the contract to stand, decline to enforce the contract.
    
    (2) The court may modify a provision under paragraph (b) of subsection (1), notwithstanding that the modification cannot be effected by the deletion of words from the provision.

##### 9 Jurisdiction of District Courts

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Illegal Contracts Act 1970\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 3 December 2007, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][21] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][22] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][23] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][24] and [17E][25] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
