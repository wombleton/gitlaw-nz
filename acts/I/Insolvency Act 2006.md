#### Interest

##### 264 Pre-adjudication interest
    
*   A creditor may claim interest up to the date of adjudication,---
        
    *   (a) in the case of contract debt interest, at the rate specified in the contract that provides for interest on the debt; or
    
    *   (b) in the case of judgment debt interest, at the rate payable on the debt.
    
    Compare: 1993 No 105 [s 311(1)][718]

##### 265 Post-adjudication interest at prescribed rate if surplus remains
    
*   (1) The Assignee must pay interest on all admitted creditors' claims at the prescribed rate if there are surplus assets left after the Assignee has paid the claims.
    
    (2) The Assignee must pay interest from the date of adjudication to the date when each debt is paid.
    
    (3) If the surplus is not enough to pay interest in full on all debts, payment of interest must abate rateably among them all.
    
    ###### Example
    
    A and B are the only creditors of the bankrupt, C. A's contract with C provided for interest of 20%, but B's contract did not provide for interest. C's bankruptcy commenced on 1 April 2002\. At that date---(1) C owed A $1,000 plus $100 contractual debt interest; and (2) C owed B $2,000 but no interest. A can prove in the bankruptcy for $1,100 and B for $2,000\. The Assignee pays their claims in full on 1 April 2003, 1 year after the commencement of the bankruptcy. If there are surplus assets after the Assignee has paid the claims of A and B in full, the Assignee must use the surplus to pay interest on both debts for the period from 1 April 2002 to 1 April 2003\. If there is enough, and assuming that the prescribed rate is 10%, the Assignee must pay A $110 and B $200 in post-adjudication interest. Assume that the Assignee has a surplus of only $155\. In that case A and B share pro rata, so that A is paid $55 in post-adjudication interest, and B is paid $100\.

    *   (a) in the case of a contract debt, the difference between the prescribed rate and the rate specified in the contract:
    
    *   (b) in the case of a judgment debt, the difference between the prescribed rate and the rate payable on the debt.
    
    (2) The Assignee must pay interest from the date of adjudication to the date when each creditor's claim is paid.
    
    (3) If the surplus is not enough to pay additional post-adjudication interest in full on the creditors' claims eligible for that interest, payment of interest must abate rateably among them all.
