## Part 1  
Preliminary provisions

#### Purposes and principles

##### 3 Purposes
    
*   (1) The purposes of this Act are to---
        
    *   (a) promote the maintenance of a sound and efficient insurance sector; and
    
    *   (b) promote public confidence in the insurance sector.
    
    (2) Those purposes are achieved by---
        
    *   (a) establishing a system for licensing insurers; and
    
    *   (b) imposing prudential requirements on insurers; and
    
    *   (c) providing for the supervision by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (the _Bank_) of compliance with those requirements; and
    
    *   (d) conferring certain powers on the Bank to act in respect of insurers in financial distress or other difficulties.
    
    

##### 4 Principles to be taken into account under this Act
    
*   In achieving the purposes of this Act, the Bank must take into account the following principles that are relevant to the performance of functions or duties imposed, or the exercise of powers conferred, on the Bank by this Act:
        
    *   (a) the importance of insurance to members of the public in terms of their personal or business risk management:
    
    *   (b) the importance of maintaining the sustainability of the New Zealand insurance market:
    
    *   (c) the importance of dealing with an insurer in financial distress or other difficulties in a manner that aims to---
            
        *   (i) adequately protect the interests of its policyholders and the public interest; and
        
        *   (ii) ensure that any failure, or possible failure, of the insurer does not have the potential to significantly damage the financial system or the economy of New Zealand:
        
        
    
    *   (d) the importance of recognising---
            
        *   (i) that it is not a purpose of this Act to eliminate all risk of insurer failure; and
        
        *   (ii) that members of the public are responsible for their own decisions relating to insurance:
        
        
    
    *   (e) the desirability of providing to the public adequate information to enable members of the public to make those decisions:
    
    *   (f) the desirability of consistency in the treatment of similar institutions (while recognising that the New Zealand insurance market comprises a diversity of institutions):
    
    *   (g) the need to maintain competition within the insurance sector:
    
    *   (h) the need to avoid unnecessary compliance costs:
    
    *   (i) the desirability of sound governance of insurers:
    
    *   (j) the desirability of effective risk management by insurers.

    *   (a) is established in the records of a life insurer; and
    
    *   (b) relates solely to the life insurance business of the life insurer or a particular part of that business.
    
    (3) This subpart does not apply to a life insurer that is included in a class of insurers that is the subject of an exemption under [section 238(1)(a)(iv)][311].

##### 83 Overview of requirements regarding statutory funds
    
*   (1) The principal requirements of this subpart in relation to statutory funds may be summarised as follows:
        
    *   (a) all amounts received by a life insurer in respect of the business of a fund must be credited to the fund:
    
    *   (b) all assets and investments related to the business of a fund must be included in the fund:
    
    *   (c) all liabilities (including policy liabilities) of the life insurer arising out of the conduct of the business of a fund must be treated as liabilities of the fund:
    
    *   (d) the assets of a fund are only available for expenditure related to the conduct of the business of the fund:

    (2) This section is only a guide to the general scheme and effect of this subpart.

##### 84 Meaning of life policy
    
*   (1) For the purposes of this Act, each of the following constitutes a _life policy_:
        
    *   (a) a contract of insurance that provides for the payment of money on the death of a person or on the happening of a contingency dependent on the termination or continuance of human life:
    
    *   (b) a contract of insurance that is subject to payment of premiums for a term dependent on the termination or continuance of human life:
    
    *   (c) a contract of insurance that provides for the payment of an annuity for a term dependent on the continuance of human life:

        *   (ii) injury to, or a disability of, the insured person as a result of accident or sickness; or
        
        *   (iii) the insured person being found to have a stated condition or disease:
        
        
    
    *   (e) a contract of insurance that constitutes an investment account contract:
    
    *   (f) a contract of insurance that constitutes an investment-linked contract (within the meaning of [section 98][126]).
    
    (2) However, subsection (1) is subject to subsections (3) and (4) and [section 85][113].
    
    (3) A contract that provides for the payment of a benefit on the death of a person is not a life policy if,---
        
    *   (a) by the terms of the contract, the duration of the contract is to be not more than 1 year; and
    
    *   (b) payment is only to be made in the event of---

    (5) In subsection (1)(e), _investment account contract_ means a contract that---
        
    *   (a) provides for benefits to be paid---
            
        *   (i) on death; or
        
        *   (ii) on a specified date or specified dates or on death before the specified date, or the last of the specified dates, as the case may be; and

    *   (c) provides for the account to be increased (for example, by the amounts of premiums paid or interest payable).

    *   (a) 1 or more of the circumstances specified in [section 145(a) to (c)][189] apply; or
    
    *   (b) the business and affairs of the licensed insurer are so closely connected with the associated person that a statutory manager would be unable to exercise effectively the powers conferred by this subpart in relation to the insurer unless the statutory manager is also appointed as statutory manager of the associated person; or
    
    *   (c) the associated person is, or may be, operating fraudulently or recklessly in a manner prejudicial to the solvency of the insurer or its ability to comply with this Act or the regulations, and that it is desirable that the person be declared to be subject to statutory management for the purpose of---
            
        *   (i) limiting or preventing the risk of further deterioration of the financial affairs of the person; or
        
        *   (ii) limiting or preventing the carrying out, or the effects, of any fraudulent act or activity; or
        
        *   (iii) enabling the affairs of the person to be dealt with in a more orderly or expeditious way.
        
        
    
    (2) However, the Bank must not make a recommendation under [section 170][221] in respect of an associated person of a licensed insurer unless it is satisfied on reasonable grounds that the public interest, the financial system or economy of New Zealand, or any policyholders of the person or of the insurer cannot be adequately protected under the provisions of this Act other than this subpart or under the [Companies Act 1993][338].
    
    (3) If an associated person of a licensed insurer is also a licensed insurer, the Bank may make a recommendation under [section 170][221] in respect of the person on any of the grounds in subsection (1) or [section 173][224].
    
    (4) [Section 173][224] does not limit subsection (3).

##### 175 Bank must give notice of recommendation
    
*   The Bank must, as soon as practicable after the making of an Order in Council under [section 170][221] declaring a licensed insurer or an associated person of a licensed insurer to be subject to statutory management, give written notice to the insurer or associated person stating the grounds on which the Bank's recommendation was made.

    (2) For the purposes of this subpart, unless the context otherwise requires,---
        
    *   (a) references to a statutory manager, if 2 or more persons are appointed as statutory managers, include references to those statutory managers:
    
    *   (b) if an associated person of a licensed insurer is declared to be subject to statutory management, or a subsidiary of a licensed insurer becomes subject to statutory management under [section 170(2) or (3)][221],---
            
        *   (i) references to a licensed insurer in this subpart must be read as including references to the associated person or subsidiary, as the case may be; and
        
        *   (ii) references to a corporation in the provisions of the [Corporations (Investigation and Management) Act 1989][438] (as applied by [section 180][233]) must be read as including references to the associated person or subsidiary, as the case may be.
        
        
    
    

##### 177 Continuation of statutory management of companies restored to New Zealand register
    
*   (1) This section applies to a licensed insurer, an associated person of a licensed insurer, or a subsidiary of a licensed insurer that has been removed from the New Zealand register under [section 317][439] of the Companies Act 1993 while subject to statutory management.
