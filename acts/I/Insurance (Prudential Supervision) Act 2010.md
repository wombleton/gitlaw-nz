## Part 1  
Preliminary provisions

#### Purposes and principles

##### 3 Purposes
    
*   (1) The purposes of this Act are to---
        
    *   (a) promote the maintenance of a sound and efficient insurance sector; and
    
    *   (b) promote public confidence in the insurance sector.
    
    (2) Those purposes are achieved by---
        
    *   (a) establishing a system for licensing insurers; and
    
    *   (b) imposing prudential requirements on insurers; and
    
    *   (c) providing for the supervision by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (the _Bank_) of compliance with those requirements; and
    
    *   (d) conferring certain powers on the Bank to act in respect of insurers in financial distress or other difficulties.
    
    

##### 4 Principles to be taken into account under this Act
    
*   In achieving the purposes of this Act, the Bank must take into account the following principles that are relevant to the performance of functions or duties imposed, or the exercise of powers conferred, on the Bank by this Act:
        
    *   (a) the importance of insurance to members of the public in terms of their personal or business risk management:
    
    *   (b) the importance of maintaining the sustainability of the New Zealand insurance market:
    
    *   (c) the importance of dealing with an insurer in financial distress or other difficulties in a manner that aims to---
            
        *   (i) adequately protect the interests of its policyholders and the public interest; and
        
        *   (ii) ensure that any failure, or possible failure, of the insurer does not have the potential to significantly damage the financial system or the economy of New Zealand:
        
        
    
    *   (d) the importance of recognising---
            
        *   (i) that it is not a purpose of this Act to eliminate all risk of insurer failure; and
        
        *   (ii) that members of the public are responsible for their own decisions relating to insurance:
        
        
    
    *   (e) the desirability of providing to the public adequate information to enable members of the public to make those decisions:
    
    *   (f) the desirability of consistency in the treatment of similar institutions (while recognising that the New Zealand insurance market comprises a diversity of institutions):
    
    *   (g) the need to maintain competition within the insurance sector:
    
    *   (h) the need to avoid unnecessary compliance costs:
    
    *   (i) the desirability of sound governance of insurers:
    
    *   (j) the desirability of effective risk management by insurers.

    *   (b) a condition that requires a specified amount or proportion of the transferee's or amalgamated entity's insurance business to relate to New Zealand policyholders (whether that amount or proportion is defined in terms of premium revenue, amount of insurance liability, a combination of premium revenue and amount of insurance liability, or in any other way):
    
    *   (c) a condition that requires a licensed insurer or the directors of a licensed insurer (or both) to certify that any conditions have been complied with (being certification that is given at the time or times and in the manner specified in the condition):
    
    *   (d) any other prescribed conditions or conditions that relate to prescribed matters.

##### 51 Requirement for approval is in addition to requirements under other enactments
    
*   [Sections 44 to 50][60] do not limit any other enactment that must be complied with in order to give effect to a proposed transfer or amalgamation that requires approval under section 44 (for example, in the case of amalgamating companies, the requirements of [Part 13][360] of the Companies Act 1993).

*   (1) If the Bank approves a transfer under [section 44][60] and, for the purposes of the transfer, a licensed insurer (the _first insurer_) accepts an assignment of liabilities from another licensed insurer (the _second insurer_), the following are taken to have occurred:
        
    *   (a) contracts of insurance in respect of which liability is accepted by the first insurer (the _transferring contracts_) are to be treated for all purposes as if each contract had been transferred by novation from the second insurer to the first insurer:
    
    *   (b) a policyholder under a transferring contract is taken to have the same rights against the first insurer as the policyholder would have against that insurer had the person's contract of insurance been transferred by novation to the first insurer:
    
    *   (c) the rights of the first insurer against policyholders under transferring contracts are the same as they would be had the transferring contracts been transferred by novation to the first insurer from the second insurer.
    
    (2) An agreement between the first insurer and the second insurer may, with the Bank's approval, allocate liabilities in respect of the transferring contracts (and that agreement is binding on the first insurer, the second insurer, and the policyholders under those contracts).
    
    (3) Subsection (1) is subject to subsection (2).

    (4) A licensed insurer must obtain the Bank's approval before its risk management programme is amended in a material way.
    
    (5) However, if it is not reasonably practicable for a licensed insurer to obtain the Bank's approval before its risk management programme is amended in a material way (for example, because the amendment needs to be made urgently),--- 
        
    *   (a) the insurer may amend the risk management programme before obtaining the approval; but
    
    *   (b) the amendment ceases to have effect if---

    (2) However, if the group programme does not comply with the requirements of [section 73(2)][95] in any respect, the licensed insurer must prepare a supplementary document that, when taken together with the group programme, ensures that the requirements of section 73(2) are complied with (in which case the insurer's risk management programme must be taken to be the group programme together with the supplementary document).

##### 75 Offence to fail to comply with risk management requirements
    
*   A licensed insurer commits an offence if it fails to comply with [section 73][95] and is liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding $500,000\.

    *   (a) declare that a licensed insurer is subject to statutory management; and
    
    *   (b) declare that an associated person of a licensed insurer is subject to statutory management; and
    
    *   (c) appoint 1 or more persons as statutory manager or statutory managers of the licensed insurer or associated person for a specified period.

    *   (a) every subsidiary of a licensed insurer declared to be subject to statutory management, except any subsidiary declared to be a subsidiary to which the order does not apply, is subject to statutory management; and
    
    *   (b) the appointment of a statutory manager for the specified period in respect of the licensed insurer also applies to those subsidiaries.
    
    (3) If a licensed insurer acquires a subsidiary after it has been declared to be subject to statutory management under subsection (1), the subsidiary is not subject to statutory management unless a further Order in Council is made declaring the subsidiary to be subject to statutory management.

##### 171 Statutory management of overseas persons
    
*   If a licensed insurer or an associated person of a licensed insurer that is declared to be subject to statutory management, or a subsidiary of a licensed insurer that becomes subject to statutory management under [section 170(2) or (3)][219], is an overseas person, the provisions of this subpart apply to the property, rights, assets, and liabilities relating to its New Zealand business.

##### 172 Date and time of appointment
    
*   (1) Every Order in Council made under [section 170(1)][219] must specify the date on which, and the time at which, the Order in Council comes into force.
    
    (2) The date and time as specified must not be earlier than the date on which, and the time at which, the Order in Council is made.
    
    (3) If a question arises as to whether, on the date on which a statutory manager was appointed, an act was done or a transaction was entered into or effected before or after the appointment, the act or transaction must, in the absence of proof to the contrary, be treated as having been done, entered into, or effected, as the case may be, after the appointment of the statutory manager.

##### 173 Grounds on which licensed insurer may be declared to be subject to statutory management
    
*   (1) The Bank may make a recommendation under [section 170][219] in respect of a licensed insurer only if it is satisfied on reasonable grounds that---
        
    *   (a) 1 or more of the circumstances specified in [section 143(1)(a) to (f)][185] apply and the failure of the insurer may cause significant damage to the financial system or the economy of New Zealand (or both); or
    
    *   (b) the insurer is, or may be, operating fraudulently or recklessly, and that it is desirable that the insurer be declared to be subject to statutory management for the purpose of---
            
        *   (i) limiting or preventing the risk of further deterioration of the financial affairs of the insurer; or
        
        *   (ii) limiting or preventing the carrying out, or the effects, of any fraudulent act or activity; or
        
        *   (iii) enabling the affairs of the insurer to be dealt with in a more orderly or expeditious way.
        
        
    
    (2) However, the Bank must not make a recommendation under [section 170][219] in respect of a licensed insurer unless it is satisfied on reasonable grounds that the public interest, the financial system or economy of New Zealand, or any policyholders of the insurer cannot be adequately protected under the provisions of this Act other than this subpart or under the [Companies Act 1993][333].

##### 174 Grounds on which associated person may be declared to be subject to statutory management
    
*   (1) The Bank may make a recommendation under [section 170][219] in respect of an associated person of a licensed insurer if it is satisfied on reasonable grounds that---
        
    *   (a) 1 or more of the circumstances specified in [section 145(a) to (c)][187] apply; or
    
    *   (b) the business and affairs of the licensed insurer are so closely connected with the associated person that a statutory manager would be unable to exercise effectively the powers conferred by this subpart in relation to the insurer unless the statutory manager is also appointed as statutory manager of the associated person; or
    
    *   (c) the associated person is, or may be, operating fraudulently or recklessly in a manner prejudicial to the solvency of the insurer or its ability to comply with this Act or the regulations, and that it is desirable that the person be declared to be subject to statutory management for the purpose of---
            
        *   (i) limiting or preventing the risk of further deterioration of the financial affairs of the person; or
        
        *   (ii) limiting or preventing the carrying out, or the effects, of any fraudulent act or activity; or
        
        *   (iii) enabling the affairs of the person to be dealt with in a more orderly or expeditious way.
        
        
    
    (2) However, the Bank must not make a recommendation under [section 170][219] in respect of an associated person of a licensed insurer unless it is satisfied on reasonable grounds that the public interest, the financial system or economy of New Zealand, or any policyholders of the person or of the insurer cannot be adequately protected under the provisions of this Act other than this subpart or under the [Companies Act 1993][333].
    
    (3) If an associated person of a licensed insurer is also a licensed insurer, the Bank may make a recommendation under [section 170][219] in respect of the person on any of the grounds in subsection (1) or [section 173][222].
    
    (4) [Section 173][222] does not limit subsection (3).

##### 175 Bank must give notice of recommendation
    
*   The Bank must, as soon as practicable after the making of an Order in Council under [section 170][219] declaring a licensed insurer or an associated person of a licensed insurer to be subject to statutory management, give written notice to the insurer or associated person stating the grounds on which the Bank's recommendation was made.

##### 176 Application of this subpart to joint statutory managers, associated persons, and subsidiaries
    
*   (1) If an Order in Council is made under [section 170][219] appointing 2 or more persons as statutory managers of a licensed insurer, the order must state whether the powers conferred by this subpart must be exercised by those persons acting together or may be exercised individually.
    
    (2) For the purposes of this subpart, unless the context otherwise requires,---
        
    *   (a) references to a statutory manager, if 2 or more persons are appointed as statutory managers, include references to those statutory managers:
    
    *   (b) if an associated person of a licensed insurer is declared to be subject to statutory management, or a subsidiary of a licensed insurer becomes subject to statutory management under [section 170(2) or (3)][219],---
            
        *   (i) references to a licensed insurer in this subpart must be read as including references to the associated person or subsidiary, as the case may be; and
        
        *   (ii) references to a corporation in the provisions of the [Corporations (Investigation and Management) Act 1989][422] (as applied by [section 180][231]) must be read as including references to the associated person or subsidiary, as the case may be.
        
        
    
    

##### 177 Continuation of statutory management of companies restored to New Zealand register
    
*   (1) This section applies to a licensed insurer, an associated person of a licensed insurer, or a subsidiary of a licensed insurer that has been removed from the New Zealand register under [section 317][423] of the Companies Act 1993 while subject to statutory management.
    
    (2) If a person to whom this section applies is restored to the New Zealand register under [section 328][424] of the Companies Act 1993, the person continues to be subject to statutory management from the date the person is so restored.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Insurance (Prudential Supervision) Act 2010\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 October 2012, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][531] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][532] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][533] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][534] and [17E][535] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
