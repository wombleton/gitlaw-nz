#### _Article 28\. Commencement of a New Zealand insolvency proceeding after recognition of a foreign main proceeding_

##### 
    
*   After recognition by the High Court of a foreign main proceeding, a New Zealand insolvency proceeding may be commenced only if the debtor has assets in New Zealand; the effects of that proceeding shall be restricted to the assets of the debtor that are located in New Zealand and, to the extent necessary to implement co-operation and co-ordination under [articles 25][36], [26][37], and [27][38], to other assets of the debtor that, under the law of New Zealand, should be administered in that proceeding.

#### _Article 29\. Co-ordination of a New Zealand insolvency proceeding and a foreign proceeding_

##### 
    
*   Where a foreign proceeding and a New Zealand insolvency proceeding are taking place concurrently regarding the same debtor, the High Court shall seek co-operation and co-ordination under [articles 25][36], [26][37], and [27][38], and the following shall apply:
        
    *   (a) when the New Zealand insolvency proceeding is taking place at the time the application for recognition of the foreign proceeding is filed,
            
        *   (i) any relief granted under [article 19][35] or [article 21][33] must be consistent with the New Zealand insolvency proceeding;
        
        *   (ii) if the foreign proceeding is recognised in New Zealand as a foreign main proceeding, [article 20][34] does not apply;
        
        
    
    *   (b) when the New Zealand insolvency proceeding commences after recognition, or after the filing of the application for recognition, of the foreign proceeding,
            
        *   (i) any relief in effect under [article 19][35] or [article 21][33] shall be reviewed by the Court and shall be modified or terminated if inconsistent with the New Zealand insolvency proceeding; and
        
        *   (ii) if the foreign proceeding is a foreign main proceeding, the stay and suspension referred to in paragraph (1) of [article 20][34] shall be modified or terminated pursuant to paragraph (2) of article 20 if inconsistent with the New Zealand insolvency proceeding;
        
        
    
    *   (c) in granting, extending, or modifying relief granted to a representative of a foreign non-main proceeding, the Court must be satisfied that the relief relates to assets that, under the law of New Zealand, should be administered in the foreign non-main proceeding or concerns information required in that proceeding.
    
    

#### _Article 30\. Co-ordination of more than one foreign proceeding_

##### 
    
*   In matters referred to in paragraph (1) of [article 1][17], in respect of more than one foreign proceeding regarding the same debtor, the High Court shall seek co-operation and co-ordination under [articles 25][36], [26][37], and [27][38], and the following shall apply:
        
    *   (a) any relief granted under [article 19][35] or [article 21][33] to a representative of a foreign non-main proceeding after recognition of a foreign main proceeding must be consistent with the foreign main proceeding;
    
    *   (b) if a foreign main proceeding is recognised after recognition, or after the filing of an application for recognition, of a foreign non-main proceeding, any relief in effect under [article 19][35] or [article 21][33] shall be reviewed by the Court and shall be modified or terminated if inconsistent with the foreign main proceeding; and
    
    *   (c) if, after recognition of a foreign non-main proceeding, another foreign non-main proceeding is recognised, the Court shall grant, modify, or terminate relief for the purpose of facilitating co-ordination of the proceedings.
    
    

#### _Article 31\. Presumption of insolvency based on recognition of a foreign main proceeding_

##### 
    
*   In the absence of evidence to the contrary, recognition of a foreign main proceeding is, for the purpose of commencing a New Zealand insolvency proceeding, proof that the debtor is insolvent.

#### _Article 32\. Rule of payment in concurrent proceedings_

##### 
    
*   Without prejudice to secured claims or rights _in rem_, a creditor who has received part payment in respect of its claim in a proceeding pursuant to a law relating to insolvency in a foreign State may not receive a payment for the same claim in a New Zealand insolvency proceeding regarding the same debtor, so long as the payment to the other creditors of the same class is proportionately less than the payment the creditor has already received.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Insolvency (Cross-border) Act 2006\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 February 2011, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][45] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][46] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][47] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][48] and [17E][49] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
