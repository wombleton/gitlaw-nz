##### 20 Society not to engage in operations involving pecuniary gain
    
*   (1) No society shall do any act of such a nature that if the doing thereof were one of the objects for which the society was established the members of the society would be deemed to be associated for pecuniary gain within the meaning of [sections 4][5] and [5][6] hereof.
    
    (2) Every society which does any such act shall be liable to a fine not exceeding 100 pounds.

    (3A) Notwithstanding anything in subsection (3) of this section, the High Court, on an application made to it by any member of the society, may in its discretion, if it is satisfied that any such condition as aforesaid has not been duly fulfilled, declare the alteration to be void in whole or in part, and order that the registration be cancelled in whole or in part, and may by the order give such directions and make such provisions as seem just in the circumstances of the case. On the delivery to the Registrar of a sealed copy of the court's order he shall forthwith amend the register accordingly.
    
    (4) No alteration in the objects of a society shall be registered unless the Registrar is satisfied either that the alteration is not of such a nature as to prejudicially affect any existing creditor of the society, or that all creditors who may be so affected consent to the alteration.
    
    (5) In the case of any alteration of the name of a society the Registrar may, in his discretion, refuse to register the alteration until the making thereof has been publicly advertised in such manner as the Registrar thinks fit.
