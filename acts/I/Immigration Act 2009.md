    (4) However, the chief executive may give general instructions to immigration officers and refugee and protection officers on the order and manner of processing any application or claim, or specified classes of application or claim, and, if so, an immigration officer or a refugee and protection officer must process an application or claim in accordance with those instructions.
    
    (5) In giving any instructions, the chief executive may have regard to such matters as the chief executive thinks fit.

    *   (a) are matters of rules and practice of the Department; and
    
    *   (b) are not immigration instructions.
    
    (10) To avoid doubt, nothing in this Act, or in any other law or enactment, requires an immigration officer or a refugee and protection officer to process an application or claim in any particular order or manner unless required to do so by---

    *   (f) a revocation of an invitation to apply for a visa.

##### 188 Determination of appeal in relation to residence class visa
    
*   (1) In determining an appeal under [section 187][234], the Tribunal may---
        
    *   (a) confirm the decision appealed against as having been correct in terms of the residence instructions applicable at the time the application for the visa was made by the appellant; or
    
    *   (b) reverse the decision as having been incorrect in terms of the residence instructions applicable at the time the application for the visa was made by the appellant; or
    
    *   (c) note the correctness of the original decision in terms of the residence instructions applicable at the time the visa application was made on the basis of the information provided to the Minister or the immigration officer before the time of the decision, but reverse that decision on the basis of any information properly made available to the Tribunal that reveals that the grant of the visa would have been correct in terms of the applicable residence instructions; or
    
    *   (d) note the correctness of the original decision in terms of the residence instructions applicable at the time the visa application was made on the basis of the information provided to the Minister or the immigration officer before the time of the decision, but determine the appeal by cancelling the decision and referring the matter back to the Minister, if he or she made the decision, or the chief executive, in any other case, for consideration under those residence instructions as if a new visa application had been made that included any additional information properly provided to the Tribunal; or
    
    *   (e) determine the appeal by cancelling the decision and referring the application back to the Minister, if he or she made the decision, or the chief executive, in any other case, for correct assessment in terms of the applicable residence instructions, where the Tribunal---
            
        *   (i) considers that the decision appealed against was made on the basis of an incorrect assessment in terms of the residence instructions applicable at the time the application was made; but
        
        *   (ii) is not satisfied that the appellant would, but for that incorrect assessment, have been entitled in terms of those instructions to the visa or entry permission; or
        
        
    
    *   (f) confirm the decision as having been correct in terms of the residence instructions applicable at the time the visa application was made, but recommend that the special circumstances of the applicant are such as to warrant consideration by the Minister as an exception to those instructions.
    
    (2) Where the Tribunal determines to reverse a decision to refuse a visa under subsection (1)(b) or (c), the Tribunal must---
        
    *   (a) consider whether it is appropriate that conditions should be imposed in accordance with [section 50][64] when a resident visa is granted to the appellant; and
    
    *   (b) if it considers that imposing conditions is appropriate, direct the Minister to impose under that section the conditions specified in its decision (which may be specified with the degree of generality or particularity that the Tribunal thinks fit); and
    
    *   (c) notify the appellant in writing of any conditions imposed.
    
    (3) Where the Tribunal refers an application back to the Minister or the chief executive under subsection (1)(e), the Tribunal may give him or her the directions it thinks fit as to how a correct assessment of the application should be carried out.

##### 189 Use of further information in appeals under section 187
    
*   (1) In determining an appeal under [section 187][234], the Tribunal may not consider any information or evidence adduced by the appellant that was not provided to the Minister or the immigration officer before the time at which the Minister or the officer made the decision that is the subject of the appeal.
    
    (2) Subsection (1) is subject to subsections (3) to (6).
    
    (3) The Tribunal may consider information or evidence not provided by the appellant to the Minister or the immigration officer before the time of the relevant decision if---
        
    *   (a) the Tribunal is satisfied that---
            
        *   (i) the information or evidence existed at the time the decision to refuse the visa was made, and would have been relevant to the making of that decision; and
        
        *   (ii) the appellant could not, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, have placed that information or evidence before the Minister or the immigration officer at the time at which the Minister or the officer made the decision on the application; and

    *   (a) the Tribunal considers that the decision under appeal depended, in whole or in part, upon the recorded results of an interview conducted with the appellant or with some other person connected with the application; and
    
    *   (b) those results involved the recording of an exercise of judgment on the part of the interviewing officer as opposed to the recording of facts; and
    
    *   (c) the Tribunal considers that further written evidence or submissions will not assist to confirm or test those results.
    
    (5) An interview conducted under subsection (4) may not be conducted by any immigration officer who has previously interviewed the person.
    
    (6) The Tribunal may, if it considers it fair in all the circumstances to do so, determine the appeal in the manner set out in [section 188(1)(d)][235] where---

    (2) However, nothing in subsection (1) requires a residence class visa or entry permission to be granted to a person---
        
    *   (a) until the normal requirements for providing any certificate or other material that is required before a visa or entry permission can be granted have been complied with, where the certificate or other material---
            
        *   (i) was not supplied to the Minister or the immigration officer concerned before the date on which the decision appealed against was made; or
        
        *   (ii) by reason of the passing of time, is no longer current for the purposes of granting a visa or entry permission under this Act; or

        *   (i) the residence instructions applicable at the time of the relevant visa application; and
        
        *   (ii) the residence instructions currently applicable.
        
        
    
    (3) Where, in reliance on subsection (2)(a), a residence class visa is not immediately granted to a person who is already in New Zealand, the Minister or an immigration officer must grant a temporary visa to the person, being a visa that is current for a period of not less than 6 months.
    
    (4) The Minister must not impose any conditions on a resident visa granted under subsection (1), unless the Tribunal has directed the Minister to do so under [section 188(2)(b)][235].
    
    (5) Where the Tribunal makes a recommendation under [section 188(1)(f)][235], the Minister---
        
    *   (a) must consider whether a residence class visa should be granted to the appellant as an exception to residence instructions; and
    
    *   (b) may, if he or she grants a resident visa, impose conditions on the visa in accordance with [section 50][64].

    *   (c) determine, in relation to the person, the matters referred to in subsection (1)(b) and (c) of this section.
    
    (3) The Tribunal may uphold or reverse the decision of the refugee and protection officer, but may not refer the claim back to a refugee and protection officer for reconsideration.
    
    (4) If the Tribunal reverses a decision in relation to a person to whom [section 194(5)][243] applies, the Tribunal must dispense with its consideration of any humanitarian appeal lodged by the person in accordance with [section 194(6)(a)][243].
    
    (5) To avoid doubt, nothing in subsection (1) requires the Tribunal to seek any information, evidence, or submissions further to those provided by the appellant.

*   (1) Where an appeal is brought under [section 195(1)(a)][244], the Tribunal must first consider---
        
    *   (a) whether there has been a significant change in circumstances material to the appellant's claim since the previous claim was determined; and
    
    *   (b) if so, whether the change in 1 or more of the circumstances was brought about by the appellant---
            
        *   (i) acting otherwise than in good faith; and
        
        *   (ii) for a purpose of creating grounds for recognition under any of [sections 129 to 131][164].

    (5) If the Tribunal determines that the subsequent claim is manifestly unfounded or clearly abusive, or repeats a previous claim, it must dismiss the appeal.
    
    (6) If the Tribunal does not determine that the subsequent claim is manifestly unfounded or clearly abusive, or repeats a previous claim, it must consider the claim for recognition in accordance with [section 198(1)][247].
    
    (7) Where an appeal is brought under [section 195(2)][244], the Tribunal must determine the matter in accordance with [section 198(1)][247], as if the appeal were an appeal to which that section applied.
    
    (8) If the Tribunal reverses a decision in relation to a person to whom [section 195(6)][244] applies, the Tribunal must dispense with its consideration of any humanitarian appeal lodged in accordance with [section 195(7)(a)][244] by the person.

    *   (b) if it does not recognise the person as a refugee or a protected person, then determine any humanitarian appeal by the person.
    
    (4) When determining whether to recognise a person as a refugee or a protected person for the purposes of this section, the Tribunal must determine the matter in accordance with [section 198(1)][247].

##### 205 Special process if refugee or protected person liable for deportation under section 161
    
*   (1) This section applies if---

##### 207 Grounds for determining humanitarian appeal
    
*   (1) The Tribunal must allow an appeal against liability for deportation on humanitarian grounds only where it is satisfied that---
        
    *   (a) there are exceptional circumstances of a humanitarian nature that would make it unjust or unduly harsh for the appellant to be deported from New Zealand; and
    
    *   (b) it would not in all the circumstances be contrary to the public interest to allow the appellant to remain in New Zealand.
    
    (2) In determining whether it would be unjust or unduly harsh to deport from New Zealand an appellant who became liable for deportation under [section 161][201], and whether it would be contrary to the public interest to allow the appellant to remain in New Zealand, the Tribunal must have regard to any submissions of a victim made in accordance with [section 208][259].
    
    Compare: 1987 No 74 [ss 47(3)][741], [105(1A)][742]

##### 208 Right of victims to make submission on appeal
    
*   (1) In determining a humanitarian appeal by a person who becomes liable for deportation under [section 161][201], the Tribunal must have regard to---
        
    *   (a) any written submissions made to it by a victim of an offence or offences of which the appellant has been convicted and from which the liability for deportation arose; and
    
    *   (b) any relevant written submissions made by a victim to the Minister under [section 173][215].
    
    (2) In addition to, or instead of, making written submissions under this section, the victim may, with the leave of the Tribunal, make oral submissions to the Tribunal at the hearing.
    
    (3) The Tribunal must make available to a lawyer or agent acting for the appellant, on a request by the appellant, a copy of all written submissions made by the victim under [section 173][215] or this section.
    
    (4) The Tribunal, or a lawyer or agent acting for the appellant, must, on a request for the purpose, show the appellant a copy of all written submissions made by the victim under [section 173][215] or this section. However, the appellant may not keep a copy of any of those submissions.
    
    (5) Despite subsections (3) and (4), the Tribunal may withhold from the appellant and every lawyer or agent acting for the appellant (if any) either or both of the following if, in the Tribunal's opinion, that withholding is necessary to protect the physical safety or security of the victim concerned:
        
    *   (a) any part of the victim's written submissions under [section 173][215], whether or not that part was withheld by the Minister under section 173(4):

##### 210 Tribunal may order grant of visa on allowing appeal against liability for deportation
    
*   (1) Without limiting section 209, if the Tribunal decides that an appeal against liability for deportation should be allowed in the case of a person who is unlawfully in New Zealand or is the holder of a temporary entry class visa, the Tribunal may order an immigration officer to grant the successful appellant---
        
    *   (a) a resident visa subject to such conditions (if any) as the Tribunal determines; or
    
    *   (b) a temporary visa for a period not exceeding 12 months subject to such conditions (if any) as the Tribunal determines.
    
    (2) If a temporary visa is granted following an order made under subsection (1)(b), no further appeal against liability for deportation may be brought by the holder upon the expiry of the visa or upon the holder earlier becoming liable for deportation.
    
    (3) The Tribunal may order the imposition of any condition on the grant of a resident visa that it thinks fit, having regard to the reasons why the appellant was able to demonstrate exceptional circumstances of a humanitarian nature or why it was not contrary to the public interest to allow the appellant to remain in New Zealand, whether or not the condition is of a kind authorised by residence instructions.
    
    (4) To avoid doubt, the Tribunal may order an immigration officer to grant a visa, and the officer must grant the visa, even though the person would normally be prohibited from being granted a visa under [section 15][20] or [16][21].
    
    (5) If the Tribunal orders the imposition of any condition on a visa,---
        
    *   (a) the condition must be treated as if it were a condition imposed by the Minister under [section 50][64] or [52][66] (as the case may be); and

    (2) If the appellant is in custody under this Act, an immigration officer must immediately notify, in writing, the manager or other person in charge of the prison or other premises in which the appellant is detained that the appellant's liability for deportation is cancelled, and the appellant must be immediately released.
    
    (3) If the appellant is subject to residence or reporting requirements under [section 315][384], an immigration officer must immediately notify, in writing, the appellant (and, if applicable, his or her guarantor) that the appellant's liability for deportation is cancelled, and the appellant ceases to be subject to those requirements.
    
    (4) If the appellant has been released on conditions under [section 320][395], an immigration officer must immediately notify, in writing, the appellant that his or her liability for deportation is cancelled, and the appellant ceases to be subject to those conditions.

    (2) If a person's liability for deportation has been suspended by the Tribunal under subsection (1), the Minister may subsequently apply to the Tribunal for a determination on whether the person has failed to meet any condition imposed by the Tribunal.
    
    (3) If the Tribunal determines that the person has failed to comply with any condition,---
        
    *   (a) the Tribunal may reactivate the person's liability for deportation by causing an immigration officer to serve a deportation liability notice on the person that sets out the grounds of the reactivation; and
    
    *   (b) the person has 28 days from the date the notice is served to leave New Zealand before he or she may be deported.
    
    (4) In the case of a person in imprisonment, the period referred to in subsection (1) commences on the date of the person's release from imprisonment.
    
    (5) The suspension of a person's liability for deportation does not prevent the person from becoming liable for deportation on other grounds.

    (2) If the person is in custody under this Act, an immigration officer must immediately notify, in writing, the manager or other person in charge of the prison or other premises in which the person is detained that the person's liability for deportation is suspended, and the person must be immediately released.
    
    (3) If the person is subject to residence or reporting requirements under [section 315][384], an immigration officer must immediately notify, in writing, the person and the person's guarantor (if applicable) that the person's liability for deportation is suspended, and the person ceases to be subject to those requirements.
    
    (4) If the person has been released on conditions under [section 320][395], an immigration officer must immediately notify, in writing, the person that his or her liability for deportation is suspended, and the person ceases to be subject to those conditions.

*   (1) This section applies if the Minister suspends a person's liability for deportation, and the person has lodged an appeal under this Part against that liability.
    
    (2) If the person does not withdraw the appeal, the Tribunal may, on the application of the person, adjourn any appeal on humanitarian grounds lodged by the person.

    *   (b) further relevant classified information becomes available that may be relied on in the course of the appeal or matter.

## Schedule 1  
Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees

[ss 127(3)][161], [165][205]

## Done at Geneva on 28 July 1951[1][884]

Entry into force: 22 April 1954, in accordance with Article 43

Text: United Nations Treaty Series No. 2545, Vol. 189, p. 137

#### PREAMBLE

##### The High Contracting Parties

_Considering_ that the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights approved on 10 December 1948 by the General Assembly have affirmed the principle that human beings shall enjoy fundamental rights and freedoms without discrimination.

_Considering_ that the United Nations has, on various occasions, manifested its profound concern for refugees and endeavoured to assure refugees the widest possible exercise of these fundamental rights and freedoms.

_Considering_ that it is desirable to revise and consolidate previous international agreements relating to the status of refugees and to extend the scope of and the protection accorded by such instruments by means of a new agreement.

_Considering_ that the grant of asylum may place unduly heavy burdens on certain countries, and that a satisfactory solution of a problem of which the United Nations has recognized the international scope and nature cannot therefore be achieved without international co-operation.

_Expressing_ the wish that all States, recognizing the social and humanitarian nature of the problem of refugees, will do everything within their power to prevent this problem from becoming a cause of tension between States.

_Noting_ that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is charged with the task of supervising international conventions providing for the protection of refugees, and recognizing that the effective co-ordination of measures taken to deal with this problem will depend upon the co-operation of States with the High Commissioner.

_Have agreed as follows:_

#### CHAPTER I GENERAL PROVISIONS

#### Article 1 Definition of the term ""Refugee""
    
*   A. For the purposes of the present Convention, the term ""refugee"" shall apply to any person who:

*   (1) Has been considered a refugee under the Arrangements of 12 May 1926 and 30 June 1928 or under the Conventions of 28 October 1933 and 10 February 1938, the Protocol of 14 September 1939 or the Constitution of the International Refugee Organization:
    
    Decisions of non-eligibility taken by the International Refugee Organization during the period of its activities shall not prevent the status of refugee being accorded to persons who fulfil the conditions of paragraph 2 of this section:

*   (2) As a result of events occurring before 1 January 1951 and owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country: or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it.
    
    In the case of a person who has more than one nationality, the term ""the country of his nationality"" shall mean each of the countries of which he is a national, and a person shall not be deemed to be lacking the protection of the country of his nationality if, without any valid reason based on well-founded fear, he has not availed himself of the protection of one of the countries of which he is a national.

*   B. (1) For the purposes of this Convention, the words ""events occurring before 1 January 1951"" in Article 1, Section A, shall be understood to mean either:
        
    *   (a) ""events occurring in Europe before 1 January 1951""; or
    
    *   (b) ""events occurring in Europe or elsewhere before 1 January 1951"",
    
    and each Contracting State shall make a declaration at the time of signature, ratification or accession, specifying which of these meanings it applies for the purpose of its obligations under this Convention.[2][885]

*   (2) Any Contracting State which has adopted alternative _(a)_ may at any time extend its obligations by adopting alternative _(b)_ by means of a notification addressed to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.

*   C. This Convention shall cease to apply to any person falling under the terms of section A if:

*   (1) He has voluntarily re-availed himself of the protection of the country of his nationality; or

*   (2) Having lost his nationality, he has voluntarily re-acquired it; or

*   (3) He has acquired a new nationality, and enjoys the protection of the country of his new nationality; or

*   (4) He has voluntarily re-established himself in the country which he left or outside which he remained owing to fear of persecution; or

*   (5) He can no longer, because the circumstances in connexion with which he has been recognized as a refugee have ceased to exist, continue to refuse to avail himself of the protection of the country of his nationality;
    
    Provided that this paragraph shall not apply to a refugee falling under section A (1) of this Article who is able to invoke compelling reasons arising out of previous persecution for refusing to avail himself of the protection of the country of nationality;

*   (6) Being a person who has no nationality he is, because the circumstances in connexion with which he has been recognized as a refugee have ceased to exist, able to return to the country of his former habitual residence;
    
    Provided that this paragraph shall not apply to a refugee falling under section A (1) of this Article who is able to invoke compelling reasons arising out of previous persecution for refusing to return to the country of his former habitual residence.

*   D. This Convention shall not apply to persons who are at present receiving from organs or agencies of the United Nations other than the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees protection or assistance.
    
    When such protection or assistance has ceased for any reason, without the position of such persons being definitively settled in accordance with the relevant resolutions adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations, these persons shall _ipso facto_ be entitled to the benefits of this Convention.

*   E. This Convention shall not apply to a person who is recognized by the competent authorities of the country in which he has taken residence as having the rights and obligations which are attached to the possession of the nationality of that country.

*   F. The provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that:
        
    *   (a) he has committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes;
    
    *   (b) he has committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge prior to his admission to that country as a refugee;
    
    *   (c) he has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.

*   5\. The provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 apply both to the rights and benefits referred to in Articles 13, 18, 19, 21 and 22 of this Convention and to rights and benefits for which this Convention does not provide.

#### Article 8 Exemption from exceptional measures

With regard to exceptional measures which may be taken against the person, property or interests of nationals of a foreign State, the Contracting States shall not apply such measures to a refugee who is formally a national of the said State solely on account of such nationality.

#### Article 9 Provisional measures

Nothing in this Convention shall prevent a Contracting State, in time of war or other grave and exceptional circumstances, from taking provisionally measures which it considers to be essential to the national security in the case of a particular person, pending a determination by the Contracting State that that person is in fact a refugee and that the continuance of such measures is necessary in his case in the interests of national security.

#### Article 10 Continuity of residence
    
*   1\. Where a refugee has been forcibly displaced during the Second World War and removed to the territory of a Contracting State, and is resident there, the period of such enforced sojourn shall be considered to have been lawful residence within that territory.
