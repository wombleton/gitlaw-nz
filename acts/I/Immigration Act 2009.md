    (4) However, the chief executive may give general instructions to immigration officers and refugee and protection officers on the order and manner of processing any application or claim, or specified classes of application or claim, and, if so, an immigration officer or a refugee and protection officer must process an application or claim in accordance with those instructions.
    
    (5) In giving any instructions, the chief executive may have regard to such matters as the chief executive thinks fit.

    (5) Where a decision to grant or refuse to grant a visa or entry permission, or to issue or refuse to issue an invitation to apply for a visa, is made by way of an automated electronic system, that decision must for all purposes be treated as a decision of an immigration officer who is authorised to make the decision under this Act.

#### Limited right of reconsideration concerning temporary entry class visas

##### 185 Right of reconsideration if onshore application for further temporary visa declined
    
*   (1) This section applies to a holder of a temporary visa if---
        
    *   (a) the holder of the temporary visa (the _applicant_) is onshore and applies during the currency of that visa for a further temporary visa; and
    
    *   (b) the application for the further temporary visa is declined; and
    
    *   (c) the Minister did not make the decision to decline the application.
    
    (2) The applicant may apply in the prescribed manner for a reconsideration of the decision to decline a further visa if, and only if,---
        
    *   (a) the application for reconsideration is made not later than 14 days after the date on which the applicant received notice of the decision to decline the further visa; and
    
    *   (b) the applicant is still lawfully in New Zealand at the time of the application for reconsideration.
    
    (3) The decision to decline the visa application must be reconsidered by another immigration officer of equal grade or senior to the one who made the decision, or by the Minister.
    
    (4) If the decision to decline the visa application is confirmed and no visa is granted following reconsideration under this section, an immigration officer must inform the applicant, in writing, of---
        
    *   (a) the decision; and
    
    *   (b) in the case of an applicant who still holds a visa, the date on which the person will have an obligation to leave New Zealand; and

    *   (a) an applicant for a residence class visa may appeal against---
            
        *   (i) a decision of an immigration officer to decline to grant the visa (including in the circumstances described in [section 190(2)(b)][235]):
        
        *   (ii) a decision by the Minister not to grant a residence class visa if classified information has been relied on in making the decision:

    *   (a) a decision by the Minister not to grant a residence class visa (except in the circumstances described in subsection (1)(a)(ii)); or
    
    *   (b) a refusal of the Minister or an immigration officer to grant a residence class visa or entry permission to an excluded person; or

        *   (i) whether personally or through an agent, in expressing his or her interest in obtaining an invitation to apply for a visa, submitted false or misleading information or withheld relevant information that was potentially prejudicial to the person; or

    *   (f) a revocation of an invitation to apply for a visa.
    
    (3) Where a person to whom subsection (1)(b) or (c) applies appeals under this section, this Act applies as if the decision were a decision to decline an application for a residence class visa.

    *   (b) the special circumstances of the appellant are such that consideration of an exception to those residence instructions should be recommended.
    
    (5) An appeal under this section must be brought not later than 42 days after the date the appellant is notified of the decision appealed against.
    
    (6) For the purposes of subsection (5), a written notice that is sent by post to an address supplied by the appellant under [section 57(2)][71] is treated as having been notified to him or her---

    *   (a) the refusal or failure to grant a residence class visa to a person outside New Zealand; or
    
    *   (b) the cancellation of a resident visa granted outside New Zealand before the holder of the visa first arrives in New Zealand as the holder of the visa.

    *   (a) confirm the decision appealed against as having been correct in terms of the residence instructions applicable at the time the application for the visa was made by the appellant; or
    
    *   (b) reverse the decision as having been incorrect in terms of the residence instructions applicable at the time the application for the visa was made by the appellant; or
    
    *   (c) note the correctness of the original decision in terms of the residence instructions applicable at the time the visa application was made on the basis of the information provided to the Minister or the immigration officer before the time of the decision, but reverse that decision on the basis of any information properly made available to the Tribunal that reveals that the grant of the visa would have been correct in terms of the applicable residence instructions; or
    
    *   (d) note the correctness of the original decision in terms of the residence instructions applicable at the time the visa application was made on the basis of the information provided to the Minister or the immigration officer before the time of the decision, but determine the appeal by cancelling the decision and referring the matter back to the Minister, if he or she made the decision, or the chief executive, in any other case, for consideration under those residence instructions as if a new visa application had been made that included any additional information properly provided to the Tribunal; or
    
    *   (e) determine the appeal by cancelling the decision and referring the application back to the Minister, if he or she made the decision, or the chief executive, in any other case, for correct assessment in terms of the applicable residence instructions, where the Tribunal---
            
        *   (i) considers that the decision appealed against was made on the basis of an incorrect assessment in terms of the residence instructions applicable at the time the application was made; but
        
        *   (ii) is not satisfied that the appellant would, but for that incorrect assessment, have been entitled in terms of those instructions to the visa or entry permission; or
        
        
    
    *   (f) confirm the decision as having been correct in terms of the residence instructions applicable at the time the visa application was made, but recommend that the special circumstances of the applicant are such as to warrant consideration by the Minister as an exception to those instructions.
    
    (2) Where the Tribunal determines to reverse a decision to refuse a visa under subsection (1)(b) or (c), the Tribunal must---
        
    *   (a) consider whether it is appropriate that conditions should be imposed in accordance with [section 50][63] when a resident visa is granted to the appellant; and
    
    *   (b) if it considers that imposing conditions is appropriate, direct the Minister to impose under that section the conditions specified in its decision (which may be specified with the degree of generality or particularity that the Tribunal thinks fit); and
    
    *   (c) notify the appellant in writing of any conditions imposed.
    
    (3) Where the Tribunal refers an application back to the Minister or the chief executive under subsection (1)(e), the Tribunal may give him or her the directions it thinks fit as to how a correct assessment of the application should be carried out.
    
    (4) The Tribunal must, as soon as practicable, notify the appellant in writing of its decision on the appeal and the reasons for that decision.
    
    (5) Subject to [section 245][299], the decision of the Tribunal on the appeal is final, and, except where a court otherwise directs, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to reconsider the appeal after the appellant has been notified of the decision.

##### 189 Use of further information in appeals under section 187
    
*   (1) In determining an appeal under [section 187][232], the Tribunal may not consider any information or evidence adduced by the appellant that was not provided to the Minister or the immigration officer before the time at which the Minister or the officer made the decision that is the subject of the appeal.
    
    (2) Subsection (1) is subject to subsections (3) to (6).
    
    (3) The Tribunal may consider information or evidence not provided by the appellant to the Minister or the immigration officer before the time of the relevant decision if---
        
    *   (a) the Tribunal is satisfied that---
            
        *   (i) the information or evidence existed at the time the decision to refuse the visa was made, and would have been relevant to the making of that decision; and
        
        *   (ii) the appellant could not, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, have placed that information or evidence before the Minister or the immigration officer at the time at which the Minister or the officer made the decision on the application; and
        
        *   (iii) in all the circumstances it is fair to consider the information or evidence; or
        
        
    
    *   (b) the Tribunal considers that it is necessary for it to have the information or evidence for the purpose of considering whether to make a determination under [section 188(1)(f)][233].

    *   (a) the Tribunal considers that the decision under appeal depended, in whole or in part, upon the recorded results of an interview conducted with the appellant or with some other person connected with the application; and
    
    *   (b) those results involved the recording of an exercise of judgment on the part of the interviewing officer as opposed to the recording of facts; and

    *   (b) it would not in all the circumstances be contrary to the public interest to allow the appellant to remain in New Zealand.
    
    (2) In determining whether it would be unjust or unduly harsh to deport from New Zealand an appellant who became liable for deportation under [section 161][199], and whether it would be contrary to the public interest to allow the appellant to remain in New Zealand, the Tribunal must have regard to any submissions of a victim made in accordance with [section 208][257].
    
    Compare: 1987 No 74 [ss 47(3)][723], [105(1A)][724]

##### 208 Right of victims to make submission on appeal

    (4) The Tribunal, or a lawyer or agent acting for the appellant, must, on a request for the purpose, show the appellant a copy of all written submissions made by the victim under [section 173][213] or this section. However, the appellant may not keep a copy of any of those submissions.
    
    (5) Despite subsections (3) and (4), the Tribunal may withhold from the appellant and every lawyer or agent acting for the appellant (if any) either or both of the following if, in the Tribunal's opinion, that withholding is necessary to protect the physical safety or security of the victim concerned:
        
    *   (a) any part of the victim's written submissions under [section 173][213], whether or not that part was withheld by the Minister under section 173(4):

*   (1) Without limiting section 209, if the Tribunal decides that an appeal against liability for deportation should be allowed in the case of a person who is unlawfully in New Zealand or is the holder of a temporary entry class visa, the Tribunal may order an immigration officer to grant the successful appellant---
        
    *   (a) a resident visa subject to such conditions (if any) as the Tribunal determines; or
    
    *   (b) a temporary visa for a period not exceeding 12 months subject to such conditions (if any) as the Tribunal determines.

    (4) To avoid doubt, the Tribunal may order an immigration officer to grant a visa, and the officer must grant the visa, even though the person would normally be prohibited from being granted a visa under [section 15][19] or [16][20].
    
    (5) If the Tribunal orders the imposition of any condition on a visa,---

    (3) If the appellant is subject to residence or reporting requirements under [section 315][382], an immigration officer must immediately notify, in writing, the appellant (and, if applicable, his or her guarantor) that the appellant's liability for deportation is cancelled, and the appellant ceases to be subject to those requirements.
    
    (4) If the appellant has been released on conditions under [section 320][388], an immigration officer must immediately notify, in writing, the appellant that his or her liability for deportation is cancelled, and the appellant ceases to be subject to those conditions.

    (3) If the Tribunal determines that the person has failed to comply with any condition,---

    *   (b) the person has 28 days from the date the notice is served to leave New Zealand before he or she may be deported.
    
    (4) In the case of a person in imprisonment, the period referred to in subsection (1) commences on the date of the person's release from imprisonment.

    Compare: 1987 No 74 [s 75][776]

##### 315 Person may instead agree to residence and reporting requirements
    
*   (1) Rather than causing a person who is liable for arrest and detention to be arrested under [section 313][380], or making an application for a warrant of commitment under [section 316][384], an immigration officer and the person liable for arrest and detention may agree that the person will do all or any of the following things:

    (3) An immigration officer may at any time vary any residence or reporting requirements under this section at the request or with the agreement of the person.
    
    (4) The agreement or variation of any residence or reporting requirements must be in writing and must---
        
    *   (a) list any requirements agreed under subsection (1) or (3); and
    
    *   (b) include a warning that, if the person fails to comply with any agreed requirement, the person may be detained under [section 312][379] or arrested and detained under [section 313][380].
    
    (5) An immigration officer may at any time, in the officer's absolute discretion, decide to end any agreement made under subsection (1).
    
    (6) A person may be detained under [section 312][379] or arrested and detained under [section 313][380]---
        
    *   (a) if an immigration officer determines that the person, without reasonable excuse,---
            
        *   (i) has failed to reside at the specified place; or
        
        *   (ii) has failed to comply with other agreed requirements; or
        
        
    
    *   (b) if an immigration officer ends an agreement under subsection (5); or
    
    *   (c) in order to execute a deportation order or place the person on the first available craft leaving New Zealand.

#### Warrants of commitment

##### 316 Application for warrant of commitment
    
*   (1) An immigration officer may apply to a District Court Judge for a warrant of commitment (or a further warrant of commitment) authorising a person's detention for up to 28 days in any case where it becomes apparent, in the case of a person detained in custody under this Part, that before the expiry of the period for which detention is authorised---
        
    *   (a) there will not be, or there is unlikely to be, a craft available to take the person from New Zealand; or
    
    *   (b) the person will not, or is unlikely to, supply satisfactory evidence of his or her identity; or

    *   (d) the person has not supplied satisfactory evidence of his or her identity.

    (4) In determining whether to issue a warrant of commitment, or whether to order the person's release on conditions, the Judge must have regard to, among other things, the need to seek an outcome that maximises compliance with this Act.
    
    (5) Unless there are exceptional circumstances, the Judge must not release the person on conditions if---
        
    *   (a) the identity of the person is unknown; or
    
    *   (b) the person's identity has not been established to the satisfaction of the court; or

## Schedule 1  
Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees

[ss 127(3)][160], [165][203]

## Done at Geneva on 28 July 1951[1][858]

Entry into force: 22 April 1954, in accordance with Article 43

Text: United Nations Treaty Series No. 2545, Vol. 189, p. 137

#### PREAMBLE

##### The High Contracting Parties

_Considering_ that the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights approved on 10 December 1948 by the General Assembly have affirmed the principle that human beings shall enjoy fundamental rights and freedoms without discrimination.

_Considering_ that the United Nations has, on various occasions, manifested its profound concern for refugees and endeavoured to assure refugees the widest possible exercise of these fundamental rights and freedoms.

_Considering_ that it is desirable to revise and consolidate previous international agreements relating to the status of refugees and to extend the scope of and the protection accorded by such instruments by means of a new agreement.

_Considering_ that the grant of asylum may place unduly heavy burdens on certain countries, and that a satisfactory solution of a problem of which the United Nations has recognized the international scope and nature cannot therefore be achieved without international co-operation.

_Expressing_ the wish that all States, recognizing the social and humanitarian nature of the problem of refugees, will do everything within their power to prevent this problem from becoming a cause of tension between States.

_Noting_ that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is charged with the task of supervising international conventions providing for the protection of refugees, and recognizing that the effective co-ordination of measures taken to deal with this problem will depend upon the co-operation of States with the High Commissioner.

_Have agreed as follows:_

#### CHAPTER I

Definition of the term ""Refugee""
    
*   A. For the purposes of the present Convention, the term ""refugee"" shall apply to any person who:

*   (1) Has been considered a refugee under the Arrangements of 12 May 1926 and 30 June 1928 or under the Conventions of 28 October 1933 and 10 February 1938, the Protocol of 14 September 1939 or the Constitution of the International Refugee Organization:
    
    Decisions of non-eligibility taken by the International Refugee Organization during the period of its activities shall not prevent the status of refugee being accorded to persons who fulfil the conditions of paragraph 2 of this section:

*   (2) As a result of events occurring before 1 January 1951 and owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country: or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it.
    
    In the case of a person who has more than one nationality, the term ""the country of his nationality"" shall mean each of the countries of which he is a national, and a person shall not be deemed to be lacking the protection of the country of his nationality if, without any valid reason based on well-founded fear, he has not availed himself of the protection of one of the countries of which he is a national.

*   B. (1) For the purposes of this Convention, the words ""events occurring before 1 January 1951"" in Article 1, Section A, shall be understood to mean either:
        
    *   (a) ""events occurring in Europe before 1 January 1951""; or
    
    *   (b) ""events occurring in Europe or elsewhere before 1 January 1951"",
    
    and each Contracting State shall make a declaration at the time of signature, ratification or accession, specifying which of these meanings it applies for the purpose of its obligations under this Convention.[2][859]

*   (2) Any Contracting State which has adopted alternative _(a)_ may at any time extend its obligations by adopting alternative _(b)_ by means of a notification addressed to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.

*   C. This Convention shall cease to apply to any person falling under the terms of section A if:

*   (1) He has voluntarily re-availed himself of the protection of the country of his nationality; or

*   (2) Having lost his nationality, he has voluntarily re-acquired it; or

*   (3) He has acquired a new nationality, and enjoys the protection of the country of his new nationality; or

*   (4) He has voluntarily re-established himself in the country which he left or outside which he remained owing to fear of persecution; or

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Immigration Act 2009\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 October 2012, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][992] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][993] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][994] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][995] and [17E][996] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
