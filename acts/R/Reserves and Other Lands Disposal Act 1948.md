*   Whereas the land described in subsection (3) was formerly vested in the Otago Harbour Board (in this section referred to as the **Board**) in trust for the improvement of the harbour of Dunedin:
    
    And whereas by a Proclamation dated 21 October 1948, issued under the Public Works Act 1928 and published in the _Gazette_ of 28 October, the said land was taken for a public work, and as from 1 November 1948 vested in His Majesty the King for that purpose:
    
    And whereas the amount of compensation to be paid to the Board by the Minister of Works for the loss of the said land has not yet been settled, but it has been arranged between the Board and the said Minister that any sum so payable shall be paid directly to the Board and form part of the endowment fund of the Board:
    
    And whereas it is desirable that the said arrangement should be validated:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 92 of the Public Works Act 1928 or of any other enactment it shall be lawful for the Minister of Works to pay directly to the Board any compensation moneys that are payable to the Board for the taking for a public work of the land more particularly described in subsection (3) of this section.
    
    (2) The compensation moneys paid to the Board under the authority of the last preceding subsection shall be paid into and form part of the endowment fund of the Board created by a declaration of trust made by the Board and bearing date 19 November 1942 for the improvement of the harbour of Dunedin.
    
    (3) The land to which this section relates is particularly described as follows:
    
    All that area of land in the Otago Land District, City of Dunedin, containing 3 roods 11 perches and six-hundredths of a perch, more or less, being Sections 30, 31, 32, 33, and 34 on a plan deposited in the Land Registry Office at Dunedin under Number 2769, Block LXXIV, Town of Dunedin, and being part of the land comprised and described in certificate of title, Volume 184, folio 214, Otago Registry: as the same is more particularly delineated on the plan marked PWD 127808, deposited in the Office of the Minister of Works, at Wellington, and thereon coloured blue.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Reserves and Other Lands Disposal Act 1948\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 19 November 1981, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][49] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][50] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][51] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][52] and [17E][53] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
