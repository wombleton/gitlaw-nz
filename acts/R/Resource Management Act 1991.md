    and the local authority may fix different charges for different costs it incurs in the performance of its various functions, powers, and duties under this Act---
        
    *   (c) in relation to different areas or different classes of applicant, consent holder, requiring authority, or heritage protection authority; or
    
    *   (d) where any activity undertaken by the persons liable to pay any charge reduces the cost to the local authority of carrying out any of its functions, powers, and duties.
    
    (5) A local authority may, in any particular case and in its absolute discretion, remit the whole or any part of any charge of a kind referred to in this section which would otherwise be payable.

    (3) A rule or resource consent may not be more lenient than a national environmental standard.
    
    (4) For the purposes of subsection (3), a rule or resource consent is more lenient than a standard if it permits or authorises an activity that the standard prohibits or restricts.

    *   (b) includes rules in the plan about the quality of water in those waters,---
    
    the rules shall require the observance of the standards specified in that schedule in respect of the appropriate class or classes unless, in the council's opinion, those standards are not adequate or appropriate in respect of those waters in which case the rules may state standards that are more stringent or specific.
    
    (2) Where a regional council provides in a plan that certain waters are to be managed for any purpose for which the classes specified in [Schedule 3][907] are not adequate or appropriate, the council may state in the plan new classes and standards about the quality of water in those waters.
    
    (3) Subject to the need to allow for reasonable mixing of a discharged contaminant or water, a regional council shall not set standards in a plan which result, or may result, in a reduction of the quality of the water in any waters at the time of the public notification of the proposed plan unless it is consistent with the purpose of this Act to do so.

##### 70 Rules about discharges
    
*   (1) Before a regional council includes in a regional plan a rule that allows as a permitted activity---
        
    *   (a) a discharge of a contaminant or water into water; or
    
    *   (b) a discharge of a contaminant onto or into land in circumstances which may result in that contaminant (or any other contaminant emanating as a result of natural processes from that contaminant) entering water,---
    
    the regional council shall be satisfied that none of the following effects are likely to arise in the receiving waters, after reasonable mixing, as a result of the discharge of the contaminant (either by itself or in combination with the same, similar, or other contaminants):
        
    *   (c) the production of conspicuous oil or grease films, scums or foams, or floatable or suspended materials:
    
    *   (d) any conspicuous change in the colour or visual clarity:

    *   (f) the rendering of fresh water unsuitable for consumption by farm animals:
    
    *   (g) any significant adverse effects on aquatic life.
    
    (2) Before a regional council includes in a regional plan a rule requiring the adoption of the best practicable option to prevent or minimise any actual or likely adverse effect on the environment of any discharge of a contaminant, the regional council shall be satisfied that, having regard to---
        
    *   (a) the nature of the discharge and the receiving environment; and
    
    *   (b) other alternatives, including a rule requiring the observance of minimum standards of quality of the environment,---
    
    the inclusion of that rule in the plan is the most efficient and effective means of preventing or minimising those adverse effects on the environment.

##### 138A Special provisions relating to coastal permits for dumping and incineration
    
*   (1) Without limiting [section 104][264], when considering an application for a coastal permit to do something that would otherwise contravene [section 15A(1)][33], the consent authority shall, in having regard to the actual and potential effects of allowing the activity, have regard to---
        
    *   (a) the nature of any discharge of any contaminant which the dumping or incineration may involve and the sensitivity of the receiving environment to adverse effects and the applicant's reasons for making the proposed choice; and
    
    *   (b) any possible alternative methods of disposal or combustion including any involving discharge into any other receiving environment,---
    
    and, without limiting the powers of the consent authority under [section 92][230], it may, at any reasonable time before the hearing (or, if there is no hearing, the determination) of the application, by written notice to the applicant, require the applicant to provide, by way of further information, an explanation of those matters.
    
    (2) Without limiting [section 108][282], but subject to subsection (5), a coastal permit to which subsection (1) applies may include a condition requiring the holder to adopt the best practicable option to prevent or minimise any actual or likely adverse effect on the environment of any discharge of any contaminant which may occur in the exercise of the permit; provided that before a consent authority decides to grant a coastal permit subject to such a condition, it shall be satisfied that, in the particular circumstances, and having regard to---
        
    *   (a) the nature of any discharge of a contaminant and the receiving environment; and
    
    *   (b) other alternatives, including any condition requiring the observance of minimum standards of quality of the receiving environment,---
    
    the inclusion of the condition is the most efficient and effective means of preventing or minimising any actual or likely adverse effect on the environment.
    
    (3) In respect of a coastal permit to do something that would otherwise contravene [section 15A(1)][33], a consent authority may, at any time specified for that purpose in the permit, in accordance with [section 129][315], serve notice on the holder of the permit of its intention to review the conditions of the permit for the purpose of requiring the holder to adopt the best practicable option to remove or reduce any adverse effect on the environment.
    
    (4) Subject to subsection (5), [sections 129 to 133][315] shall apply to any review of a coastal permit under subsection (3) and the powers conferred on a consent authority by that subsection are in addition to the powers conferred by [section 128][314].
    
    (5) Before deciding to grant a coastal permit subject to a condition described in subsection (2) and before deciding to change the conditions of a coastal permit pursuant to subsections (3) and (4), the consent authority shall be satisfied, in the particular circumstances, and having regard to---
        
    *   (a) the nature of any discharge of a contaminant and the receiving environment; and
    
    *   (b) the financial implications for the holder of including that condition; and
    
    *   (c) other alternatives, including a condition requiring the observance of minimum standards of quality of the receiving environment---
    
    that including a condition in the permit requiring the holder to adopt the best practicable option to remove or reduce any adverse effect on the environment is the most efficient and effective means of removing or reducing that adverse effect.
    
    (6) In every coastal permit to do something that would otherwise contravene [section 15A(1)][33], there shall be implied a condition that the holder shall, in the prescribed form and at the cost of the holder in all respects, keep such records and furnish to the Director of Maritime New Zealand such information and returns as may from time to time be required by regulations.

#### Decisions on proposals of national significance

\[Repealed\]
    
*   Heading: repealed, on 1 October 2009, by [section 100][1405] of the Resource Management (Simplifying and Streamlining) Amendment Act 2009 (2009 No 31).

Proposals of national significance
    
*   Part 6AA: inserted, on 1 October 2009, by [section 100][1405] of the Resource Management (Simplifying and Streamlining) Amendment Act 2009 (2009 No 31).

##### 140 Outline of this Part
    
*   (1) This section sets out the general scheme and effect of this Part. This section is by way of explanation only and does not limit or affect the other provisions of this Part or this Act.
    
    (2) This Part provides the Minister with specific powers in relation to applications for resource consents, applications for changes to or cancellation of resource consent conditions, local authority plan changes or variations, requests for plan changes, requests for the preparation of regional plans, and notices of requirement that are or are part of a proposal of national significance.
    
    (3) If exercised by the Minister, these powers set in motion one of 2 procedures by which the application, change, variation, request, or notice (**the matter**) is decided. Instead of the normal procedures set out in the Act, either a board of inquiry or the Environment Court decides the matter. A decision by a board of inquiry or the Environment Court may be challenged only by an appeal to the High Court on a question of law. If that decision is challenged, a further appeal may be taken to the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeal on a question of law, but only with the leave of the Supreme Court.
    
    (4) There are 3 ways in which a matter may come to the Minister for his or her decision on whether to make a direction to refer a matter to a board of inquiry or the Environment Court for decision. If the matter has been lodged with a local authority, the Minister may decide to make a direction on his or her own initiative or in response to a request from the local authority or the applicant. If the matter has been lodged with the Environmental Protection Authority, the Minister may decide to make a direction after receiving a recommendation from the EPA.
    
    (5) If the Minister decides not to make a direction to refer a matter to a board of inquiry or the Environment Court for decision, the matter will be processed by the local authority that, in the normal course of the Act, would be responsible for dealing with it. However, the Minister may still intervene in the process, for example, by making a submission on the matter for the Crown, appointing a project co-ordinator to advise the local authority on any thing relating to the matter, or appointing an additional hearings commissioner.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Resource Management Act 1991\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 24 May 2013, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][2018] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][2019] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][2020] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][2021] and [17E][2022] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
