##### 3 Lessees of Crown lands in Rotorua may acquire fee-simple
    
*   (1) The lessee of any Crown lands described in Schedule [1][22] or Schedule [2][23] hereto may at any time during the currency of the lease purchase the fee-simple of the land comprised therein at a price ascertained and determined in the manner hereinafter provided.
    
    (2) The right of purchase hereby conferred shall be exercised by the lessee giving to the Commissioner notice of his intention to purchase.
    
    (3) The delivery of the notice to the Commissioner shall constitute a contract between the lessee and the Crown for the purchase and sale of the land.
    
    (4) The lessee shall in the notice notify whether he elects to purchase for cash or upon deferred payments.

##### 4 Valuation to be made of Crown's interest in reversion
    
*   (1) The Valuer-General shall, on application in that behalf by the Commissioner, cause a valuation to be made in accordance with the provisions of the [Rating Valuations Act 1998][26], of the capital value of the land comprised in the lease as at the date of the notice of the lessee's intention to purchase the fee-simple, and also of any improvements effected by the lessee and of any other improvements to which the lessee is entitled.
    
    (2) From the capital value ascertained by such valuation there shall be deducted the value of the improvements aforesaid. The resulting sum is hereinafter referred to as the present unimproved value.
    
    Provided that the lessee shall have the same right of objection to a valuation made pursuant to subsection [(1)][4] of this section as he would have in respect of a valuation made under the [Rating Valuations Act 1998][26]; and where, pursuant to any such objection, the appropriate Land Valuation Tribunal has determined a new value for the capital value of or improvements on the land or both, the present unimproved value shall be calculated accordingly.
    
    (3) For the purposes of this section the annual rent reserved by the lease shall be deemed to be five per centum of the original unimproved value of the land comprised in the lease, and the original unimproved value shall be determined accordingly.
    
    (4) In no case shall the present unimproved value be less than the original unimproved value.
    
    (5) An actuarial computation shall be made of the present value of the Crown's interest in the land. The rate of interest for the purpose of such computation shall be five per centum per annum, payable half-yearly.
    
    (6) The present value of the rent for the unexpired period of the term of the lease shall be ascertained by actuarial computation, and the rate of interest for such computation shall be five per centum per annum, payable half-yearly.
    
    The proviso to subsection (2) was inserted, as from 23 December 1977, by section 2(1) Rotorua Town Lands Amendment Act 1977 (1977 No 174).
    
    References to Rating Valuations Act 1998, being the corresponding enactment, were substituted for references to Valuation of Land Act 1951, as from 1 July 1998, by section [53][27] Rating Valuations Act 1998 (1998 No 69).
    
    The Valuation of Land Act 1925 was substituted, as from 1 April 1926, for a reference to the Valuation of Land Act 1908 by section 60 Valuation of Land Act 1925 (1925 No 31). This reference was in turn substituted, as from 1 January 1952, by a reference to the Valuation of Land Act 1951 by section 50(1) Valuation of Land Act 1951 (1951 No 19).

##### 5 Computation of the price

*   If the lessee elects to purchase for cash, he shall, within six months after the date of a notice signed by the Commissioner fixing the price ascertained as aforesaid, pay the price, together with all rent accrued and accruing due under the lease up to the date of the delivery of the notice of intention to purchase, and also interest at five per centum per annum on the price from that date to the date of payment, and upon such payments being made in full the purchase shall be deemed to have been completed.

##### 7 Purchase on deferred payments
    
*   If the lessee elects to purchase upon deferred payments,---

    *   (d) The first annual instalment of the price shall be payable on the first day of January or the first day of July, as the case may be, after the expiration of twelve months from the date of notice from the Commissioner as provided for in the last preceding section, and the succeeding instalments shall be payable on the same day in each year thereafter.
    
    *   (e) The first payment of interest shall be payable on the first day of January or the first day of July, as the case may be, after the expiration of six months from the date of the notice from the Commissioner as aforesaid, and the succeeding half-yearly payments shall be payable on each first day of January and July thereafter.
    
    *   (f) The license to occupy shall be in the prescribed form, and shall contain such provisions for the forfeiture of the right and interest of the licensee in the event of his failure to pay any instalment of the price or to make any payment of interest as may be prescribed, and the right of the licensee shall be subject accordingly to the provisions of the said license.

    The words ""ten dollars"" were substituted, as from 10 July 1967, for the words ""five pounds"" pursuant to section [7(1)][29] Decimal Currency Act 1964 (1964 No 27).

##### 9 Computation of price to be made by Commissioner

    *   (a) The lessee shall continue to hold the balance of the land comprised in the lease on the same terms and conditions as those upon which he held the land comprised in the original lease, save that the rent payable under the lease shall be proportionately abated.
    
    *   (b) A plan of the part proposed to be acquired shall be submitted to the Commissioner for his approval, and such approval shall be given only in cases where the Commissioner is satisfied that the interest of the Crown in the balance of the land will not be injuriously affected by the severance.
