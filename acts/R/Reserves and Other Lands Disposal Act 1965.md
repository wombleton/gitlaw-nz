*   Whereas [section 21][20] of the Reserves and Other Lands Disposal Act 1956 abolished the Foxton Harbour Board (in this section referred to as the **Board**) and provided for the disposition of the Board's endowment land and other assets: 
    
    And whereas by subsection (4) of the said section certain endowment land was vested in the Chairman, Councillors, and Inhabitants of the County of Manawatu (in this section referred to as the **Corporation**) subject to the provisions of that section:
    
    And whereas part of the endowment land was vested in the Corporation subject to certain leases granted by the Board:
    
    And whereas the Maori owners of the Papangaio J Block (in this section referred to as the **owners**) had for many years contended that some of those leases had been granted over land that was part of Papangaio J Block and over land that was an accretion to that Block: 
    
    And whereas subsection (6) of the said section provided that if the Maori Land Court found that any portion of the endowment area was an accretion to Papangaio J Block over which title should be granted to the owners of that block that portion should thereupon cease to be subject to the provisions of the section and the Minister of Lands was empowered to vary the terms on which the endowment was vested in the Corporation: 
    
    And whereas the Maori Land Court investigated the ownership of the disputed land and, upon appeal to the Maori Appellate Court, it was found that the land firstly and secondly described in subsection (9) was an accretion to Papangaio J Block over which title should be granted to the owners of that block: 
    
    And whereas it has been established that some of the leases granted by the Board include land that is part of the Papangaio J Block: 
    
    And whereas it is desirable that the land firstly and secondly described in subsection (9) be acquired from the owners to preserve the status and leases of the endowment: 
    
    And whereas it is also desirable that the Crown should acquire the interests of the owners in the land thirdly, fourthly, and fifthly described in subsection (9): 
    
    And whereas it is also considered desirable that the Crown should compensate the owners for any adverse occupation under the aforesaid leases or otherwise of any part or parts of Papangaio J Block or of the land firstly and secondly described in subsection (9): 
    
    And whereas the owners, by their legal representatives, have agreed to accept the sum of 20,000 pounds in full and final settlement of all their rights and claims whatsoever in respect of the land described in subsection (9): 
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    (1) All rights and claims by the owners of Papangaio J Block in respect of title to, trespass over, and adverse occupation of, the land described in subsection (9) are hereby extinguished.
    
    (2) The sum of 20,000 pounds, which has been appropriated by Parliament for the purpose of compensating the aforesaid owners shall be paid to the Maori Trustee who, without further authority than this subsection and subject to the provisions of subsection (3), shall distribute the sum without deduction to the persons entitled thereto in full satisfaction of all claims and rights whatsoever in respect of the land described in subsection (9).
    
    (3) The Maori Land Court may, on the application of any person interested made not later than 6 months after the date of the passing of this Act, order payment from the compensation sum to any owner or other person of such sum as the court deems reasonable in reimbursement of expenses incurred or loss of wages suffered incidental to the investigation of the ownership of the endowment area.
    
    (4) The land firstly and secondly described in subsection (9) is hereby declared to be vested in the Corporation as an endowment subject to the provisions of [section 21][20] of the Reserves and Other Lands Disposal Act 1956 and subject also to all leases, liens, encumbrances, easements, and other restrictions heretofore affecting the land.
    
    (5) The land thirdly, fourthly, and fifthly described in subsection (9) is hereby vested in Her Majesty the Queen subject to the [Land Act 1948][14] and subject to any leases granted by the Foxton Harbour Board pursuant to the Foxton Harbour Board Act 1908 in respect of the land thirdly described.
    
    (6) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Act or rule of law, all leases granted before the passing of this Act by the Corporation under the powers vested in it, and by the Foxton Harbour Board pursuant to the Foxton Harbour Board Act 1908, over the land firstly, secondly, and thirdly described in subsection (9) shall be deemed to be, and to have always been, valid and shall have full force and effect according to their tenor.
    
    (7) The District Land Registrar for the Wellington Land Registration District is hereby authorised to make such entries in the land register as may be necessary to give effect to the provisions of this section and, on application being made to him in that behalf and on payment of such fees as are appropriate, to issue a certificate of title to the Corporation as registered proprietor of the land firstly and secondly described in subsection (9).
    
    (8) The Registrar of the Ikaroa District of the Maori Land Court at Palmerston North is hereby authorised to make such entries in his records as may be necessary to give effect to the provisions of this section.

    Firstly, all that area in the Wellington Land District containing 24 acres and 10 perches, more or less, being part Section 6, Block I, Moutere Survey District; as more particularly shown on SO Plan 26064, lodged in the office of the Chief Surveyor at Wellington, and thereon coloured sepia.

##### 10 Closing the Methodist burial ground at Pakuranga and authorising the trustees to transfer the land to the Corporation of the City of Manukau to be held as a historic reserve
    
*   Whereas the land described in subsection (4) is vested in certain trustees (in this section referred to as the **trustees**) under the Methodist Model Deed of New Zealand 1887: 
    
    And whereas the said land is the site of a Methodist church and burial ground: 
    
    And whereas the church is no longer used and the trustees desire to close the burial ground and transfer the said land to the Mayor, Councillors, and Citizens of the City of Manukau (in this section referred to as the **Corporation**) to be held as a historic reserve: 
    
    And whereas the Corporation is prepared to accept the land as a historic reserve and the trustees' proposals for the preservation of the land and church: 
    
    And whereas doubts have arisen as to whether the trustees have power to transfer the land to the Corporation: 
    
    And whereas it is desirable that the burial ground be closed and that provision be made authorising the transfer of land to the Corporation to be held as a historic reserve subject to the Reserves and Domains Act 1953: 
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    (1) The burial ground on the land described in subsection (4) shall, as from the date of the passing of this Act, be deemed to be closed in accordance with the provisions of the [Burial and Cremation Act 1964][21] and, notwithstanding anything in [sections 41][22] and [42][23] of that Act, no further burials shall take place therein.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Reserves and Other Lands Disposal Act 1965\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 10 December 1976, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][25] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][26] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][27] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][28] and [17E][29] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
