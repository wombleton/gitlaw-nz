##### Notes


###### 1 General
    
*   
    
    This is a reprint of the Reserves and Other Lands Disposal
    Act 1998\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as
    at 25 January 2005, as specified in the list of amendments at
    the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain
    transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled
    in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in
    chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][27] ![](/images/external_link.gif).
    



###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   
    
    Under [section 16D][28] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints
    are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the
    law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that
    enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes
    authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have
    been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official
    volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal
    enactment and its amendments are contained.
    



###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   
    
    A number of editorial conventions are followed in the
    preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included
    in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted.
    For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][29] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts
    and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in
    Force_.
    



###### 4 Changes made under section
17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   
    
    [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises
    the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][30] and [17E][31] of that Act so that,
    to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment
    is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes
    that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January
    2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since
    1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations
    Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January
    2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting
    practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under
    the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are
    set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the
    preparation of this reprint:
    
        
    *   
        
        •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   
        
        •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   
        
        •layout of provisions, including:
            
            
        *   
            
            •indentation
        *   
            
            •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear
            above the section)
            
        
        
    *   
        
        •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type,
        without quotation marks)
    *   
        
        •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   
        
        •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page
        of each Act)
    *   
        
        •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
        
    *   
        
        •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals,
        and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   
        
        •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
            
        *   
            
            •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared
            with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are
            amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word
            (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   
            
            •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now
            capital letters
            
        
        
    *   
        
        •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule),
        and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   
        
        •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   
        
        •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules
        of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather
        than chronological).
