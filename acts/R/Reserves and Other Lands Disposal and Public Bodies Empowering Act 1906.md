An Act to provide for the Exchange, Sale, Reservation, and other Disposition of certain Reserves, Crown Lands, other Lands, and Endowments, and to confer certain Powers on certain Public Bodies.

BE IT ENACTED by the General Assembly of New Zealand in Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:---

##### 1 Short Title
    
*   The Short Title of this Act is The Reserves and other Lands Disposal and Public Bodies Empowering Act 1906\.

##### 2 Transfer to Pacific Cable Board authorised
    
*   Whereas an area of land in the Auckland Land District, containing by admeasurement fifteen acres two roods sixteen perches, more or less, situated in Block IV, Mangonui Survey District, and more particularly described in the _Gazette_ of the twelfth day of December, one thousand nine hundred and one, on page 2356, as temporarily reserved as a site for a cable-station, was by warrant appearing in the _Gazette_ of the thirteenth day of February, one thousand nine hundred and two, permanently reserved for the said purpose: And whereas the Board of Management of the Pacific Cable have paid the sum of sixty-four dollars for the said land, and cleared and fenced the same, and desire to erect buildings thereon, but the land being a reserve cannot be granted to the said Board: Be it therefore enacted as follows:---
    
    The reservation of the aforesaid land is hereby cancelled, and the Governor is hereby authorised and empowered to execute a warrant for the issue of a Land Transfer certificate of title to the Board of Management of the Pacific Cable (known as the Pacific Cable Board) in lieu thereof.
    
    The expression ""sixty-four dollars"" was substituted, as from 10 July 1967, for the expression ""thirty-two pounds"" pursuant to section [7(1)][99] Decimal Currency Act 1964 (1964 No 27).

##### 3 Recreation-ground, Kohukohu
    
*   Whereas Thomas Hartley, William Brownlee, and Alfred Cook Yarborough, as trustees for the inhabitants of Kohukohu, were by Order in Council published in the _Gazette_ of the eighteenth day of March, one thousand eight hundred and ninety seven, licensed to occupy a portion of the foreshore of the Hokianga Harbour, in the Auckland Land District, in order to use the same as a recreation-ground and to erect a wall round a portion thereof to keep the water out: And whereas the present trustees and the inhabitants of the Town of Kohukohu have expended money thereon and are now desirous of having the said land, containing ten acres, more or less, reserved for public recreation and brought under the provisions of [Reserves Act 1977][100] but it being a portion of the foreshore and subject to Harbours Act 1950 there is no power to give effect to their request: Be it therefore enacted as follows:---
    
    The Governor is hereby authorised and empowered to have a survey made of the said land, and, after a plan thereof has been approved by the Minister of Marine, to reserve the same by notice in the _Gazette_ for purposes of public recreation, and by subsequent Order in Council may bring it under the provisions of [Reserves Act 1977][100].
    
    The reference to the Public Domains Act 1881 was substituted, as from 4 August 1908 pursuant to section 1(2) Public Reserves and Domains Act 1908 (1908 No 156). That reference was in turn substituted, as from 1 April 1929, by a reference to the Public Reserves, Domains, and National Parks Act 1928 pursuant to section 103 Public Reserves, Domains, and National Parks Act 1928 (1928 No 36). That reference was in turn substituted, as from 1 April 1954, by a reference to the Reserves and Domains Act 1953 pursuant to section 107(1) Reserves and Domains Act 1953 (1953 No 69). That reference was in turn substituted, as from 1 April 1978, by a reference to the Reserves Act 1977 pursuant to section [125(1)][101] Reserves Act 1977 (1977 No 66).
    
    The reference to the Harbours Act 1878 was consolidated, as from 4 August 1908, by section 1(2) Harbours Act 1908 (1908 No 75).

*   Whereas the Auckland Land Board approved on the twenty-sixth day of April, one thousand nine hundred and six, of an application to transfer lease in perpetuity No 1295 over Section No 8, Block IX, Opuawhanga Survey District, in the Auckland Land District, containing forty acres two roods sixteen perches, from Nils August Nilson to David Brien, of Marua, settler, for the sum of forty dollars: And whereas the said David Brien states that he is unable to complete the transfer owing to the absence of the said Nils August Nilson in Norway: Be it therefore enacted as follows:---
    
    The District Land Registrar of the Auckland Land Registration District is hereby empowered to accept and register a transfer of the said lease, signed by the Commissioner of Crown Lands for the Auckland Land District, in favour of the said David Brien.
    
    The expression ""forty dollars"" was substituted, as from 10 July 1967, for the expression to ""twenty pounds sterling"" pursuant to section [7(1)][99] Decimal Currency Act 1964 (1964 No 27).

##### 5 Mrs ME Beale's claim for a land order, Auckland
    
*   The Governor may authorise the Commissioner of Crown Lands for the Auckland Land District to inquire into the claim of Mary Eleanor Beale, as administratrix of her husband's estate, for a grant of two hundred and twenty acres of land under The Auckland Waste Lands Act 1858, and, if he is satisfied that such claim has not been satisfied, may authorise a land order to be issued in satisfaction of such claim, which order may be exercised not later than the first day of January, one thousand nine hundred and eight.

##### 6 Exchange with Auckland Agricultural and Pastoral Association
    
*   Whereas the land described in Part [1][102] of Schedule 1 hereto was granted to the Auckland Agricultural and Pastoral Association under section [forty-nine][103] of The [Reserves and other Lands Sale, Disposal, and Enabling and Public Bodies Empowering Act 1901][104], subject to certain conditions, and it has been agreed to exchange the said land for land described in Part [2][105] of Schedule 1 hereto, being land acquired under The Land for Settlements Consolidation Act 1900: And whereas the exchange is for the mutual advantage of the Government and the said association: Be it therefore enacted as follows:---
        
    *   (a) The Governor may grant the land described in Part [2][105] of Schedule 1 hereto to the Auckland Agricultural and Pastoral Association, subject to the provisions of The Agricultural and Pastoral Societies Act 1877, in exchange for the land described in Part [1][102] of Schedule 1 hereto, which shall be deemed to be land acquired under The Land for Settlements Consolidation Act 1900\.
    
    *   (b) Section [forty-nine][103] of The [Reserves and other Lands Sale, Disposal, and Enabling and Public Bodies Empowering Act 1901][104], is hereby repealed.
    
    

##### 7 Alteration of line of bridge across Symonds Street Cemetery, Auckland
    
*   Whereas by The Auckland Cemetery Bridge and City Borrowing Act 1905, the Auckland City Council was authorised and empowered to erect a bridge across that portion of the Symonds Street Cemetery described in the Schedule thereto, and also to disinter and remove any bodies buried therein: And whereas it has been found expedient to move the centre line of the said bridge a short distance to the southward of the original proposed centre line, and in order to enable the bridge to be erected in the new position it will be necessary to disinter and remove bodies buried in graves other than those included in the above-mentioned portion of the said cemetery: Be it therefore enacted as follows:---
    
    The Auckland City Council is hereby authorised and empowered to disinter and remove bodies from such portion of the said cemetery to the south of the land described in the Schedule to the said Act as shall be considered necessary by such City Council in and about the construction and erection of such bridge according to the centre line as altered, and the provisions of sections two to four of the said Act shall apply thereto accordingly.

##### 8 Addition to Buffalo Domain, Coromandel County
    
*   Whereas Allotment No 31 of the Town of Buffalo, in the Auckland Land District, containing by admeasurement two acres two roods twenty-five perches, more or less, was permanently reserved for hospital purposes in the Auckland Provincial Gazette No 43, of one thousand eight hundred and seventy-two, and by Order in Council in the New Zealand Gazette of the seventeenth day of July, one thousand eight hundred and ninety, was vested in the Coromandel County Council in trust for the said purposes: And whereas the said allotment is not now required for hospital purposes, as the Coromandel Hospital Board has acquired a larger and more suitable site on which it has erected a hospital, and the Coromandel County Council has applied to have the said allotment set apart as an addition to the present Buffalo Domain, but there is no power to give effect to its wishes: Be it therefore enacted as follows:---
    
    The reservation of Allotment No 31, Town of Buffalo, and its vesting in the Coromandel County Council for hospital purposes, are hereby cancelled, and the said allotment is hereby declared to be set apart and reserved as an addition to the Buffalo Domain.

##### 9 Reserves for drill-shed, Courthouse, police-station, and Borough Council, Waihi
    
*   Whereas section numbered 31 of the Town of Waihi, in the Auckland Land District, containing three roods sixteen perches, was by notice in the _Gazette_ of the eleventh day of September, one thousand nine hundred and two, permanently reserved as a site for a Courthouse: And whereas section numbered 32 of the said Town of Waihi, containing one acre, was by the same notice permanently reserved as a site for a police-station: And whereas a portion of the said Section No 31 has since been further reserved as a site for Borough Council buildings, and a certificate of title issued therefor to the Corporation of the Borough of Waihi, and such further reservation was not made in accordance with the provisions of The Public Reserves Act 1881, by a change of purpose as therein prescribed, and it is desired to validate the said reservation for Borough Council buildings, and to set apart a further portion of the said sections numbered 31 and 32 as a site for a drill-shed and other Volunteer purposes: Be it therefore enacted as follows:---
    
    The reservations of Sections Nos 31 and 32 as aforesaid are hereby cancelled, and in lieu thereof the several areas of land described in Schedule [2][78] hereto are set apart as sites for a Volunteer drill-shed, Courthouse, police-station, and Borough Council buildings respectively; and for the purpose of validating the certificate of title issued for the last-mentioned area such reservation shall be deemed to have been made as from the date of the certificate:
    
    Provided that the reserve for a Volunteer drill-shed shall be subject to the provisions of The Volunteer Drill-sheds and Lands Act 1888, and any amendments thereof.

##### 10 Tauranga Showground
    
*   Whereas the piece of land, being allotment numbered 401A in the Parish of Te Papa, in the Auckland Land District, and containing twelve acres, more or less, was, by Order in Council dated the twenty-ninth day of April, one thousand eight hundred and ninety-five, vested or intended to be vested in the Tauranga Farmers' Club and Acclimatisation Society for a show-ground: And whereas such society was at that time an unincorporated body, and no trustees were appointed, and the said Order in Council was inoperative: And whereas the Tauranga Farmers' Club and Acclimatisation Society subsequently became incorporated under The Agricultural and Pastoral Societies Act 1877, under the name of the Tauranga Agricultural and Pastoral Association; and it is expedient that the said piece of land should be legally vested in the said association: Be it therefore enacted as follows:---
    
    The said piece of land is hereby vested in the Tauranga Agricultural and Pastoral Association in trust for show-grounds.

##### 11 School-site reserve, Maketu Survey District
    
*   Whereas Section No 20, Block VIII, Maketu Survey District, containing an area of nineteen acres and thirty perches, was by notice in the _Gazette_ of the thirtieth day of January, one thousand eight hundred and ninety, permanently reserved as a school-site, under the control of the Education Board of the District of Auckland: And whereas the School Commissioners of the Provincial District of Auckland have in error leased the same by public tender to JA McGhie, and it is desirable that such lease should be validated: And whereas in order to do so it is necessary that the purpose of the reserve be changed, and that the land be placed under the control of the School Commissioners for the Provincial District of Auckland: And whereas the said land is not required by the Education Board as a school-site: Be it therefore enacted as follows:---
    
    Section No 20, Block VIII, Maketu Survey District, is hereby changed from a reserve as a school-site under the control of the Education Board of the District of Auckland to that of a reserve for primary education under the control and administration of the School Commissioners of the Provincial District of Auckland; and, for the purpose of validating the said lease, such change shall be deemed to have been made from the date of the lease.

    (2) All acts and proceedings, including the imposition and levy of dues and fees, done and taken heretofore under the said by-laws are hereby confirmed and validated; but this shall not affect any proceedings taken in any Court of justice or any action now pending.

##### 13 Reserve for drill-shed, Cambridge East

    Sections Nos 28 and 29, Town of Cambridge East, are hereby changed from a reserve for police purposes to that of a reserve for a drill-shed and other Volunteer purposes, subject to the provisions of The Volunteer Drill-sheds and Lands Act 1888, and any amendment thereof.

##### 14 Road on bank of Waikato River may be closed and other road provided
    
*   Whereas the road described in Schedule [3][79] hereto (hereinafter termed **the original road**) was laid off near the bank of the Waikato River to give access to the sections through which it passes, but owing to its low and swampy position it cannot be constructed as a road throughout its entire length, and considerable deviations parallel and close to the original road have been laid off and constructed on higher and drier ground, and it is desirable to close the parts of the original road not now required; but whereas, owing to the washing-away of the river-bank, some parts of the original road now touch the river, and the road is therefore held to be a river-bank road within the meaning of section one hundred and twenty-nine of The Public Works Act 1905, and such road cannot be closed: Be it therefore enacted as follows:---
    
    His Excellency the Governor in Council is hereby authorised to close such parts of the original road as are not now required; and the Raglan County Council may thereupon dispose of the land comprised in such closed road in the manner provided by The Public Works Act 1905\.

##### 15 Power to lease reserve sections, Patetere Survey District
    
*   The Land Board of the Auckland Land District may lease the sections enumerated in Schedule [4][80] hereto, which have been set apart as a **sanatorium** for cattle suffering from the **bush sickness,** for any term not exceeding fourteen years, and subject to such conditions as to occupation and cultivation thereof as the Minister approves:
    
    Provided that all substantial improvements of a permanent character effected by the lessee of any such section during the term of his lease shall, in accordance with the provisions of sections seventy-two to seventy-seven inclusive of The Land Act 1892, be valued at the termination of the lease of such land and paid over to the outgoing lessee by the incoming lessee as therein provided.

##### 16 Transfer of lease, Midgley to Clark, validated
    
*   Whereas Section No 21, Block X, Patetere Survey District, in the Auckland Land District, containing one thousand and sixty-five acres, more or less, was allotted in December, one thousand nine hundred and five, on the lease-in-perpetuity tenure, to Samuel Hawksworth Midgley, who, finding the land unsuitable for his purposes, immediately requested the permission of the Auckland Land Board to transfer his interest therein to William Robert Clark, who had also applied for the said section, and executed a stamped agreement to that effect; and the said Board duly approved of the said transfer: And whereas the lease of the land has not yet been signed by the said Samuel Hawksworth Midgley, whose whereabouts cannot be ascertained though inquiries have been made and he has been advertised for, and it is desirable to authorise the issue of a title to the land in favour of the said William Robert Clark, who has been in occupation of the said land and effected considerable improvements thereon: Be it therefore enacted as follows:---
    
    The Auckland Land Board are hereby empowered to issue a lease in perpetuity for the said land direct to William Robert Clark upon the same terms and conditions as were expressed or implied in the lease proposed to be issued to the said Samuel Hawksworth Midgley.

##### 17 Paritutu closed roads
    
*   Whereas the Superintendent of the late Province of Taranaki, by notice in the Provincial Gazette of Taranaki dated the eleventh day of March, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-one, in pursuance of clause two of The Road Diversion Ordinance (Taranaki) 1870, notified the road-lines mentioned in Schedule [5][81] hereto to be closed road-lines, but the said road-lines were omitted to be proclaimed closed road-lines as prescribed by clause three of the said Ordinance: And whereas the Taranaki Land Board has from time to time sold for cash or disposed of by way of exchange the said road-lines under the authority of the Land Acts: And whereas the said road-lines not being legally closed it is not now possible to issue titles therefor, and it is desirable that the sales and exchanges of the said road-lines be validated, and that relief be granted as hereinafter mentioned: Be it therefore enacted as follows:---
        
    *   (a) The lands described in Schedule [5][81] hereto are hereby declared to be closed road-lines under the provisions of the [Public Works Act 1981][106]; and the sales or exchanges of the same are hereby ratified and confirmed.
    
    *   (b) The District Land Registrar is hereby empowered and directed to issue certificates of title to the persons mentioned in Schedule [5][81] hereto, for the areas set opposite their names, on the receipt from the Commissioner of Crown Lands for the Taranaki Land District of a certificate that the purchase-moneys have been paid and all the conditions of sale or exchange of the said lands have been fully complied with.
    
    The reference to the Public Works Compilation Act 1905 (1905 No 53), Appendix B of the repealing Act replaced the 1894 Act with a compiled Act enacted under the title of The Public Works Act 1905, was in turn consolidated, as from 4 August 1908, by section 1(2) Public Works Act 1908 (1908 No 160). That Act was in turn repealed, as from 6 October 1928, by section 346 Public Works Act 1928 (1928 No 21). That Act was in turn repealed, as from 1 February 1982, by section [248(1)][107] Public Works Act 1981 (1981 No 35).

##### 18 Reserve cancelled, Hangaroa Survey District
    
*   Whereas Section No 50, Block XIV, Hangaroa Survey District, in the Hawke's Bay Land District, containing twenty acres, was by notice in the _Gazette_ of the twenty-fifth day of October, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-eight, permanently reserved for travelling stock, but is not required for that purpose: And whereas the said land is overgrown with ragwort and noxious weeds, and the Hawke's Bay Land Board has recommended its sale to enable the section to be cleared of weeds and utilised: Be it therefore enacted as follows:---
    
    The reservation of Section No 50, Block XIV, Hangaroa Survey District, is hereby cancelled, and the said section is hereby declared to be Crown land and may be dealt with under the [Land Act 1948][108].
    
    The Land Act 1892 (1892 No 37) was consolidated, as from 4 August 1908, by section 1(2) Land Act 1908 (1908 No 94). That Act was in turn repealed, as from 1 January 1925, by section 390 Land Act 1924 (1924 No 31).

    The said notice of forfeiture of Tieme Mete's license is hereby cancelled, and the District Land Registrar for Hawke's Bay is hereby empowered to delete such notice of forfeiture from the Register, to enable the said license to be held by the said Tieme Mete under the same terms and conditions as previously.

##### 20 Site for dairy factory, Weber Survey District
