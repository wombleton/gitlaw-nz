## Schedule 5

Section [61][61].

THIS deed is made the 28th day of March, 1917, between the Mayor, Councillors, and Citizens of the City of Wellington (hereinafter termed the Corporation) of the first part, the Wellington Harbour Board (hereinafter termed the Board) of the second part, the Wellington Patent Slip Company (Limited), (hereinafter termed the Slip Company), of the third part, and Union Steamship Company of New Zealand (Limited), (hereinafter termed the new Union Company), of the fourth part.
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    Whereas, pursuant to the provisions of several Acts of the General Assembly of New Zealand and of the Provincial Council of the Province of Wellington, and by virtue of Crown grant, Volume 20, folio 127, and certificate of title, Volume 21, folio 287, the Slip Company is seised and possessed of certain lands in the Evans Bay district and in the bed of Wellington Harbour: And whereas the Slip Company has erected a patent slip upon part of the said land, and works appurtenant thereto, and plant in connection therewith, and has for many years carried on on the said land repairing and other work incidental to the patent slip: And whereas the new Union Company is the holder of a large number of shares in the Slip Company: And whereas by virtue of a deed dated the 23rd day of July, 1878, made between the Slip Company of the first part and Her late Majesty Queen Victoria of the other part, registered in the Deeds Registry Office as No 38914, and of the provisions of the said certificate of title, Volume 21, folio 287, it is provided that the Slip Company may resume the strip of land over which right of way was thereby granted (hereinafter called the said roadway) upon constructing a practicable road not less in width than the said original roadway, with a gradient not exceeding 1 in 15, along the line of hills at the back of the present engine-house; and by the said deed it is further provided that if at any time by the erection of the existing patent slip the rights of road granted by the said deed dated the 23rd day of July, 1878, are so materially obstructed or impeded as to make it necessary that another road in lieu thereof should be substituted, and Her Majesty, her heirs, successors, or assigns, and the Governor, shall, by notice in writing left at the office of the company, its successors or assigns, or at the last known place of residence of such assigns or any of them, or served personally upon them or any of them, require the company, its successors or assigns, to make and construct another practicable road, then the company, its successors or assigns, will with all reasonable diligence after such notice, at its and their own expense, make and construct such practicable road as before mentioned: Provided always that before such notice shall be given a certificate under the hand of the Chief Engineer of the Borough of the City of Wellington and a Justice of the Peace shall first be obtained that they have made due inquiry and that they consider that such obstruction as aforesaid is occasioned and that another practicable road should be made and completed, and such certificate shall be conclusive authority for the giving of such notice as aforesaid: And whereas the said roadway is now within the City of Wellington, but is subject to the rights of resumption by the Slip Company created by the said deed dated the 23rd day of July, 1878, and the Corporation has requested His Excellency the Governor to set up a Commission under the [Commissions of Inquiry Act 1908][157], to inquire whether, for the reasons set forth in the said deed dated the 23rd day of July, 1878, it is necessary that another road in lieu of the said roadway should be constructed: And whereas His Excellency has been pleased to appoint William Glendinning Riddell, Esquire, of the City of Wellington, Stipendiary Magistrate, and William James Roche, Esquire, of Lower Hutt Borough, Borough Engineer, to be a Commission to inquire whether it is necessary to construct such new road: And whereas by an agreement dated the 21st day of July, 1908, made between the Slip Company of the one part and the Board of the other part (which deed was ratified by the [Wellington Harbour Board Empowering Act 1908][155]), it was agreed, _inter alia_, that the company might at any time, and should if required by the Board after the 30th day of September, 1912, erect a second and smaller slip upon the said lands for the special convenience of the smaller vessels, and that such second slip should be erected and constructed in such manner as should be agreed between the Board and the Slip Company: And whereas the Union Steamship Company of New Zealand (Limited), (hereinafter termed the old Union Company), was entitled to claim the benefit of the rights conferred upon the Slip Company under the said deed dated the 21st day of July, 1908, and was bound by and was compelled in all respects to observe and perform the covenants, obligations, and duties by the said deed undertaken by the Slip Company, and that the same might be enforced against the old Union Company as well as against the Slip Company: And whereas in the year 1913 the old Union Company went into liquidation and was reconstructed as the new Union Company: And whereas the parties hereto have agreed that it is probable that at some future date, owing to necessary works that may be carried out in the neighbourhood, it may be possible to construct a new road behind the existing slip on the level of the present road, and that in such case it would not be expedient to construct a road on the hill behind the present slip: And whereas it is deemed advisable, in order to remove possible doubts as to the rights of the parties, to obtain legislation for the purposes hereinafter mentioned: Now, this deed witnesseth, and it is hereby agreed and declared by and between the parties hereto, as follows:---

##### 1
    
*   The Slip Company shall have the right to construct the said second and smaller slip, but the cradle shall be constructed clear of the new roadway to be laid out as hereinafter provided.

*   The Slip Company shall construct the new slipway so that where it crosses the said new roadway it shall be nearly as possible on a level therewith.

    (2.)

    (3.) The said new roadway shall be graded as far as possible in conformity with the level of the existing slipway and so as not in any way to diminish the present facilities of the Slip Company in connection with the use of the existing slip and the general operations of the company.

##### 5
    
*   The Slip Company shall provide adequate protection for the sewers, water-mains, and air-mains of the Corporation over which the new slip is to be constructed.

##### 6
    
*   (1.) For the existing roadway there shall be substituted a new roadway 100 links wide immediately seaward of the inner red line shown approximately on the sketch hereto annexed.
    
    (2.) So much of the existing roadway as lies to the landward of such inner red line shall vest in the Slip Company free from all rights of the public under the said deed of the 23rd day of July, 1878\.
    
    (3.) The portion of the said new roadway to be formed shall be the part thereof 50 links in width between the red lines approximately indicated on the said sketch.

##### 7
    
*   If the Corporation shall hereafter form the remaining portion of the said new roadway it shall so form and construct the same as not in any way to diminish the present facilities of the Slip Company in connection with the use of either of the said slips or the general operations of the company.

##### 8
    
*   Notwithstanding the revesting in the Slip Company of any part of the now existing roadway, or of the whole or any part of the new roadway, the rights of the Corporation in respect of the said sewers, water-mains, and air-mains shall remain unimpaired.

##### 9

    (1.) To obtain authority to construct the slipway of the second slip over the said new roadway.
    
    (2.) To provide that the Corporation shall be liable only for its own acts of negligence and those of its officers, servants, and agents in connection with the said new roadway and the slipway constructed or to be constructed thereon.
    
    (3.) To provide that the new Union Company shall have the same rights and obligations under the said deed dated the 21st day of July, 1908, the [Wellington Harbour Board Empowering Act 1908][155], and this deed as the Slip Company has.
    
    (4.) To provide that the rights of the company to construct or of His Majesty and the Governor to require the construction of a new road in lieu of the now existing roadway under the provisions of the said deed dated the 23rd day of July, 1878, shall be deemed to be reserved and to continue in existence, and that the said deed shall be read and construed as if the roadway therein referred to were the said new roadway: Provided that before requiring the new road to be constructed the Governor shall appoint a Commission under the [Commissions of Inquiry Act 1908][157], to inquire whether such new road is necessary.
    
    (5.) To provide that if another road shall be constructed in lieu of the said new roadway the said new roadway shall be closed and vested in the company free from all rights of the public.
    
    (6.) To give effect to the provisions of paragraphs [6][191], [7][192], and [8][193] of this agreement and the provisions of this agreement generally.
