    (4) The Commissioner, or any person authorised by him in writing in that behalf, or any person to whom a licence has been granted under the last preceding subsection may enter upon any land comprised in a pastoral licence issued under any of the said regulations for the purpose of cutting, felling, or removing all or any of the milling timber or silver pine growing, standing, or lying thereon, the Commissioner or other person doing as little damage as is reasonably possible:
    
    provided that where it is found necessary to remove or cut any fences for the purpose of working the timber, the fences shall be restored as near as may be to their original condition by the Commissioner or other person as soon as possible, and substantial gates or cattle stops shall be erected and maintained in place thereof by the Commissioner or other person during the removal of the timber for the purpose of preventing the straying of stock.
    
    (5) The right to enter upon the land comprised in any pastoral licence granted pursuant to any of the said regulations, for the purpose of cutting, felling, and removing the timber, shall include the right to construct such tramways and roadways, and to do such other works as may be necessary for the proper cutting, felling, or removal of the timber in accordance with the accepted practices for the milling of timber.
    
    (6) The licensee under any pastoral licence who suffers any damage done to buildings, crops, pastures, or fences or other substantial improvements by the Commissioner or by the person holding any licence granted under subsection (3), or who suffers damage by reason of the neglect of the Commissioner or other person to comply with the requirements of the proviso to subsection (4) shall be entitled to receive reasonable compensation therefor from the Commissioner or other person, as the case may be, but save as aforesaid the licensee shall not be entitled to receive any compensation in respect of the exercise by the Commissioner or any other person of the rights referred to in subsections (3), (4), and (5).
    
    (7) If any question arises as to the amount of any compensation payable under this section and the parties are unable to agree thereon, the question shall be referred to 1 arbitrator, if the parties can agree upon one, and otherwise to 2 arbitrators, one to be appointed by each party, under the provisions of the Arbitration Act 1908, and the obtaining of an award shall be a condition precedent to the commencement of legal proceedings in any court for the recovery of the amount claimed.
    
    (8) The provisions of section 357 of the Land Act 1924 shall not apply to the revenue received by the Receiver of Land Revenue in respect of royalty under any licence for cutting timber granted under the authority of this section, but one-fifth of that revenue shall be payable to the local authority within whose district the timber is obtained and the revenue derived, and shall be applied by such local authority exclusively in constructing, repairing, and maintaining roads.

##### 25 Extending for 5 years the term of certain leases and licences administered by Land Boards
    
*   Whereas numerous leases of land administered by Land Boards contain provision for the renewal thereof, or for the grant of new leases in substitution therefor, at rentals to be agreed upon or assessed in the manner prescribed:
    
    And whereas owing to the uncertain conditions at present prevailing it is difficult to find a fair and reasonable basis upon which to assess the rentals:
    
    And whereas negotiations for the renewal of leases or for the granting of new leases frequently commence 3 years before the expiry of existing leases:
    
    And whereas it is desirable to extend existing leases which are about to expire for a period sufficient to allow conditions to become stable:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    (1) For the purposes of this section the term _lease_ includes a licence, and the term _lessee_ includes a licensee.
    
    (2) Except as hereinafter provided, this section shall apply to every lease of land administered by a Land Board if the lessee has a right, whether absolute or not, to have on or before the expiration of the lease a renewal thereof or a new lease of the same land or any part of the same land upon the same or any other terms and conditions.
    
    (3) The term of each lease to which this section applies and which, but for the passing of this section, would expire by effluxion of time after the passing of this Act and on or before 1 January 1947 is hereby extended for a period of 9 years from the date of the expiry thereof subject to the same covenants, conditions, and restrictions as are contained and implied in the lease, and the estate of the lessee thereunder shall continue to be subject to all encumbrances, liens, and interests to which it is subject on the date of the expiry of the lease.
    
    (4) In any case where the provisions of any lease, the term whereof is extended by the last preceding subsection, require any proceedings relating to the renewal of the lease or the granting of a new lease in substitution therefor to be taken before a specified date, those provisions shall be read and interpreted as if a date 9 years later than the specified date were substituted therefor.
    
    (5) Where in the case of any lease the term whereof is extended by subsection (3) the lessee has, before the date of the passing of this Act, agreed to accept a renewal of the lease or a new lease in substitution therefor, the lessee shall have the option, to be exercised within 3 months after that date, of either accepting an extension of the existing lease as provided in this section or accepting the renewal or new lease as already agreed upon as if this section had not been passed.
    
    (6) In any case where a lease of land administered by a Land Board has expired between 1 June 1941 and the passing of this Act, and the lessee has a right to have a renewal of the lease or a new lease in substitution therefor but the terms of the renewal or new lease have not been agreed upon before the passing of this Act, the term of the expired lease shall be extended, and be deemed to have been extended, for a period of 5 years from the date of the expiry thereof subject to the same covenants, conditions, and restrictions as were contained and implied in the lease, and the estate of the lessee thereunder shall continue, and be deemed to have continued, to be subject to all encumbrances, liens, and interests to which it was subject on the date of the expiry of the lease.
    
    (7) Where on the expiration of any lease, the term whereof is extended by subsection (3) or subsection (6), a renewal of the lease or a new lease of the same land is granted to the lessee at a rental less than the rental payable under the expired lease, the amount by which the rent paid under the expired lease for the period of the extension exceeds rent for the same period at the rate payable under the renewal or new lease, as the case may be, shall be credited towards the rent accruing due under the renewal or new lease.
    
    (8) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section, any lessee under a lease the term whereof is extended by this section may, with the consent of the Minister given on the recommendation of the Land Board and upon and subject to such terms and conditions as may be imposed, surrender the lease.
    
    (9) On receipt of a certificate signed by the Commissioner of Crown Lands setting forth particulars of the extension of the term of any lease under this section, the District Land Registrar shall, without fee, endorse a memorial thereof on the registered instrument of lease.
    
    (10) Nothing in this section shall apply in respect of any lease if the lessee thereunder has, before the passing of this Act, given notice pursuant to section 200 of the Land Act 1924 that he does not require a renewed lease, unless the lessee notifies the Land Board in writing not later than 3 months after the passing of this Act or 3 months before the expiry of his lease (whichever is the later) that he desires this section to apply to the lease.

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][55] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][57] and [17E][58] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.

    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
