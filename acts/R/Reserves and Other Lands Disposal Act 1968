    And whereas the council is, by paragraph (e) of the said subsection (5), empowered in specific cases, with the approval of the Minister of Lands, to enter into leases of any unleased part of the endowment land without a right of renewal:

    (3) This section shall confer on every lessee whose lease is subsisting at the passing of this Act, and on every lessee who is hereafter granted a lease, while his lease remains current, a right to acquire the freehold of the land comprised in the lease on the terms prescribed by this section.
    
    (4) Where under this section a lessee gives notice of his desire to acquire the freehold of the land comprised in his lease, the rights and obligations of the lessee arising from the notice shall enure for the benefit of and be enforceable against him, his executors, administrators, and assigns to the like extent (but no further) as rights and obligations arising under a contract for a sale freely entered into between a lessor and a lessee; and, accordingly, in relation to matters arising out of any such notice, references in this section to the lessee shall, so far as the context permits, include his respective executors, administrators, and assigns.
    
    (5) Notwithstanding anything in subsection (4), the rights and obligations conferred on any lessee by that subsection shall be assignable with, but not capable of subsisting apart from, the lease of the land comprised in the lease; and if the lease of one part of that land is assigned without the benefit of the notice, or if the lease of one part of the land is assigned to or vests in any person without the lease of another part, the notice shall accordingly cease to have effect. In the event of any default by the council or the lessee in carrying out the obligations arising from any such notice, the other of them shall have the like rights and remedies as in the case of a contract freely entered into.
    
    (6) Where a lessee gives to the council written notice of his desire to purchase the freehold of the land comprised in his lease, then the council, in the name and on behalf of the corporation, shall be bound to make to the lessee, and the lessee to accept (at the price and on the terms prescribed by this section), a transfer of the land for an estate in fee simple absolute.
    
    (7) A lessee's notice under subsection (6) shall specify the name and address of the lessee and shall contain sufficient particulars to identify the property to which the right of acquisition extends.

    *   (b) secondly, the value as determined by the council of the fixtures and other improvements (if any) erected or carried out by the council, or any previous owner of the freehold, and not purchased by the lessee or by any lessee under a previous lease.
    
    (9) Where a lessee notifies the council that he desires to acquire the freehold of the land comprised in his lease, the council shall immediately assess the price to be paid in respect of the land in accordance with subsection (8), and shall then notify the lessee in writing of the price, including its constituent amounts.
    
    (10) Within 14 days of being notified of the council's assessment in accordance with subsection (9), the lessee may file an objection in the office of the Land Valuation Court nearest to the place where the land or any part of the land to which the objection relates is situated. On any such objection being filed, all the provisions of the [Land Valuation Court Act 1948][34], and all the rules for the time being in force under that Act, so far as they are applicable, shall apply in respect of the objection as if it were an objection to which [section 21][35] of that Act relates. If no such objection is filed within the said period, the assessment of the council shall be deemed to have been assented to by the lessee.
    
    (11) Not later than 2 months from the date of notification of the determination of the purchase price or from the date on which any objection to the determination is finally disposed of or is withdrawn, whichever is the later, the lessee shall pay to the council the purchase price, whereupon the council shall cause to be prepared and executed by the corporation a transfer of the land comprised in the lease to the lessee.
    
    (12) At any time before the execution of the transfer the lessee may give written notice to the council that he is unable or unwilling to acquire the freehold of the land comprised in his lease, and thereupon the notice given under subsection (6) shall cease to have effect; and he shall be liable to make such compensation as may be just to the council in respect of any work performed by it in assessing the purchase price and preparing the transfer or conveyance (if any).
    
    (13) Any transfer by the corporation transferring to any lessee the freehold of the land comprised in his lease shall provide for---
        
    *   (a) unless the lessee agrees to the contrary, the land to have the benefit of such easements and other incorporeal hereditaments, and of such restrictive covenants, over other parts of land vested in the corporation, so far as the corporation is capable of granting or creating them, as are necessary to secure to the lessee as nearly as practicable the same rights as, immediately before the execution of the transfer, were available to him under his lease; and
    
    *   (b) unless the council or other person agrees to the contrary, the land to be subject to such easements and other incorporeal hereditaments, and to such restrictive covenants, for the benefit of other land as are necessary to secure to the corporation or other person interested in the other land as nearly as practicable the same rights as, immediately before the execution of the transfer, were available against the lessee under the lease.
    
    (14) The council shall from time to time spend the net proceeds from the sale or lease of any of the endowment land on the provision of services and public amenities for the benefit of the inhabitants of Foxton Beach Township, or on the improvement, maintenance, or repair of any such services and amenities, or on the improvement, maintenance, or repair of any existing services or public amenities. For the purposes of this subsection, the term _services_ includes roads, road lighting, water supply, drainage, sewerage, and other public works.

    (16) Where any lessee or other person acquires the freehold of any part of the endowment land under this section, he shall, in addition to meeting the costs and expenses normally incurred by a purchaser in acquiring land, bear the reasonable costs of or incidental to any valuation, survey, and other expenses incurred by the council in respect of the transaction.

*   This is a reprint of the Reserves and Other Lands Disposal Act 1968\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 29 June 1988, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][36] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][37] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][38] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][39] and [17E][40] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
