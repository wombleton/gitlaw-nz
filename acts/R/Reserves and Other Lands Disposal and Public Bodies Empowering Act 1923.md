    (1) The Manukau County Council is hereby authorized, and shall be deemed always to have been authorized, to acquire a site and erect thereon a public hall and to acquire and lay out a recreation-ground within the special-rating area hereinbefore referred to, and to raise for carrying out such purposes a special loan as if for a public work.

Nothing in these presents shall entitle the Borough Council to any rights over or in the Kauaeranga River below the main water-race intakes which will unduly interfere with the county's administration of that portion of the Thames County. 17\. Should the Borough Council be unable during the present or any future session of Parliament to obtain legislation to fully and effectually confirm or give effect to each and all or any of the terms, conditions, and stipulations expressed or implied in these presents, then such failure shall not prejudice or be deemed to prejudice these presents or the rights, powers, and privileges conferred hereby upon the Borough Council so far as the County Council is legally concerned. 18\.
