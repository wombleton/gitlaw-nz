    And whereas in consequence of those trustees ceasing to hold office, certain other persons were from time to time appointed to be the trustees of the cemetery under section 4 of the Cemeteries Act 1908, and the land was from time to time vested in accordance with section 11 of that Act in the persons who were for the time being those trustees:
    
    And whereas the last surviving trustee of the cemetery died in 1963 and no further trustees have since been appointed:
    
    And whereas no persons are willing to be appointed to be the trustees of the cemetery:
    
    And whereas the land was in February 1969 resurveyed and subdivided into the respective parcels of lands secondly, thirdly, and fourthly described in subsection (3) (the total area of those parcels being ascertained as the correct area of the land first described in that subsection):
    
    And whereas the lands secondly and thirdly described in subsection (3) had never been used and were not required for cemetery purposes:
    
    And whereas the Minister of Lands, by notice dated 17 June 1969 and published in the _Gazette_ of that year at page 1130, pursuant to the Reserves and Domains Act 1953, revoked the reservation for cemetery purposes of the lands secondly and thirdly described in subsection (3):
    
    And whereas the Minister of Lands, by notice dated 17 June 1969 and published in the _Gazette_ of that year at page 1130, set apart as a reserve for scenic purposes pursuant to the [Land Act 1948][14] the land secondly described in subsection (3), and pursuant to the Reserves and Domains Act 1953 declared that reserve to form part of the Tautuku Bay Scenic Reserve, to be administered as a scenic reserve by the Southeast Otago Scenic Board appointed under the Reserves and Domains Act 1953 (in this section referred to as the **Board**):
    
    And whereas there have been no burials for many years in the land fourthly described in subsection (3), being the land now comprising the Chaslands Cemetery:

    (1) The cemetery on the land fourthly described in subsection (3) shall, as from the passing of this Act, be deemed to be closed in accordance with the [Burial and Cremation Act 1964][16] and, notwithstanding [sections 41][17] and [42][18] of that Act, no further burials shall take place in that cemetery.
    
    (2) Notwithstanding [section 43][15] of the Burial and Cremation Act 1964 or any other enactment or rule of law, the land fourthly described in subsection (3) is hereby declared to be set apart as a reserve for scenic purposes, and to be part of the Tautuku Bay Scenic Reserve to be administered by the Board subject to the Reserves and Domains Act 1953 but otherwise freed and discharged from all trusts, reservations, and restrictions affecting that land.

    And whereas it is desirable that those parts of the land described in subsection (2) should have been set apart as and for State forests on the date on which they were purportedly set apart:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    (1) The said reservation for the purpose of a railway of the land described in subsection (2) shall be deemed to have been revoked on 12 August 1898\.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Reserves and Other Lands Disposal Act 1971\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 18 December 1992, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][34] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][35] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][36] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][37] and [17E][38] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
