    Provided that a judgment shall not be registered if at the date of the application---
        
    *   (a) It has been wholly satisfied; or
    
    *   (b) It could not be enforced . . . in the country of the original Court.

    *   (c) The sum for which a judgment is registered shall carry interest; and
    
    *   (d) The High Court shall have the same control over the enforcement of a registered judgment---
    
    as if the judgment had been a judgment originally given in the High Court on the date of registration:
    
    Provided that the judgment shall not be enforced so long as, under this Part of this Act and the rules of Court made thereunder, it is competent for any party to make an application to have the registration of the judgment set aside, or, where such an application is made, until after the application has been finally determined.
    
    (2A) A judgment may only be enforced if, and to the extent that, at the time the proceedings for enforcement are or are to be taken, the judgment is capable of being enforced in the country of the original Court.

    (6) In addition to any sum of money payable under the judgment of the original Court, including any interest which by the law of the country of the original Court becomes due under the judgment up to the time of registration, the judgment shall be registered for the reasonable costs of and incidental to registration, including the costs of obtaining a certified copy of the judgment from the original Court.

##### 7 Powers of High Court on application to set aside registration
    
*   (1) If, on an application to set aside the registration of a judgment, the applicant satisfies the High Court either that an appeal is pending, or that he is entitled and intends to appeal, against the judgment, the Court, if it thinks fit, may, on such terms as it may think just, either set aside the registration or adjourn the application to set aside the registration until after the expiration of such period as appears to the High Court to be reasonably sufficient to enable the applicant to take the necessary steps to have the appeal disposed of by a competent tribunal.
    
    (2) Where the registration of a judgment is set aside under the last preceding subsection, or solely for the reason that the judgment was not at the date of the application for registration enforceable . . . in the country of the original Court, the setting aside of the registration shall not prejudice a further application to register the judgment when the appeal has been disposed of or if and when the judgment becomes enforceable . . . in that country, as the case may be.
    
    (3) Where the registration of a judgment is set aside solely for the reason that the judgment, notwithstanding that it had at the date of the application for registration been partly satisfied, was registered for the whole sum payable thereunder, the High Court shall, on the application of the judgment creditor, order judgment to be registered for the balance remaining payable at that date.
