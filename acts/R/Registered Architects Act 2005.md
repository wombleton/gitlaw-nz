        *   (iii) any disciplinary penalty imposed on the person in the last 3 years; and

    *   (c) determine the complaint in accordance with the rules after considering the report of that investigator or of those investigators (as the case may be).
    
    (3) If the Board determines not to proceed with a complaint because the matter relates to a building practitioner who is licensed under the [Building Act 2004][109], the Board must refer the complaint to the Registrar of Licensed Building Practitioners appointed under that Act.
    
    (4) A complaint or inquiry, and any decision on the complaint or inquiry, may relate to a person who is no longer a registered architect but who was a registered architect at the time of the relevant conduct.

        *   (i) a registered architect has been convicted, whether before or after he or she is registered, by any court in New Zealand or elsewhere of any offence punishable by imprisonment for a term of 6 months or more; and

    *   (b) a registered architect has breached the code of ethics contained in the rules; or
    
    *   (c) a registered architect has practised as a registered architect in a negligent or incompetent manner; or

        *   (i) either orally or in writing, made any declaration or representation knowing it to be false or misleading in a material particular; or
        
        *   (ii) produced to the Board or made use of any document knowing it to contain a declaration or representation referred to in subparagraph (i); or
        
        *   (iii) produced to the Board or made use of any document knowing that it was not genuine.

    *   (b) suspend the person's registration for a period of no more than 12 months or until the person meets specified conditions relating to the registration (but, in any case, not for a period of more than 12 months) and record the suspension in the register:
    
    *   (c) order that the person be censured:
