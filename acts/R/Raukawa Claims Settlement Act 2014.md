    (3) The acknowledgements and apology are to be read together with the historical account recorded in Part 2 of the deed of settlement.

##### 8 Summary of historical account
    
*   (1) The Crown acknowledgements and apologies are based on the historical account. Raukawa have practised mana whakahaere, kaitiakitanga, and ahikaroa within their rohe and have a special relationship to the land and the waterways in this area. Waterways in particular have been the centre of Raukawa commercial, social, cultural, and spiritual life. 
    
    (2) The Crown's actions and omissions impacted upon Raukawa's commercial, social, cultural, and spiritual relationships with the land and waterways in their rohe.
    
    ###### War and confiscation
    
    (3) The wars of the 1860s caused Raukawa great prejudice. The Crown acted unjustly in sending Crown forces into the Waikato in July 1863 and occupying land in the region during 1863 and 1864\. While some Raukawa appear to have participated in the conflict in 1863, it was not until 1864 when Crown forces reached the Raukawa rohe near Cambridge, Rangiaowhia, and Paterangi, that significant numbers of Raukawa fought as a tribe. 
    
    (4) The final battle of the Waikato war took place between 31 March and 2 April 1864, at ≈årƒÅkau, near Rangiaowhia. Approximately 250 to 300 MƒÅori, a significant proportion of whom were Raukawa, defended ≈årƒÅkau pƒÅ against up to 1 800 Crown troops for 3 days until the defenders broke out of the pƒÅ on 2 April. Some, such as the Raukawa chief Te Paerata, were killed, while others successfully escaped. 
    
    (5) After the battle at ≈årƒÅkau, Raukawa participated in fighting in Tauranga, particularly at the battles of Gate PƒÅ and Te Ranga. While many Tauranga hap≈´ and iwi made peace with the Crown following the end of open conflict in 1864, 3 years later some Raukawa joined hap≈´ from Tauranga in what are known as the "Bush Campaigns". 
    
    (6) The Crown confiscated land at Tauranga and the Waikato that Raukawa had interests in as punishment for what the Crown regarded as rebellion. The Crown returned some land to individual members of Raukawa hap≈´ residing in Tauranga and none to Raukawa hap≈´ in the Waikato. The loss of life and property because of war and raupatu had a severe impact on the well-being of Raukawa.
    
    ###### _Impact of MƒÅori land legislation on Raukawa_
    
    (7) Before the Crown completed the confiscation, it reformed MƒÅori land legislation leading to the introduction of the Native Land Court within the Raukawa rohe in 1866 at a time of uncertainty and economic and social disruption. Raukawa, as part of the Kƒ´ngitanga, sought to retain control and ownership of MƒÅori land within the wider Te Rohe P≈çtae; but the Crown encouraged Raukawa to detach itself from the authority of the MƒÅori King. 
    
    (8) The native land law made Raukawa land more susceptible to alienation. Raukawa consider that the court did not recognize all of their land interests. Raukawa did not fully participate in the 1868 Native Land Court hearings for Maungatautari as the Crown had not negotiated peace with Raukawa and other Kƒ´ngitanga iwi following the armed conflict of the 1860s. Raukawa unsuccessfully used legal processes to challenge the exclusion of their tupuna, Raukawa, from the t≈´puna of the Taup≈ç-nui-a-Tia Block.
    
    ###### _The impact of private land speculation on Raukawa_
    
    (9) Systematic large-scale land speculation by private parties resulted in rapid and substantial land loss for Raukawa in the late nineteenth century. Private parties and the Crown purchased nearly 800 000 acres (80 percent) of land within the Waikato basin before 1900\. In the twentieth century, the iwi lost further land through public works takings, including for hydro-electric projects. Raukawa have a long-standing grievance relating to the Crown's 1915 gift of 20 000 acres of land in the Pouakani Block to an iwi with no ancestral ties to the area, which exacerbated the grievance that Raukawa continue to feel today about the earlier loss of their interests in the Pouakani lands.
    
    (10) The Crown failed to protect Raukawa from becoming virtually landless. This restricted their ability to participate in new economic opportunities and contributed to the economic, social, and cultural impoverishment of Raukawa.

##### 9 Acknowledgements
    
*   (1) The Crown has previously acknowledged that its representatives and advisers acted unjustly and in breach of the Treaty of Waitangi in its dealings with the Kƒ´ngitanga, which included Raukawa, in sending its forces across the Mangatawhiri in July 1863, and occupying and subsequently confiscating land in the Waikato region, and these actions resulted in Raukawa being unfairly labelled as rebels.
    
    (2) The Crown hereby recognises those grievances and acknowledges that it has failed for many years to deal with the remaining long-standing grievances of Raukawa in an appropriate way and that recognition of those grievances is long overdue. Accordingly, it now makes the following further acknowledgements.
    
    (3) The Crown acknowledges---
        
    *   (a) that, after it sent armed forces into the Waikato in 1863, Raukawa were drawn into the fighting through their whakapapa connections and links to the Kƒ´ngitanga and, especially, after Crown troops attacked the unfortified village of Rangiaowhia on 20 February 1864; and
    
    *   (b) that Raukawa suffered a prolonged period of disruption during the armed conflict of the 1860s, suffering loss of life and destruction of property during the first Taranaki war of 1860 and 1861, the Waikato war of 1863--1864, and the conflicts in Tauranga in 1864 and 1867; and
    
    *   (c) that the final battle in the Waikato war took place in the Raukawa rohe when Crown troops attacked the pƒÅ fortified by Raukawa and other iwi at ≈årƒÅkau between 31 March and 2 April 1864 killing over 80 MƒÅori during the battle and when fleeing the pƒÅ; and
    
    *   (d) that, during the wars of the 1860s, Raukawa lost prominent leaders, which had a severe impact on the social structure and rangatiratanga of Raukawa, and on the strength of Raukawa as a people; and
    
    *   (e) the sense of grievance suffered by Raukawa and the distress to generations of Raukawa who felt they were unfairly considered to be rebels during the 1860s.
    
    (4) The Crown also acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) Raukawa hap≈´ suffered loss of life when the Crown attacked Pukehinahina and Te Ranga in 1864; and
    
    *   (b) it was ultimately responsible for extending the conflict in the Waikato to Tauranga, for the battles at Pukehinahina and Te Ranga in 1864, and the resulting loss of life, and its actions were in breach of the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles; and
    
    *   (c) when Crown forces attacked MƒÅori during the "Bush Campaigns" inland of Tauranga in 1867, they destroyed kainga and cultivations, thereby forcing Raukawa living in the area to flee their homes, and this conduct was unreasonable and breached the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles.
    
    (5) In addition to the compulsory extinguishment of Raukawa interests in Waikato land confiscated in 1865, the Crown also acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) the compensation court did not sit in the southern most part of the Waikato raupatu block, and later reserves granted in this area were not awarded to Raukawa hap≈´. As a result, Raukawa were not awarded any land in this area and became alienated from those lands and resources; and
    
    *   (b) its confiscation of land in the Tauranga confiscation district compulsorily extinguished customary interests in that land, including those of Raukawa, and this was unjust and breached the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles; and
    
    *   (c) the prejudicial effect of the confiscation was compounded by the delay in returning land in the Tauranga area to Raukawa hap≈´ with claims to the land.
    
    (6) The Crown acknowledges that its armed conflict with a leader from another iwi, which spread into the Raukawa rohe during 1869 and 1872, created tensions between and caused disruption for Raukawa hap≈´.
    
    (7) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) it did not consult Raukawa prior to the introduction of the native land laws; and
    
    *   (b) the operation and impact of the native land laws, in particular the award of land to individual Raukawa and the enabling of individuals to deal with that land without reference to iwi or hap≈´, made those lands more susceptible to partition, fragmentation, and alienation. This undermined the traditional tribal structures, mana, and rangatiratanga of Raukawa, which were based on collective tribal and hap≈´ custodianship of the land. The Crown failed to protect those collective tribal structures, which had a prejudicial effect on Raukawa and was a breach of the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles.
    
    (8) The Crown also acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) Raukawa did not fully participate in the 1868 Native Land Court hearings for Maungatautari as they were held at a time when the Crown had not negotiated peace with Raukawa and other Kƒ´ngitanga iwi following the armed conflict of 1863--1864 in the Waikato and 1864 and 1867 in Tauranga; and
    
    *   (b) Raukawa used legal processes to challenge the exclusion of their t≈´puna, Raukawa, from the t≈´puna of the Taup≈ç-nui-a-Tia block, but their appeals were unsuccessful; their sense of grievance remains to this day;
    
    *   (c) until 1883, native land laws did not penalise those who made payments for MƒÅori land before the Native Land Court had determined title to that land. Such payments could commit Raukawa landowners to Native Land Court title investigations that they did not want and to sell land to pay for surveys and associated court and legal costs, including living expenses to attend hearings; and
    
    *   (d) Raukawa has a long-standing grievance about the extent of land acquired by private interests who paid money in the late 1870s and early 1880s for MƒÅori land before title had been awarded for that land.
    
    (9) The Crown acknowledges---
        
    *   (a) that Raukawa, as part of the Kƒ´ngitanga, sought to retain control and ownership of MƒÅori land within Te Rohe P≈çtae by opposing the construction of roads, surveys, and the introduction of the Native Land Court up until the early 1880s; and
    
    *   (b) the sense of grievance held by Raukawa regarding the Crown's attempts in the 1870s to encourage Raukawa to detach itself from the authority of the MƒÅori King by funding the construction of roads and surveys and introducing the Native Land Court into the Raukawa rohe.
    
    (10) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) Crown and private purchases led to the alienation of more than three-quarters of the landholdings of Raukawa by 1910; and
    
    *   (b) the cumulative effect of the Crown's actions and omissions, particularly its failure to actively protect the interests of Raukawa in the land it wished to retain, left Raukawa virtually landless by the mid-twentieth century. The Crown's failure to ensure Raukawa had sufficient land for their present and future needs was a breach of the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles.
    
    (11) The Crown acknowledges that in 1915 it gifted 20,000 acres of land in the Pouakani block to an iwi with no ancestral ties to the area and that this gift exacerbated the grievance that Raukawa continue to feel today about the earlier loss of their interests in the Pouakani lands.
    
    (12) The Crown acknowledges that the loss of land had a negative impact on the ability of Raukawa to participate in new economic opportunities and challenges emerging within their rohe in the twentieth century.
    
    (13) The Crown acknowledges that it did not recognise the iwi status of Raukawa until the late twentieth century and this failure to respect the rangatiratanga of Raukawa created an ongoing grievance.

##### 10 Apology
    
*   (1) The Crown makes this apology to Raukawa, to their ancestors, and to their descendants.
    
    (2) The Crown profoundly regrets and unreservedly apologises to Raukawa for its actions and omissions that led to the virtual landlessness of Raukawa in the Waikato, and which caused suffering and hardship to generations of Raukawa.
    
    (3) The Crown deeply regrets its actions during the New Zealand wars of the 1860s, which resulted in the loss of life and was destructive and demoralising to Raukawa.
    
    (4) The Crown apologises for its past failures to acknowledge the mana and rangatiratanga of Raukawa and looks forward to building an enduring relationship of mutual trust and cooperation with Raukawa that is based on respect for the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles.

### Subpart 5---Maungatautari Mountain Scenic Reserve

##### 85 Statement of significance
    
*   (1) The following is the statement of the significance of Maungatautari to Raukawa:
    
    "Ki te Wairere
    
    Horohoro
    
    Pohaturoa
    
    Ko Ongaroto
    
    Ko WhƒÅita e
    
    Nukuhau
    
    Ki Taup≈ç-nui-a-tia
    
    Ki runga o Hurakia
    
    Hauhungaroa
    
    Titiraupenga
    
    Arowhena
    
    Wharep≈´hunga
    
    Titiraupenga
    
    Whakamarumaru
    
    Te Pae o Raukawa
    
    Titiro atu ki Te Kaokaoroa-o-PƒÅtetere
    
    Maungatautari
    
    Ka titiro ki Wharep≈´hunga
    
    Ko Hoturoa, ko PƒÅrƒÅwera
    
    Ko te Manawa rƒÅ o NgƒÅti Raukawa e.
    
    (2) Raukawa has a very long association to the mountain, Maungatautari. The mountain is located on the west bank of the Waikato River south of Cambridge. This mountain holds spiritual, cultural and historical significance to the iwi of Raukawa and others.
    
    (3) For Raukawa, the association to Maungatautari stems back to the arrival of the Tainui waka in Aotearoa and the Raukawa ancestors RakatƒÅura and Kahukeke. Raukawa is a descendant of RakatƒÅura and Kahukeke. Following the arrival of the waka into KƒÅwhia, RakatƒÅura and Kahukeke left that area and journeyed into the interior of the Central North Island. Along the way RakatƒÅura named many places. According to Raukawa tradition, RakatƒÅura spied a majestic mountain that appeared to be suspended above a thick blanket of mist. It was this event that prompted RakatƒÅura to name the place Maungatautari.
    
    (4) Ten generations later, following the birth of her new born son Raukawa, MƒÅhina-a-rangi crossed the Waikato River below Maungatautari. She named the place she crossed, Horahora, in recognition of having to lay out the wet clothing of her son to dry.
    
    (5) Two generations later, a pƒÅ named Te Tiki-o-Te-Ihingarangi, was built by a grandson of Raukawa at Karapiro, below Maungatautari. Later also, other grandsons of Raukawa namely WhƒÅita, Tamatehura, ≈™pokoiti, Wairangi, Ngakohua and Pipito led a war party through the Central North Island killing an indigenous iwi. PƒÅ at Maungatautari belonging to that iwi were taken and Tamatehura eventually settled there.
    
    (6) Also living at Maungatautari was Tukorehe and his elder brother, Kauwhata. Tukorehe was the eponymous ancestor of the Raukawa hap≈´ NgƒÅti Tukorehe.
    
    (7) Descendants of Raukawa continued to live at Maungatautari. These descendants included the famed Raukawa ancestors Ngatokowaru and later the war chiefs Wahineiti and his younger brother Hapekit≈´arangi.
    
    (8) In the early part of the nineteenth century some members of Raukawa migrated south from Maungatautari. However, other members of Raukawa remained at Maungatautari and the iwi has a continued presence in the area today.
    
    (9) In 1868 the title investigation into the Maungatautari land blocks began in the Native Land Courts.
    
    (10) Raukawa individuals from ≈åtaki were among those who applied to the court for ownership of these lands, but the court awarded title to other iwi. Raukawa living in the area did not present evidence about their interests in Maungatautari to the court because the title investigation began in a period of uncertainty for Raukawa in the aftermath of the armed conflict that took place in the Waikato in 1863 and 1864\. Raukawa contested the court's decision over several decades through parliamentary petitions, applications for re-hearings and subsequent court hearings.
    
    (11) Raukawa assert that they have continued to maintain an association to Maungatautari. Many Raukawa hap≈´ reside below Maungatautari and have settled the area for generations and had large gardens that grew wheat and other food.
    
    (12) When the hydro-generation projects commenced along the Waikato River in the wider Maungatautari area, members of Raukawa were amongst the workforce that built the dams at Karapiro, Horahora and Arapuni.
    
    (13) In the 1990s the monument ""Te Taurapa o Te Ihingarangi"" was erected near Maungatautari at Karapiro. Raukawa kaumƒÅtua played an important role in the unveiling of the monument and stood with Te Arikinui Te AtairangikƒÅhu as she unveiled it.
    
    (14) Today, Raukawa is an active member in the Maungatautari Ecological Island Trust."
