    And whereas 5 of those trustees have died and have since been replaced by an order of that court dated 12 August 1969:
    
    And whereas pursuant to section 438 of the Maori Affairs Act another order of the court (in this section referred to as the **trust order**) was made on that date ordering the land to be held in trust for the benefit of the descendants of Marutuahu, Hako, and Hei, and that the land be transferred to Her Majesty the Queen by way of gift on the conditions in the trust order specified in subsection (2):
    
    And whereas Her Majesty is willing to accept the land on the conditions set out in the trust order, and to administer the land as a reserve for flora and fauna:

    And whereas it is desirable that the land be vested in Her Majesty as a reserve as aforesaid subject to the conditions specified in the trust order:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of Part 21 of the Maori Affairs Act 1953 or of any other enactment, the land is hereby vested in Her Majesty the Queen for the purposes of a reserve for the preservation of flora and fauna on the land, subject to the Reserves and Domains Act 1953 and subject to the conditions of the trust order that are specified in subsection (2):
    
    provided that to the extent that any of those conditions are inconsistent with the said Reserves and Domains Act, the terms of the order shall prevail.
    
    (2) The conditions specified in the trust order are that Her Majesty undertakes---
        
    *   (a) to protect the land by declaring it to be and administering it as a reserve:

    And whereas, by notice dated 8 September 1904 and published in the _Gazette_ on the 15th day of that month at pages 2208 and 2209, the Governor granted the endowment land to the Kyeburn Public Library (Incorporated) (in this section referred to as the **incorporation**): 
    
    And whereas the income from the endowment exceeds the amount required for the purposes of the library maintained by the incorporation on other land:
    
    And whereas the incorporation desires to use the surplus income for other charitable purposes within the County of Maniototo, but has no power to do so:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    (1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in [section 44][17] of the Reserves, Endowments, and Crown and Maori Lands Exchange, Sale, Disposal, and Enabling Act 1898 or in any other enactment or rule of law, the incorporation may from time to time make grants to any person domiciled within the County of Maniototo for any purpose that is a charitable purpose within the meaning of [section 2][18] of the Charitable Trusts Act 1957 out of any income derived from the endowment land that is not required for the satisfactory maintenance of the library, or any library which may hereafter replace that library.
    
    (2) The land to which this section relates is particularly described as follows:

*   This is a reprint of the Reserves and Other Lands Disposal Act 1970\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 24 May 1989, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][19] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][20] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][21] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][22] and [17E][23] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
