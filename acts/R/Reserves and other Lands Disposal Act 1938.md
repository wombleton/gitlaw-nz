An Act to provide for the sale, reservation, and other disposition of certain reserves, Crown lands, endowments, and other lands, to validate certain transactions, and to make provision in respect of certain other matters

##### 1 Short Title
    
*   This Act may be cited as the Reserves and other Lands Disposal Act 1938\.

##### 2 Authorising the grant of additional land to the registered proprietors of Allotment 68, Parish of Waikomiti, North Auckland Land District, as compensation for a shortage in area
    
*   Whereas the original survey of Allotment 68, Parish of Waikomiti, North Auckland Land District, showed the area of that allotment to be 40 acres, and a Crown grant of the allotment based on the said survey was made on 12 October 1857:
    
    And whereas more recent surveys disclose the correct area of the allotment to be 25 acres 2 roods and 25 perches, and it is equitable that the registered proprietors of the allotment should be compensated in respect of the error so made:
    
    And whereas the said registered proprietors have agreed to accept 11 acres 1 rood and 29 perches of Crown land hereinafter described as full compensation, and it is expedient that authority should be given accordingly:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    (1) The land described in subsection (2) is hereby vested for an estate in fee simple in the registered proprietors of the said Allotment 68 in full compensation in respect of the survey error hereinbefore referred to, and the District Land Registrar at Auckland, upon application made to him in that behalf by the Chief Surveyor at Auckland, is hereby empowered and directed to issue, free of charge, to the said registered proprietors a certificate of title for the said land.
    
    (2) The Crown land to which this section relates is particularly described as follows:
    
    All those areas in the said Parish of Waikomiti, being firstly, portion of Allotment 69, containing 7 acres and 5 perches, and, secondly, Allotment 389, containing 4 acres 1 rood and 24 perches: as the same are shown respectively on plans numbered 23151 and 21731 deposited in the Office of the Chief Surveyor at Auckland.

##### 3 Defining the status of certain lands in Kopuru Parish, North Auckland Land District
    
*   Whereas by Proclamation published in the _Auckland Provincial Government Gazette_ of 8 June 1870, Lot 4 of Allotment 2, and Allotment 50, Parish of Kopuru, were reserved for the purposes of common-school education within the Province of Auckland, and by notice published in the _Gazette_ of 16 December 1878 the said reserves were apportioned for the purposes of secondary and primary education respectively:
    
    And whereas by Proclamation published in the _Gazette_ of 24 March 1898 certain lands which were in fact the said Lot 4 of Allotment 2, part of the said Allotment 50, part of a public road, and certain Crown land, being Lot 5 of Allotment 2, Parish of Kopuru, but which were described as Allotment 50 of the said parish, were purported to have been reserved as an endowment for primary education:
    
    And whereas, on 11 November 1908, certificate of title, Volume 154, folio 91, Auckland Registry, was issued to the School Commissioners of the Province of Auckland for portion of the area so purported to have been reserved:
    
    And whereas the land comprised in the said certificate of title was subdivided, and by Warrant published in the _Gazette_ of 20 March 1924 the reservation so purported to have been made was purported to have been cancelled over one of such subdivisions described as Lot 22 of Allotment 50, Parish of Kopuru, and Allotment 125, Parish of Kopuru, was purported to have been reserved as an endowment for primary education in lieu thereof:
    
    And whereas the said Lot 22 was subsequently purported to have been reserved for recreation purposes, and by Order in Council published in the _Gazette_ of 22 October 1925 was purported to have been added to the Kopuru Town Domain:
    
    And whereas there are at present 2 areas described as Allotment 2, Parish of Kopuru, and it is deemed advisable to renumber the said Lots 4 and 5, and to redescribe the said Lot 22:
    
    And whereas it is also desirable to revoke the Proclamation secondly above mentioned and to define the status of certain lands:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    (1) The said Proclamation published in the _Gazette_ of 24 March 1898 is hereby revoked.
    
    (2) The said Lots 4 and 5 and the said Lot 22 shall hereafter be known as Allotments 149, 150, and Lot 22, DP 17979, of Allotment 149, Parish of Kopuru, respectively.
    
    (3) The said Lot 22 is hereby declared to be a reserve for public recreation and to have formed part of the Kopuru Town Domain since 22  October 1925\.
    
    (4) The said Allotments 125 and 150 are hereby reserved as endowments for secondary education and shall be deemed to have been so reserved since 12 March 1924, and 18 March 1898, respectively.
    
    (5) The District Land Registrar at Auckland is hereby empowered and directed to cancel certificates of title, Volume 154, folio 91, and Volume 629, folio 263, Auckland Registry, and to issue separate certificates of title for Allotments 149, 150, and 50, Parish of Kopuru, as the same are shown on a plan deposited in the office of the Chief Surveyor at Auckland under Number 29481, and to do all other things necessary to give effect to the provisions of this section.

##### 4 Validating a Warrant and Orders in Council relating to Allotment 142, Kopuru Parish, North Auckland Land District
    
*   Whereas by Proclamation published in the _Auckland Provincial Government Gazette_ of 8 June 1870, Allotment 50, Parish of Kopuru, was reserved for the purposes of common-school education within the Province of Auckland, and by notice published in the _Gazette_ of 16 December 1878 the said reserve was apportioned for the purposes of primary education:
    
    And whereas by Warrant published in the _Gazette_ of 15 June 1893 a portion (now known as Allotment 142, Parish of Kopuru) of the said Allotment 50 was purported to have been reserved for public recreation, and by Orders in Council published in the _Gazette_ of 27 July 1893 the land so reserved was declared to be subject to the Public Domains Act 1881 and powers were delegated to the Chairman, Councillors, and Inhabitants of the Hobson County as the Kopuru Town Domain Board:
    
    And whereas there was no authority for the reservation of the said Allotment 142 for public recreation, and it is deemed expedient to validate the said Warrant and the said Orders in Council:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    The said Warrant in so far as it relates to Allotment 142, Parish of Kopuru, and the said Orders in Council are hereby validated and declared to have been lawfully made, and the District Land Registrar at Auckland is hereby empowered and directed to make such entries, alterations, and amendments in and to his records, and to do all other things necessary to give effect to the provisions of this section.

##### 5 Revoking the reservation over and the vesting of part Allotment 15, Karioi Parish, Auckland Land District, and redescribing and again reserving the said allotment and revesting portion thereof in the Raglan County Council
    
*   Whereas notices published in the _Gazette_ of 11 January 1883, and of 22 February 1883, set out respectively the temporary and permanent reservations of Allotment 15, Parish of Karioi, Auckland Land District, for the purposes of a pilot and signal station:
    
    And whereas by Order in Council made under the authority of [section 15][43] of the Reserves and other Lands Disposal and Public Bodies Empowering Act 1914, and published in the _Gazette_ of 4 March 1915, part of the said allotment was vested in the Raglan County Council:
    
    And whereas by Proclamation published in the _Gazette_ of 3 July 1924 an area of 17 perches and three-tenths of a perch, being part of the said allotment, was erroneously regarded as road and purported to have been closed, and by [section 59][44] of the Reserves and other Lands Disposal and Public Bodies Empowering Act 1924 was purported to have been added to the said allotment:
    
    And whereas a new survey, as shown on a plan numbered 24725 in the office of the District Land Registrar at Auckland, discloses that the area of the said allotment was erroneously shown in earlier surveys and it is desirable to revoke the said temporary and permanent reservations, the said Order in Council, and, in so far as it affects the said area of 17 perches and three-tenths of a perch, the said Proclamation, and to repeal the said sections 15 and 59, and to redescribe and again reserve the said allotment and revest portion thereof in the said County Council as from the date of the original vesting:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    (1) The said temporary and permanent reservations, the said Order in Council, and, in so far as it relates to the said area of 17 perches and three-tenths of a perch, the said Proclamation are hereby revoked.

    (3) The portion of the said allotment described in subsection (7) is hereby vested in the Raglan County Council in trust for the said purposes and shall be deemed to have been so vested since 4 March 1915:
    
    provided that if at any time a Harbour Board is constituted to control the Whaingaroa Harbour the said land shall be deemed to be vested in the Board in trust for the said purposes.
    
    (4) The District Land Registrar and Chief Surveyor at Auckland are hereby empowered and directed to make such entries, alterations, and amendments in and to their records, and to do all other things necessary to give effect to the provisions of this section.

*   Whereas the lands hereinafter described are reserved as endowments for primary education:

    And whereas the said lands are situated between various areas which have been set apart as permanent State forests:
    
    And whereas it is desirable that the said lands should be brought under the provisions of the Forests Act 1921--22 so that they may be administered and dealt with in all respects as permanent State forest:

    And whereas from the year following the said church authorities have remained in undisturbed possession and occupation of the said section:
    
    And whereas no title for the said section has ever been issued, and it is deemed equitable that the said section should be vested in the Waikato Diocesan Trust Board:

    And whereas the land was leased by the lessors to certain trustees for the Apostolic Church of Wellington (hereinafter called the _lessees_) for a term of years expiring on 31 March 1958:
    
    And whereas the lessees, on the acquisition of leasehold rights over the land, were wrongly of opinion that the said rights included perpetual rights of renewal of the lease, and caused a church building to be erected on the land:
    
    And whereas the lease includes no right of renewal and the said improvements will revert to the lessors at the termination of the lease:
    
    And whereas the lessees desire to surrender the current lease and obtain in lieu thereof a new lease with perpetual rights of renewal, but before a new lease may be granted the lessors are entitled to be paid the present value of their reversionary interest in the improvements:
    
    And whereas it is considered equitable that a new lease should be granted without the lessees being required to make or the lessors to demand payment in respect of the said improvements:

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Reserves and other Lands Disposal Act 1938\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 13 January 1984, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][65] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][66] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][67] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][68] and [17E][69] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
