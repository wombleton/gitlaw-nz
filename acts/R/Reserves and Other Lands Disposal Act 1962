    [Section 44][22] of the Reserves and Other Lands Disposal and Public Bodies Empowering Act 1924 is hereby amended by repealing subsection (2), and substituting the following subsection:

    provided that in no case shall the amount of compensation awarded under this section exceed the claimant's interest in the value of the land as determined by the said Board, as at the date specified in the Proclamation affecting the same, together with the value as at that date and as determined by the said Board of any improvements then existing on the land.

*   Whereas the land referred to in subsection (5) is vested in the Corporation of the Borough of Oamaru (in this section referred to as the **Corporation**) in trust for municipal purposes or for purposes of public utility:
    
    And whereas the Oamaru Borough Council has granted leases of parts of that land which purport to confer rights to successive renewals thereof:
    
    And whereas doubts have arisen as to the validity of these leases:
    
    And whereas to resolve these doubts it is desirable that provision be made for the land to be held as an endowment and that the leases be declared to have been lawfully issued:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    (1) Notwithstanding anything in the Reserves and Domains Act 1953, or in any other Act, the Minister of Lands may from time to time by notice in the _Gazette_ revoke the trust on which any part or parts of the land referred to in subsection (5) is held by the Corporation and declare such part or parts to be held by the Corporation in trust as an endowment for the general purposes of the Corporation.
    
    (2) As from the date of any notice issued under subsection (1) the land described in that notice shall be held by the Corporation as an endowment for the general purposes of the Corporation freed and discharged from all trusts and reservations theretofore affecting the same, but subject to all leases, easements, liens, encumbrances, and other restrictions existing and affecting the same at that date.
    
    (3) Any lease granted by the Corporation before the date of the commencement of this Act over any part of the land referred to in any notice issued under subsection (1) and any renewal of any such lease granted by the Corporation, whether before or after the date of the commencement of this Act, shall have effect as if the land comprised in the lease or in the renewal thereof had been held by the Corporation as an endowment for the general purposes of the Corporation at the time when the lease or the renewal thereof, as the case may be, was granted.
    
    (4) The District Land Registrar for the Otago Land Registration District is hereby authorised and directed to make such entries in the register books, to register such instruments, and to do all such other things as may be necessary to give effect to the provisions of this section.
    
    (5) The land to which this section relates is described as follows:
        
    *   (a) any land vested in the Corporation under the Oamaru Town Reserves Management Act 1869:
    
    *   (b) any land acquired by the Corporation in exchange for land vested in the Corporation under the Oamaru Town Reserves Management Act 1869:
    
    *   (c) any land vested in the Corporation for the purposes of public utility pursuant to the [Oamaru Town Hall and Gasworks Sites and Recreation Reserves Act 1875][43]:
    
    *   (d) Section 10, Block I, Town of Oamaru.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Reserves and Other Lands Disposal Act 1962\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 14 July 1988, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][44] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][45] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][46] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][47] and [17E][48] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
