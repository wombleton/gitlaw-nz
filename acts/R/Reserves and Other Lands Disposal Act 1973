    And whereas the land is no longer required as a site for a public library:
    
    And whereas the trustees wish to transfer the land by way of sale to the Mayor, Councillors, and Citizens of the City of Dunedin (in this section called _the Corporation_):
    
    And whereas the trustees have no power to so transfer the land:
    
    And whereas it is desired to confer such a power on the trustees:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:

    And whereas the land first and secondly described was so vested to be held as a public reserve, subject to the Reserves and Domains Act 1953, for the purposes of a hall and library situated on that land, or for any public hall or library that might thereafter be erected to replace the existing hall or library:
    
    And whereas the land thirdly described was so vested as an endowment, without power of sale, for the benefit of the existing hall and library, or for the benefit of any public hall or library that might thereafter be erected to replace the existing hall or library:
    
    And whereas the land thirdly described is presently used for farming:
    
    And whereas the Council wishes to sell the land thirdly described, and to invest the proceeds of the sale permanently, and to use the interest from the investments for the benefit of the hall and library, or for the benefit of any public hall or library erected to replace the existing hall or library:

    And whereas by Order in Council 171091 the Corporation was directed to sell the land secondly described in that subsection:
    
    And whereas none of the land has been subdivided, sold, leased, or otherwise disposed of:
    
    And whereas doubts have arisen as to the power of the Corporation to subdivide, develop, sell, or lease the land first and secondly described in that subsection or to pay any costs or expenses incurred in doing so:
    
    And whereas it is desired to remove such doubts by conferring that power on the Corporation by this section:
    
    And whereas it is also desired to provide for the application of the proceeds of all such subdivisions, developments, sales, and leases of any parts of the land:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    (1) Notwithstanding the [Airport Authorities Act 1966][18] or the Civil Aviation Act 1964 or any other enactment or rule of law, the Corporation shall hold, administer, and dispose of the land first and secondly described in subsection (11) in accordance with the provisions of this section.
    
    (2) The Corporation shall, as long as any parts of the land are still required for the purposes of an aerodrome, continue to hold those parts of the land for those purposes.
    
    (3) The Corporation may from time to time, with the prior consent in writing of the Minister of Civil Aviation and Meteorological Services, do any 1 or more of the following things in respect of any part of the land that is no longer required for the purposes of an aerodrome:
        
    *   (a) subdivide or re-subdivide it into lots:
    
    *   (b) lease it on such terms and conditions as the Corporation may think fit:
    
    *   (c) sell it by such method of sale and on such terms and conditions as the Corporation thinks fit, with or without any grants or reservations of easements or other rights or privileges in favour of the purchaser or the Corporation or any other person.
    
    (4) The Corporation may, in subdividing or re-subdividing any part of the land under subsection (3), construct or provide such public streets, service lanes, access ways, sanitary and water drains, water supplies, electric power lines or cables, and other services and public works, as it thinks necessary or desirable for the use, convenience, and enjoyment of the land subdivided or re-subdivided.
    
    (5) The Corporation may pay out of its Capital Reserve Account (known as the Bell Block Realisation Reserve Fund) all the costs and expenses incurred by it in subdividing, re-subdividing, leasing, or selling any parts of the land under subsection (3), or in doing any of the things specified in subsection (4).
    
    (6) The Corporation shall pay the net proceeds from the subdivision, development, sale, and lease of any parts of the land under subsection (3) into its Bell Block Realisation Reserve Fund.
    
    (7) The Corporation shall then apply those proceeds in recoupment of all costs and expenses paid from the Bell Block Realisation Reserve Fund under subsection (5).
    
    (8) After applying the proceeds in accordance with subsection (7), the Corporation shall divide the balance of the proceeds into 2 equal portions.
    
    (9) Without prejudice to section 13B of the Civil Aviation Act 1964, the Corporation shall pay the first portion of the balance of the proceeds to the Minister of Civil Aviation and Meteorological Services, who shall lodge it to the credit of the Consolidated Revenue Account.
    
    (10) The Corporation shall apply the other portion of the balance of the proceeds in reduction of any loans raised by the Corporation in connection with the acquisition and development of the airport at Brown Road, New Plymouth, and may apply any excess for any purpose for which it may lawfully apply any of its income.
    
    (11) This section relates to the following land:
    
    All that area of land in Taranaki County, Taranaki Land District, containing first 117.0047 hectares, more or less, being Part Kaipakopako No 1 Block (DP 1468), and Section 145, Part Section 73 (DP 153), Part Section 77 (DP 343), Part Section 78B and 79, Part Mangateranoho Stream Bed and Lots 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, DP 5331, being Sections 74, 75, and 76 Waitara West District situated in Blocks II and III, Paritutu Survey District, and being all the land contained in certificate of title, Volume 144, folio 11, Taranaki Land Registry, subject to a pipeline easement registered as Document Number 165446 in favour of the Natural Gas Corporation of New Zealand; and secondly 100.1518 hectares, more or less, being Part Sections 149 and 150 Waitara West District, and Section 17, Bell District, situated in Blocks II and III, Paritutu Survey District, and being the balance of the land contained in certificate of title, Register B2, folio 818, Taranaki Land Registry, subject to a compensation certificate 182595 under the provisions of section 17 of the Public Works Amendment Act 1948 affecting Section 150, Waitara West District.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Reserves and Other Lands Disposal Act 1973\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 15 November 2000, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][21] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][22] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][23] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][24] and [17E][25] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
