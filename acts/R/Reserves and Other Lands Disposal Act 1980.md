    And whereas it is desired to amend the scheme, by removing a provision that allows a reduction in the purchase price to be made where more than 25% of the purchase price is paid as a deposit, by providing for arbitration on the purchase price of land sold under the scheme, by providing for a reduction in the purchase price to be made in recognition of the value of the lessees' goodwill in the leases of the land, and by empowering the Land Settlement Board to determine the date as at which the determinations of the purchase price and goodwill are to be made:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:

    > 
    > 
    
    (2) [Section 16][33] of the Reserves and Other Lands Disposal Act 1977 is hereby amended by repealing subsections (6) and (7), and substituting the following subsections:
    
    > *   "(6) Where the District Field Officer declines to confirm the purchase price determined by the registered valuer under subsection (5), the purchase price shall be fixed by arbitration in accordance with the provisions of the Arbitration Act 1908\.
    > 
    > *   "(7) For the purposes of such arbitration subsection (6) shall be deemed to be a submission within the meaning of the Arbitration Act 1908 and the reference shall be deemed to be to 2 arbitrators, 1 to be a registered valuer appointed by the Council of the University, and the other to be a registered valuer appointed by the Director-General of Lands.
    > 
    > *   "(7A) The purchase price of any land to be sold under this section shall be reduced by the value (if any) of the purchaser's goodwill in any lease held by him over that land, as determined by the Commissioner of Crown Lands, Dunedin.
    > 
    > *   "(7B) Every determination of a purchase price or of goodwill under subsection (5) or subsection (6) or subsection (7A) shall be made as at a date determined by the Land Settlement Board, being a date not later than the date on which the agreement to sell the land is entered into under subsection (1)."

##### 15 Otago Harbour Board
    
*   Whereas the land to which this section relates was reclaimed by the Otago Harbour Board in or about 1917:
    
    And whereas the land has not been vested in the Board nor in any other person:
    
    And whereas the Board has purported to grant leases of some of the land:
    
    And whereas it is expedient that the land be vested in the Board and that the validity of the leases granted by the Board be confirmed:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    (1) The land to which this section relates is hereby vested in the Otago Harbour Board.
    
    (2) Every lease that has been granted by the Otago Harbour Board in respect of the land is hereby declared to be as valid as it would be if the land had been vested in the Board at the time when the lease was granted.
    
    (3) This section relates to all that piece of land situated in the Otago Land District, Dunedin City, comprising 1.7751 hectares, more or less, being Section 5 (formerly Part Otago Harbour) Block LXXVIII, Town of Dunedin, Otago Land District (SO Plan 19405).

##### 16 Repeal of Lands Improvement and Native Lands Acquisition Act 1894
    
*   Whereas the Lands Improvement and Native Lands Acquisition Act 1894 and certain regulations made under that Act are still in force:
    
    And whereas it appears that the provisions of that Act are spent:
    
    And whereas it is desirable to repeal that Act and the regulations made under that Act:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    (1) The Lands Improvement and Native Lands Acquisition Act 1894 is hereby repealed.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Reserves and Other Lands Disposal Act 1980\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 July 2000, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][34] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][35] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][36] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][37] and [17E][38] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
