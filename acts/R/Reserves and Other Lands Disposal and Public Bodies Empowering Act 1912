##### 21 Loan raised by Heretaunga Road Board to build bridge across the Ngaruroro River, at Pakowhai
    
*   Whereas, some twenty years since, the Heretaunga Road Board raised, under the Government Loans to Local Bodies Act 1886 \[_Repealed_\], a special loan of six thousand one hundred and seventy-three dollars and fifty-eight and one-third cents for the purpose of building a bridge across the Ngaruroro River, at Pakowhai, on the Hastings-Taradale Road, the said loan to be secured by debentures having a currency of twenty-six years from the first day of February, eighteen hundred and ninety-three, and bearing interest at the rate of five per centum per annum; and in order to provide the said interest the said Board struck a special rate of twenty-five ninety-sixths of a cent in the dollar on all rateable property within a part of the Heretaunga Road District---that is to say, an area lying to the southward of the Ngaruroro River, containing two thousand four hundred and forty acres, more or less, and comprising portions of the Heretaunga Block and the Karamu Reserve; bounded on the north-east by the Ohiwia Stream and the old bed of the Ngaruroro River, on the south-east by the Karamu Road, on the south-west by the Borough of Hastings, and on the north-west by Subdivision C of the Heretaunga Block: And whereas at the time when the said loan was raised there were only two ratepayers within the said area, of whom one owned property on both banks of the Ngaruroro River: And whereas on or about the thirtieth day of March, eighteen hundred and ninety-four, the Heretaunga Road District was merged in the County of Hawke's Bay, the said loan remaining a charge upon all rateable property within the said area: And whereas by a special order of the Council of the said county made on the twenty-fifth day of January, nineteen hundred, in pursuance of the Government Loans to Local Bodies Act Amendment Act 1899 \[_Repealed_\], the said loan was readjusted, and the currency of the said debentures was extended to forty-one years from the said first day of February, eighteen hundred and ninety-three, and the rate of interest payable in respect of the said debentures was reduced to three and one-half per centum per annum: And whereas the said Council now levies a special rate of five forty-eighths of a cent in the dollar on all rateable property within the area above described in order to provide interest on the said debentures at the rate last aforesaid: And whereas at the present time there are about ninety ratepayers within the said area, who are all accustomed to transact their business in the Town of Hastings and seldom have occasion to cross the said bridge, and it is inequitable that they alone should be burdened with the said special rate, seeing that they derive no greater benefit from the said bridge than is derived therefrom by the other inhabitants of the neighbourhood: And whereas the Hawke's Bay County Council is willing to defray out of its general account the yearly interest on the said debentures, and it is expedient that it should be empowered to defray the same accordingly: Be it therefore enacted as follows:---
    
    From and after the thirty-first day of March, nineteen hundred and thirteen, the said special loan of six thousand one hundred and seventy-three dollars and fifty-eight and one-third cents, or so much thereof as may for the time being remain unpaid, shall no longer be a charge on all or any rateable property within the area above described, and from and after the last-mentioned day no special rate shall in any year be levied upon any rateable property within the said area in order to provide interest, on the debentures issued as security for the said loan, but the said interest shall in each and every year during the currency of the loan be defrayed by the Council of the County of Hawke's Bay out of its general account, anything in the Local Bodies Loans Act 1908, or in any other statute to the contrary notwithstanding.
