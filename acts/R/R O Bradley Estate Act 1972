An Act to incorporate the Board of Control of the Orton Bradley Park
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    Whereas Reginald Orton Bradley late of Charteris Bay, farmer, died on 24 January 1943 having first made his last will together with 1 codicil thereto dated, respectively, 18 March 1939 and 20 September 1941, and the said will and codicil were duly proved in the Supreme Court of New Zealand at Christchurch on 11 February 1943 by Lionel Denis Cotterill the executor in the said will and codicil named:
    
    And whereas, after compliance with certain provisions of the said will which have been complied with and without prejudice to an annuity which has ceased to be payable and after the death of the last survivor of 2 sisters and 2 nephews all of whom have died with the exception of 1 nephew who now has a life interest in the estate of the said testator, the said will provides that so much of the residuary estate of the testator remaining at the death of the last survivor of such sisters and nephews should be held upon trust for the purposes of a National Park for the just benefit and enjoyment of the people of New Zealand to be known as and called the Bradley National Park of Canterbury subject to the provisions thereinafter appearing, it being the desire and intention of the testator that the whole of his farm at Charteris Bay comprising 1 612 acres 2 roods 29 perches, being the land comprised and described in certificates of title Volume 9B folio 871 and Volume 446 folio 112, Canterbury Land Registry, should be used as and form a park and that the remainder of his residuary estate should be utilised for improving and maintaining such park as thereinafter provided, the said park to be managed by or under the control of a Board of Control consisting of the following persons:
        
    *   (a) the chairman for the time being of the Mount Herbert County Council who should be the permanent chairman of the Board:
    
    *   (b) the President for the time being of the Canterbury Horticultural Society:
    
    *   (c) the President for the time being of the Automobile Association of Canterbury:
    
    *   (d) the Mayor for the time being of the Borough of Lyttelton:
    
    *   (e) the Mayor for the time being of the Borough of Sumner:
    
    *   (f) the Mayor for the time being of the Borough of New Brighton:
    
    *   (g) the chairman for the time being of the Akaroa County Council:
    
    *   (h) the curator for the time being of the Botanical Gardens of the City of Christchurch:
    
    And whereas the said Board is to follow the procedure indicated in the said will which contains an expression of desire that the Board should continue the planting of shrubs and trees or ornamental trees and shrubs for so many years and in such manner as the Board should consider desirable for the improvement of the Park: 
    
    And whereas the said will provides that it is the desire of the testator without imposing any legal obligation on the part of the Board or the trustees so to do that the Board and the trustees should after the death of the said sisters and nephews apply for leave to introduce a Bill to take all necessary steps to obtain the passing of an Act having for its objects the constitution of the Board as a corporate body, and the vesting of the Park, funds, and chattels in the Board, and the will provides that the trustees shall not sell the said farm property or any part thereof and the will empowers the trustees to carry on any farming business for such time as the trustees think fit:
    
    And whereas having regard to the expressed wish of the testator to incorporate a Board of Control as a body corporate with perpetual succession and a common seal but after consideration of the fact that the offices of Mayor of the Borough of Sumner, Mayor of the Borough of New Brighton, and the curator of the Botanical Gardens of the City of Christchurch have ceased to exist and for better carrying into effect the intentions of the testator it has been deemed advisable that alterations should be made in the constitution of the Board: 
    
    And whereas the name used in the said will has been found not to be permissible and the name the Orton Bradley Park has been substituted therefor:
    
    And whereas since the death of the said testator the said farm property has been enlarged by the purchase of an area of 21.7 perches comprised and described in certificate of title Volume 455 folio 209, Canterbury Land Registry, and 2 acres 32.5 perches comprised and described in certificate of title Volume 514 folio 247, Canterbury Land Registry:
    
    And whereas, although it may be possible for the objects of the Bill to be attained otherwise than by legislation, there is some doubt as to whether the Supreme Court would exercise its powers under the [Charitable Trusts Act 1957][26] to implement all the provisions of this Bill and, even if it did, whether it would be prepared to exercise those powers before the death of the last surviving life tenant:
    
    And whereas it is desirable that the appointment of members of the Board be made without delay after the death of the last surviving life tenant:
    
    And whereas the last surviving life tenant has consented to the provisions of the Bill.

    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][33] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][34] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][35] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][36] and [17E][37] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
