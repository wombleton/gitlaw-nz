An Act for the better regulating the future Marriages of the Royal Family.

_Most Gracious Sovereign_,
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    WHEREAS Your Majesty, from Your paternal affection to Your own family, and from Your Royal concern for the future welfare of Your people, and the honour and dignity of Your Crown, was graciously pleased to recommend to Your Parliament to take into their serious consideration, whether it might not be wise and expedient to supply the defect of the laws now in being; and, by some new provision, more effectually to guard the descendants of his late Majesty King George the Second, (other than the issue of Princesses who have married, or may hereafter marry, into foreign families) from marrying without the approbation of Your Majesty, Your heirs, or successors, first had and obtained; we have taken this weighty matter into our serious consideration; and, being sensible that marriages in the Royal Family are of the highest importance to the state, and that therefore the Kings of this Realm have ever been entrusted with the care and approbation thereof; and, being thoroughly convinced of the wisdom and expediency of what Your Majesty has thought fit to recommend, upon this occasion, we, Your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, do humbly beseech Your Majesty that it may be enacted; and be it enacted by the King's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same,

##### 1 No descendant of his late Majesty, Geo II (other than the issue of Princesses married, or who may marry into foreign families) shall be capable of contracting matrimony without the previous consent of His Majesty, His heirs, etc signified under the Great Seal, declared in Council, and entered in the Privy Council books. Every marriage of any such descendant, without such consent, shall be null and void
    
*   That no descendant of the body of his late Majesty King _George_ the Second, male or female, (other than the issue of Princesses who have married, or may hereafter marry, into foreign families) shall be capable of contracting matrimony without the previous consent of His Majesty, His heirs, or successors, signified under the Great Seal, and declared in Council, (which consent, to preserve the memory thereof, is hereby directed to be set out in the Licence and Register of Marriage, and to be entered in the books of the Privy Council); and that every marriage, or matrimonial contract, of any such descendant, without such consent first had and obtained, shall be null and void, to all intents and purposes whatsoever.

##### 2 In case any descendant of Geo II being above 25 years old, shall persist to contract a marriage disapproved of by His Majesty, such descendant, after giving 12 months notice to the Privy Council, may contract such marriage; and the same may be duly solemnized, without the previous consent of His Majesty; and shall be good; except both Houses of Parliament shall declare their disapprobation thereof.
    
*   Provided always, and be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, that in case any such descendant of the body of his late Majesty King _George_ the Second, being above the age of twenty-five years, shall persist in his or her resolution to contract a marriage disapproved of, or dissented from, by the King, His heirs, or successors; that then such descendant, upon giving notice to the King's Privy Council, which notice is hereby directed to be entered in the books thereof, may, at any time from the expiration of twelve calendar months after such notice given to the Privy Council as aforesaid, contract such marriage; and his or her marriage with the person before proposed, and rejected, may be duly solemnized, without the previous consent of His Majesty, His heirs, or successors; and such marriage shall be good, as if this Act had never been made, unless both Houses of Parliament shall, before the expiration of the said twelve months, expressly declare their disapprobation of such intended marriage.
