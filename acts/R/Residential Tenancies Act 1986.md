    *   (a) shall set out the terms of repayment of any rent in arrear or any other conditions attaching to the order; and
    
    *   (b) shall automatically take effect as a final termination order if the conditions are not complied with; and
    
    *   (c) shall lapse if the conditions are complied with.
    
    (2) The Tribunal may refuse to make an order under subsection (1) if, but only if, it is satisfied that the breach has been remedied (where it is capable of remedy), the landlord has been compensated for any loss arising from the breach, and it is unlikely that the tenant will commit any further breach of a kind to which this section applies.
    
    (3) It shall not be necessary for the landlord to give to the tenant notice of the landlord's intention to apply under this section for an order terminating the tenancy.
