An Act to make Provision for the Exchange, Sale, Reservation, and other Disposition of certain Reserves, Crown Lands, and Endowments, and to confer certain Powers on certain Public Bodies.

BE IT ENACTED by the General Assembly of New Zealand in Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:---

##### 1 Short Title
    
*   The Short Title of this Act is The Reserves and other Lands Sale, Disposal, and Enabling and Public Bodies Empowering Act 1901\.

##### 2 Part of reserve, Otamatea Survey District, declared Crown land
    
*   Whereas the western portion of section numbered 31, Block XVI, Otamatea Survey District, Land District of Auckland, containing by admeasurement twenty-eight acres and twenty-four perches, is part of a reserve for a **resting-place for travelling stock**, and is in the occupation of one Mrs Annie Scott, under an alleged arrangement with the original Maori owners: And whereas the said land is not required for the purpose for which it was reserved, because the remaining portion of the reserve is sufficient, and it is, moreover, entirely detached therefrom: Be it therefore enacted as follows:---
    
    The said land is hereby declared to be Crown land available for sale, lease, or disposal under the [Land Act 1948][73], and its amendments, but the Auckland Land Board may at its discretion sell or lease the whole or any portion of it to Mrs Annie Scott upon such terms, not inconsistent with the said Act, as it thinks fit.
    
    The Land Act 1892 (1892 No 37) was consolidated, as from 4 August 1908, by section 1(2) Land Act 1908 (1908 No 94). That Act was in turn repealed, as from 1 January 1925, by section 390 Land Act 1924 (1924 No 31). That Act was in turn repealed, as from 1 April 1949, by section [185(1)][74] Land Act 1948 (1948 No 64).
    
    The word ""Maori"" was substituted, as from 27 November 1947, for the word ""Native"" pursuant to section [2(2)][75] Maori Purposes Act 1947 (1947 No 59).

##### 3 School-site, Parish of Mata
    
*   Whereas section numbered 7A, Parish of Mata, Land District of Auckland, containing by admeasurement nine acres three roods and thirty-seven perches, was promised to the Auckland Education Board as a school-site, but was included in a grant of land to the Whangarei Harbour Board by section four of The Reserves Disposal and Exchange Act 1895: And whereas a school has been erected upon the land, and the Whangarei Harbour Board has consented to the transfer of the land to the Education Board: Be it therefore enacted as follows:---
    
    The Whangarei Harbour Board may transfer its interest in section numbered 7A, Parish of Mata, Land District of Auckland, containing by admeasurement nine acres three roods thirty-seven perches, to the Auckland Education Board, to be held by the Board in fee-simple in trust as a site for a public school.

##### 4 Borough of Grey Lynn boundaries extended
    
*   The Borough of Grey Lynn is hereby extended to include all that area in the Land District of Auckland, containing by admeasurement about twenty-two acres, situated in the Waitemata Survey District, below high-water mark of the sea. Bounded towards the north, east, and south generally by high-water mark of Cox's Creek; and towards the north-west by the road and bridge across the said Cox's Creek.

##### 5 Reservation of school-site, Parish of Waipipi, cancelled
    
*   Whereas Lot 37 of Section 4, Parish of Waipipi, containing by admeasurement five acres, more or less, is an education reserve, and, as other land has been set apart for a public-school site, it is no longer wanted for the purpose: Be it therefore enacted as follows:---
    
    The reservation of lot numbered 37 aforesaid as a school-site is hereby cancelled, and it is hereby resumed as Crown land, and the Governor may dispose of the land in such a manner as he may deem desirable or necessary.

##### 6 Power to sell part of road reserve to John Kelly, Awakino
    
*   The Auckland Land Board may sell to John Kelly, of Awakino, a portion of a road reserve on the bank of a stream adjoining his land at Awakino, not exceeding in area one acre two roods, at a price to be fixed by the Board: Provided, however, that the Board shall be satisfied that the said John Kelly has no suitable site on his own land for a homestead, and that no injury will accrue to the public by reason of the sale of the reserve.

##### 7 Power to John Elliot to obtain fresh lease of land, Awakino
    
*   Whereas John Elliot is the present holder of a lease of seven hundred and seventy-two acres of land, being part of Section 2 of Block V, Awakino District, for the term of twenty-five years, with a right of purchase at one dollar an acre: And whereas the said land was (with other land) included in a prior lease held by his son Ambrose Elliot for a period of thirty years, with a right of purchase at seventy-five cents an acre: And whereas the prior lease was cancelled by the Auckland Land Board by reason of a technical informality in the application therefor: And whereas the purchasing-price of the present lease was fixed at one dollar an acre: And whereas it is equitable that the said John Elliot should be placed in the same position as that held by his son: Be it therefore enacted as follows:---
    
    The said John Elliot shall be entitled to surrender the present lease and obtain from the Auckland Land Board a fresh lease of the land, for the same term and subject to the same conditions as the present lease, save that there shall be a right of purchase at the rate of seventy-five cents an acre, and that the rental shall be computed on that basis; and the said Board is hereby empowered and directed to accept such surrender and grant such fresh lease accordingly.
    
    The expressions ""one dollar"" and ""seventy-five cents"" were substituted, as from 10 July 1967, for the expressions ""ten shillings"" and ""seven shillings and sixpence"" pursuant to section [7(1)][76] Decimal Currency Act 1964 (1964 No 27).

##### 8 Site for Wesleyan Methodist Church, Paeroa
    
*   Whereas sections numbered 8, 9, 10, and 11, of Block G1, fronting Normanby and Arney Streets, in the Town of Paeroa, Land District of Auckland, containing by admeasurement one rood eighteen perches, or thereabouts, were granted by the Maori owners to the Wesleyan Methodist Church, in or about the year one thousand eight hundred and eighty, which body has erected a church thereon; but such land was afterwards demised by the Maori, with other land, ultimately to Messrs Cassrells and Bennett, who, recognising the right of the Wesleyan Methodist Church, granted a sublease of the land to that body at a peppercorn rent, which sublease will terminate on the first day of February, one thousand nine hundred and ten: And whereas the fee-simple of the land is now in His Majesty, to whom also Messrs Cassrells and Bennett have surrendered their interests therein, and it is desirable that a permanent title should be issued in accordance with the original intention of the Maori owners: Be it therefore enacted as follows:---
    
    The Governor may grant in fee-simple the said land to the trustees of the Wesleyan Methodist Church at Paeroa, to be held by them upon the trusts set forth in the Wesleyan Methodists' Model Deed of New Zealand, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-seven, mentioned in section [three][77] of The [Wesleyan Methodist Church Property Trust Act 1887][78].
    
    The word ""Maori"" was substituted, as from 27 November 1947, for the word ""Native"" pursuant to section [2(2)][75] Maori Purposes Act 1947 (1947 No 59).

##### 9 Authorising the issue of a title to Jonathan Swarbrick for land in Te Puke Block
    
*   Whereas by an Order in Council issued on the twenty-seventh January, one thousand eight hundred and eighty, special terms and conditions for the disposal of the Te Puke Block were made, providing that George Vesey Stewart, as selector of the said block, was to introduce two hundred adult immigrants, to whom land orders were to be issued countersigned by the Agent-General in London; the selector and the settler or immigrant were to be jointly responsible for the fulfilment of certain conditions of settlement (which were that forty dwellinghouses were to be erected within twelve months, that each settler was to continuously reside on his holding until the first day of January, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-six, and cultivate one-fifth of his land), and that on the completion of the purchase by any settler he would be entitled to a grant: And whereas Jonathan Swarbrick was accepted as a settler of forty acres of the block, and selected Section No 4, Block IX, Maketu Survey District, but failed to comply with the specified conditions within the time required, and the fulfilment of such conditions was, by instructions of the Government, waived, but without due authority of law: Be it therefore enacted as follows:---
    
    Notwithstanding anything contained in the said Order in Council, or agreement, or otherwise, the Governor may, by warrant, direct that a certificate of title may be issued to the said Jonathan Swarbrick for the said section of land.
