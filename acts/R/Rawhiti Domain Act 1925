    The Public Reserves and Domains Act 1908 (1908 No 156) was repealed, as from 1 April 1929, by section 103 Public Reserves, Domains, and National Parks Act 1928 (1928 No 36). That Act was in turn repealed, as from 1 April 1954, by section 107(1) Reserves and Domains Act 1953 (1953 No 69). That Act was in turn repealed, as from 1 April 1978, by section [125(1)][7] Reserves Act 1977 (1977 No 66).

    (2) The Governor-General is hereby declared, with respect to such lands, to be a leasing authority within the meaning of the Public Bodies' Leases Act 1908, but in the exercise of the powers of a leasing authority he shall grant leases only on the tenancies set out in paragraphs (c) and (d) of section five of that Act.
    
    (3) Nothing in this Act shall exclude or restrict the right of any lessee or any person claiming through a lessee to obtain relief against forfeiture or determination of a lease granted under this Act in the same cases and on the same conditions as if the lease had been granted otherwise than by the Crown and in execution of statutory powers in that behalf.
    
    (4) The powers conferred by this Act shall be in addition to and not in substitution for any other existing powers of leasing the said lands.

##### 3 Application of revenues from leases under this Act
