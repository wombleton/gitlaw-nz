##### 7 Acknowledgements of the Crown relating to Rongowhakaata
    
*   (1) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) it has failed to address until now the longstanding and legitimately held grievances of Rongowhakaata in an appropriate manner; and
    
    *   (b) its recognition of, and redress for, the bitter grievances of Rongowhakaata is long overdue; and
    
    *   (c) the sense of grief and loss suffered by, and the impact on, Rongowhakaata remains today.
    
    (2) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) prior to 1865, Rongowhakaata had full control over their lands and resources and were participating successfully in the New Zealand economy; and
    
    *   (b) when war broke out in other regions before 1865, Rongowhakaata adopted a policy of neutrality; and
    
    *   (c) the Crown used military force in Tūranga in November 1865 when there was no need to do so; and
    
    *   (d) the Crown did not pursue all reasonable possibilities for preserving peace in Tūranga after it issued an ultimatum to the occupants of Waerenga a Hika in November 1865; and
    
    *   (e) the Crown's attack on Waerenga a Hika, whose occupants included women and children, was unwarranted and unjust, caused severe and long-term prejudice to Rongowhakaata, and breached the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles.
    
    (3) The Crown acknowledges that looting by its military forces in the aftermath of the Waerenga a Hika attack contributed to acute food shortages, which caused some loss of life among Tūranga Māori.
    
    (4) The Crown acknowledges that the indefinite detention in harsh conditions of many Rongowhakaata on the Chatham Islands without the laying of charges or bringing them to trial---
        
    *   (a) was an injustice that deprived those Rongowhakaata of basic human rights; and
    
    *   (b) inflicted unwarranted hardships on them and their whānau and hapū; and
    
    *   (c) also inflicted severe hardship on Rongowhakaata who remained in Tūranga; and
    
    *   (d) could not be legally challenged because of several indemnity acts; and
    
    *   (e) was wrongful, contrary to natural justice, and a breach of the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles.
    
    (5) The Crown acknowledges that, after being held for more than 2 years with no indication of when they might be released, the prisoners were justified in finally escaping from the Chatham Islands in July 1868, and that they had reason to distrust the Crown when it asked them to lay down their arms after their return to the mainland. 
    
    (6) The Crown further acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) the Crown's senior military officers at Ngatapa were aware that men captured during the Crown's pursuit of those who fled from the Whakarau Pa were being summarily executed; and
    
    *   (b) some Rongowhakaata who were prisoners of the Whakarau at Ngatapa were very likely to have been killed during the fighting, or to have been summarily executed by Crown forces after the pa was captured; and
    
    *   (c) the Crown did not investigate the events at Ngatapa in 1869, despite newspaper reports of a large number of summary executions by Crown forces after the battle; and
    
    *   (d) the summary executions at Ngatapa by Crown forces in January 1869 breached the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles, and tarnished the honour of the Crown.
    
    (7) The Crown acknowledges that the deaths of many Rongowhakaata at Ngatapa in January 1869 had a severe long-term impact on Rongowhakaata.
    
    (8) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) it did not obtain, or even seek, the consent of many Rongowhakaata for the 1868 deed of cession; and
    
    *   (b) the consent to the deed by its Rongowhakaata signatories was given under duress; and
    
    *   (c) the pressure applied by the Crown when negotiating for the cession, and the resulting extinguishment of all Rongowhakaata's customary land interests, breached the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles.
    
    (9) The Crown acknowledges that it did not secure Rongowhakaata's agreement to the boundaries of the land retained by the Crown out of the area Rongowhakaata ceded under duress in 1868, and that the Crown's effective confiscation of all Rongowhakaata interests in the more than 50 000 acres the Crown retained at Patutahi was wrongful and a breach of the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles. 
    
    (10) The Crown acknowledges that it broke its promise in the 1868 deed to compensate loyal Māori for their interests in any land retained by the Crown, and this was a breach of the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles. 
    
    (11) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) the Crown directed the Poverty Bay Commission to exclude those whom the Commission considered rebels from the titles it awarded for land ceded to the Crown in 1868 which was returned to Rongowhakaata between 1869 and 1873; and
    
    *   (b) the Crown arranged the preparation of a list naming many Rongowhakaata as rebels before the Commission sat, and this led to the exclusion of many Rongowhakaata from titles that the Poverty Bay Commission awarded for Rongowhakaata lands without adequate consideration by the Commission of whether they were actually rebels; and
    
    *   (c) the effective confiscation from many Rongowhakaata of land interests by their exclusion from titles awarded by the Poverty Bay Commission, and the Crown's failure to provide reserves for these Rongowhakaata, was wrongful and breached the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles.
    
    (12) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) the Crown did not consult Rongowhakaata about the individualisation of titles by the Poverty Bay Commission, or the introduction of the native land legislation; and
    
    *   (b) the awarding of titles to individuals by the Poverty Bay Commission and the Native Land Court made Rongowhakaata lands more susceptible to partition, fragmentation, and alienation; and
    
    *   (c) this had a prejudicial effect on Rongowhakaata because they contributed to the erosion of traditional tribal structures, which were based on collective tribal and hapū custodianship of land. The Crown failed to take adequate steps to protect those structures and this was a breach of the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles.
    
    (13) The Crown acknowledges that it failed to enact legislation before 1894 that facilitated the administration of Rongowhakaata land subject to the native land laws on a community basis and this was a breach of the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles. 
    
    (14) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) some Rongowhakaata land became vested in the East Coast Trust; and
    
    *   (b) its failure to provide for Rongowhakaata beneficial owners to be involved in the development of policy for the administration of their land once it became clear that this Trust would have a long-term existence was a breach of the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles.
    
    (15) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) it compulsorily acquired land from Rongowhakaata under public works legislation on a number of occasions; and
    
    *   (b) it took land for roads between 1862 and 1927 without paying compensation; and
    
    *   (c) there was insufficient justification for takings at Awapuni and Waiohiharore in 1900 and 1902; and
    
    *   (d) there was generally inadequate consultation with Rongowhakaata about public works takings before the middle of the twentieth century.
    
    (16) The Crown acknowledges the distress caused by the Manutuke consolidation scheme in the years following 1958 as it required many Rongowhakaata to exchange land to which they had significant ancestral connections for land to which they had no connections.
    
    (17) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) the clearing of indigenous forests in Tūranga between 1890 and 1920 dramatically increased erosion, which led to severe flooding on the Tūranga flats in the middle of the twentieth century; and
    
    *   (b) the pollution of Tūranga waterways by Gisborne's sewerage system and industrial waste has had a severe effect on Rongowhakaata, including the loss of many traditional sources of kai moana; and
    
    *   (c) Rongowhakaata have lost control over many of their significant sites, including wāhi tapu, and that this has had an ongoing impact on their physical and spiritual relationship with their land.
    
    (18) The Crown acknowledges that the cumulative effect of the Crown's actions and omissions, including the effective confiscation of land at Patutahi, and the individualisation of Rongowhakaata's land tenure through the operation of the Poverty Bay Commission and native land laws, left Rongowhakaata virtually landless and had a devastating effect on their economic, social, and cultural development. The Crown's failure to ensure that Rongowhakaata retained sufficient lands for its present and future needs was a breach of the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles.
    
    (19) The Crown acknowledges the harmful effects of a State education system that for too long did not value Māori cultural understanding, discouraged the use of te reo Māori, and held generally low expectations for Māori academic achievement.
    
    (20) The Crown acknowledges that Rongowhakaata have lived for too long with poorer housing, lower educational achievements, and worse health than many other New Zealanders.
    
    (21) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) Rongowhakaata have made a significant contribution to the wealth and development of the nation; and
    
    *   (b) Rongowhakaata have honoured their obligations and responsibilities under the Treaty of Waitangi in many ways, including their contribution to New Zealand's war efforts overseas. The Crown pays tribute to the contribution made by Rongowhakaata to the defence of the nation.
    
    

##### 8 The Crown's apology to Rongowhakaata
    
*   (1) The Crown profoundly regrets its breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles, and the devastating impact these have had on Rongowhakaata. 
    
    (2) The Crown acknowledges that its relationship with Rongowhakaata has involved some of the darkest episodes in our country's history. The Crown recognises that Rongowhakaata have long sought to right the injustices they have suffered at the hands of the Crown, and is deeply sorry that it has failed until now to address the injustices in an appropriate manner.
    
    (3) The Crown is deeply remorseful about the oppression of Rongowhakaata in the 1860s, which began with the Crown's attack on Waerenga a Hika. The many Rongowhakaata deaths at Waerenga a Hika, and the exile of many Rongowhakaata to the Chatham Islands, were great injustices. These events led to dishonourable summary executions of Rongowhakaata at Ngatapa, and an effective confiscation of Rongowhakaata land which was unjustified. The Crown unreservedly apologises for these actions, and for the enormous suffering they caused.
    
    (4) The Crown sincerely apologises for its failures since 1840 to respect Rongowhakaata rangatiratanga, and profoundly regrets that over the generations to the present day its actions have significantly impacted on their social and traditional structures, autonomy, and ability to exercise their customary rights and responsibilities.
    
    (5) The Crown is deeply sorry and unreservedly apologises for the destructive impact and demoralising effects of its actions, which have caused significant damage to the cultural, spiritual, and physical wellbeing of Rongowhakaata, as well as their economic development.
    
    (6) The Crown seeks to restore its tarnished honour with this settlement. The Crown hopes that this settlement will mark the beginning of a new relationship with Rongowhakaata founded on the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles. 

##### 9 Acknowledgements of the Crown relating to Ngā Uri o Te Kooti Rikirangi
    
*   (1) The Crown acknowledges that several Crown actions provoked Te Kooti Rikirangi into taking up arms against the Crown. In October 1865, a Crown officer was responsible for the summary execution of the Tūranga Rangatira Pita Tamaturi during fighting on the East Coast.
    
    (2) In November 1865, Crown military forces launched an unjustified attack on Waerenga a Hika. Te Kooti was part of the Crown forces at Waerenga a Hika, but was afterwards arrested on suspicion of being a spy. Ngā Uri o Te Kooti Rikirangi consider that, to remove one of his economic rivals from Tūranga, an influential Pākehā trader persuaded the Crown to arrest Te Kooti. The Crown initially released Te Kooti for lack of evidence, but rearrested him in March 1866 without charging him.
    
    (3) Te Kooti persistently requested to be put on trial but the Crown did not put him on trial. The Crown exiled Te Kooti to the Chatham Islands where he was detained without trial in harsh conditions for more than 2 years along with other prisoners. Crown officials told Te Kooti and the other prisoners sent to the Chatham Islands they would not be released until the Crown had settled how much land it would confiscate in Tūranga as a consequence of Waerenga a Hika. The Crown acknowledges that it was reasonable in these circumstances for Te Kooti to lead the escape of prisoners from the Chatham Islands in July 1868\.
    
    (4) Te Kooti intended to travel peacefully to Taupo when he led the prisoners back to the mainland. The Crown acknowledges that its unjust treatment of Te Kooti gave him reason to distrust the Crown when he was offered the chance to peacefully return to Tūranga after his arrival back on the mainland.
    
    (5) Te Kooti rejected a Crown requirement for his followers to lay down their arms, but only started to fight after being attacked by Crown forces when he began heading towards Taupo. He then accepted a take that originated with Raharuhi Rukupo to exact utu on the Crown officer responsible for the death of Pita Tamaturi before raiding Tūranga in November 1868\.
    
    (6) The most important event in the stigmatisation of Te Kooti is the November 1868 raid on Matawhero during which more than 50 people were summarily executed. Colonel Whitmore, who was in command at Ngatapa in January 1869 when many Tūranga Māori were summarily executed by Crown forces, later said that all Te Kooti's acts were committed ""in fair war and did not contravene Māori custom in war"". The Crown acknowledges that this attack took place in a time of war, and, as is sometimes the case in war, both sides were guilty of such actions. However, nothing can justify the summary executions that took place at Matawhero, Ngatapa, and other places.
    
    (7) In 1869 and 1870, the Crown effectively confiscated Te Kooti's land interests in the Tūranga flats. The Crown also offered a bounty of £1,000 for the capture of Te Kooti, dead or alive. In 1870 this bounty was increased to £5,000\. Crown forces pursued Te Kooti across the North Island, and many members of different iwi were killed during this pursuit. It was marked by the use of scorched earth tactics, which caused enormous suffering for many of those who were associated with Te Kooti during the Crown's pursuit. The Crown only ceased the pursuit in 1872 after Te Kooti was given refuge in Kingitanga territory.
    
    (8) In 1883, the Crown included Te Kooti in a general amnesty for Māori who had fought against it during the New Zealand Wars. However, Te Kooti was never able to return to Tūranga. In 1889, the Crown arrested Te Kooti when he tried to return to Tūranga, and a large armed party from Tūranga and the East Coast region assembled to block his progress. Te Kooti was denied legal representation, and a Resident Magistrate convicted him of disturbing the peace. Te Kooti was briefly imprisoned when he could not pay the excessive surety required for his bail. Te Kooti successfully appealed his conviction to the Supreme Court. However, his conviction was reinstated by the Court of Appeal where one of the Judges made racist remarks about Te Kooti.
    
    (9) Te Kooti's inability to return to Tūranga prevented him from participating in Native Land Court hearings in Tūranga, and he was not included in any of the legal titles for lands which were awarded by the Court sitting in Tūranga. His descendants were deprived of much of their ancestral lands.
    
    (10) Te Kooti died in 1893, and his whānau record that his descendants have been physically attacked, spat at on the street, and ridiculed in public. This has also occurred in schools where Te Kooti's descendants have commonly felt alienated in history lessons which have not addressed the motivations of Te Kooti in a fair and balanced manner. Some of his whānau have had to move districts for their safety.

##### 10 The Crown's apology to Ngā Uri o Te Kooti Rikirangi
    
*   (1) The Crown unreservedly apologises for its actions, which led to Te Kooti taking up arms, and contributed to the stigmatisation of Te Kooti and his descendants.
    
    (2) The Crown acknowledges that Te Kooti founded Te Haahi Ringatu and became highly respected and revered by many Māori and Pākehā because of the symbolic leadership that this represented for Māori in terms of spirituality and preservation of te reo me ōna tikanga. The Crown recognises the positive contributions of Te Kooti to New Zealand culture through Te Haahi Ringatu. It acknowledges that Te Kooti was instrumental in promoting the construction of many wharenui throughout the country, which helped strengthen the identity and culture of all of those iwi who he assisted. The Crown recognises that Te Kooti's innovative artistic style promoted greater freedom of expression in modern Māori art. The Crown acknowledges that Te Kooti represents a spiritual and cultural figurehead for many Māori and Pākehā alike.
    
    (3) The Crown hopes that this settlement will help to foster a wider appreciation of Te Kooti's legacy in New Zealand society.
