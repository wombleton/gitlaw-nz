That scheme will produce and develop electrical energy of a quantity considerably in excess of that which will probably be required by the Board for the purposes of the Board's said district, and is estimated to produce a supply which will be available for other districts as well as for the district of the Board.

##### 5
    
*   The cost of construction of the Arapuni works has been estimated to exceed the sum of two million eight hundred thousand dollars, and the expenditure would extend over six years. Unless it were clear that the district of the Board would take the whole of its supply of electrical energy from the Arapuni scheme it would not be prudent or reasonable to enter upon works of such magnitude. The essential element in the determination by the Minister of the initiation of the Arapuni scheme is the certainty that revenue will be derived for a definite period of at least ten years from the State supply to the Board's district, which comprises the most important portion of the area to which it would be possible or convenient to supply energy from the Arapuni scheme. For that reason the Minister has, before determining to initiate the Arapuni scheme, found it necessary to invite the Board to elect between the alternative powers conferred upon it by the said section 58\.
    
    The reference to ""two million eight hundred thousand dollars"" was substituted, as from 10 July 1967, for a reference to ""one million four hundred thousand pounds"" pursuant to section [7(1)][219] Decimal Currency Act 1964 (1964 No 27).

##### 6
    
*   The Board has determined and notified to the Minister that the Board elects to adopt the alternative method defined in paragraph (d) of the said section 58, and consequently that the Board is prepared to enter into the agreement expressed in Part [II][336] hereof to purchase the whole supply of electrical energy to be used or distributed or sold for distribution by the Board within the district of the Board from the Minister for the definite period named, the source of such supply being the Arapuni scheme: Provided that in the event of the failure of the Minister to provide the whole supply of electricity required to be used or distributed, or sold for distribution by the Board, the Board may operate its plant to the extent required to equalize the deficiency in supply by the Minister.

##### 7
    
*   The Minister in consequence of, and in consideration of, that election and agreement of the Board has agreed to commence and proceed with the Arapuni scheme, and has further agreed that the Board shall have the first right to the electrical energy supplied from the Arapuni scheme, to the intent and effect that the requirements of the Board for electrical energy to be supplied by the Board within the district of the Board shall be first fully provided from the Arapuni scheme in priority to sales of electrical energy to be made by the Minister of the surplus energy developed by the Arapuni scheme.

##### 8
    
*   On the part of the Minister the inducement to commence and proceed with the Arapuni scheme is the certainty of revenue for a definite period from the supply to the Board of the whole of the Board's requirements for its district. On the part of the Board the inducements to draw its whole supply from the Arapuni scheme, and to await the completion of the Arapuni scheme, are, firstly, the right to the Board of the first call for its requirements from this source of supply; and, secondly, that the capital expenditure upon power-works and thence to the point of delivery will be at the cost of the Government and not of the Board.

##### 9
    
*   But the Minister cannot lawfully enter into absolute obligations on behalf of His Majesty which involve expenditure over a period of approximately six years. Nor is it clear that the Board can under its present statutory powers enter into the definite engagement on its part expressed in Part [II][336] hereof so as effectually to bind the Board for the long period of years involved. Therefore both parties to this agreement agree to endeavour to obtain a statutory ratification of this agreement by Parliament during the next ensuing session. And though it is intended that preliminary steps shall be taken by the Minister in anticipation of such confirmation, it is agreed by both parties that this agreement cannot be absolutely binding upon either of them unless it shall be so ratified.

##### 10
    
*   It is expressly stated and understood that the obligation of the Minister to commence and proceed with the Arapuni scheme and to be ready to supply electrical energy therefrom in the year 1928 may be interfered with or prevented by events of various kinds. It may be found later that the scheme is rendered impracticable by earthquake or otherwise. It may be found impossible for the Government to provide in any year the necessary funds for the work. Strikes may occur or other labour difficulties. Such events or others now unforeseen, whether of a similar or a different nature to those detailed in this paragraph, may delay or wholly prevent the completion of the work. The Board shall not at any time have any claim for damages or pecuniary compensation against His Majesty or the Minister or the Government of New Zealand in respect of any such prevention or delay. The right or remedy of the Board in any such event shall be to claim to determine this agreement subject to the conditions defined in this paragraph of this preamble, that is to say,---
        
    *   (a) If the completion of the works of the Arapuni scheme is prevented, or if delay in the completion of such works occurs to an extent which the Board considers unreasonable, the Board may give notice to the Minister that it desires to terminate the agreement.
    
    *   (b) If the Minister objects to such determination, then the question whether it is reasonable and just, having regard to all the circumstances, that the Board should have such right to determine shall be referred to the arbitration and determination of three arbitrators, one to be appointed by the Minister, another by the Board, and the third to be chosen by the said two arbitrators.
    
    *   (c) If, after hearing such evidence as they think fit to take, the said three arbitrators, or a majority of them, determine that it is reasonable and just, having regard to all the circumstances, that the Board should have such right to determine, then, and not otherwise, the Board may determine this agreement, and thereby each party shall cease to be bound thenceforth by the terms and conditions thereof.
    
    

##### 11
    
*   The arbitration clause in Part [II][336] hereof relates to matters of difference which may arise after the commencement of supply of electrical energy to the Board by the Minister, and is inapplicable to the matters in respect whereof arbitration may be required under the last preceding clause of this preamble.

##### 12
    
*   It is agreed that in the Act ratifying this agreement there shall be included a provision conferring specific power upon the High Court of New Zealand to enforce, by injunction, mandamus, or other appropriate remedy, compliance with the performance of the agreement and conditions expressed or implied in this agreement in addition to or alternative to damages for breach of the agreement.
    
    The words ""High Court"" were substituted, as from 1 April 1980, for the words the ""Supreme Court"" pursuant to section [12][234] Judicature Amendment Act 1979 (1979 No 124).

## II  
Auckland Electric-Power Board Agreement

##### 1 Interpretation
    
*   In the interpretation of this agreement,---
        
    *   (a) The term _Electrical Engineer_ shall mean the Electrical Engineer of the Public Works Department appointed by the Minister in this behalf, or in his absence, temporarily or otherwise, his deputy or assistant.
    
    *   (b) Where notice is required to be given by or to the Minister it shall be sufficient if given by or to the Electrical Engineer.
    
    *   (c) The marginal notes of this agreement are explanatory, and shall not be deemed to be part of the agreement or to modify or affect the meaning thereof.
    
    

##### 2 Duration of agreement
    
*   This agreement shall come into effect on the date of execution by the Board, and shall continue for a period of ten years from the date of commencement of supply of electricity hereunder, and thereafter shall be continued subject to it being determined by either party giving to the other twelve calendar months' notice in writing from the first day of any quarter.
    
    This agreement shall continue and remain in force notwithstanding that the Board may part with the ownership or possession of the Board's premises, property, or authority.

##### 3 Supply
    
*   The Minister shall commence and shall with all reasonable expedition continue and carry to completion the development of the hydro-electric works at Arapuni on the Waikato River, Auckland Province, and shall erect transmission-lines to and a substation at Penrose for the provision of electricity to be supplied under this contract.
    
    It is contemplated that unless unforeseen difficulties occur the supply of electricity under this agreement should commence not later than the 1st day of April, 1928\. And the Minister agrees to endeavour to have the works and the substation and the intervening transmission-lines in working-order and ready for supply on or before that date. But the Minister does not engage or agree that the said works, substation, and lines shall be completed ready for supply on or before that date. When the works are nearing completion the Minister shall give to the Board at least six calendar months' written notice, naming a date at which the Minister will be ready to commence supply. The date so to be named is hereafter referred to as _the date of commencement of supply._
    
    From and after the date of commencement of supply the Board shall take the whole supply of electrical energy required by the Board for use or supply by the Board within the district of the Board (including all electrical energy required for the operation of the works taken over by the Board from the City of Auckland under the provisions of the Act of 1921-22) from the Minister at the said substation; and the Board shall not in any manner provide any other source of electrical energy for such use or supply, except only that the Board may have auxiliary or stand-by works to provide supply in the case of stoppage or insufficiency of supply by the Minister and only during such stoppage or insufficiency. The Minister shall from and after date of commencement of supply provide at the said substation the whole quantity of electrical energy required by the Board. Such supply shall be alternating current at a nominal periodicity of fifty cycles per second on the three-phase system at a nominal pressure of 11,000 volts, and such supply shall (subject to the provisions hereof) be available at all times.
    
    The range of periodicity shall not exceed 1 per cent above or below the frequency of fifty cycles, and the range of voltage shall not exceed 4 per cent above or below a pressure of 11,000 volts.

##### 4 Non-responsibility for interruption
    
*   The Minister shall exercise every effort to give a continuous supply of electricity, but shall not be held responsible for damage, loss, or inconvenience arising from any interruption or discontinuance of supply caused by accidents to mains, machinery, or other apparatus, _force majeure_, strikes, overload, alterations, repairs, or other causes, whether arising through default or negligence of the Minister's agents or servants or otherwise; but the Minister shall use every reasonable endeavour to quickly restore the supply.
    
    In the case of an interruption exceeding fifteen minutes in duration the charge to be paid for the quarter shall be reduced in the proportion that the period of the interruption bears to a period of 2,190 hours.

##### 5 Meters and testing
    
*   The quantity of energy supplied by the Minister to the Board under this agreement shall be registered by means of meters and indicators placed by the Minister at the point of supply. The Board shall have the right to install check meters and indicators. The amount of energy to be paid for by the Board shall be that recorded by the Minister's meter or indicator, provided the two meters or indicators do not differ by more than 2 1/2 per centum from each other. Should the meters or indicators differ by more than 2 1/2 per centum from each other, both shall be subject to a test by a competent authority or person to be appointed by the Minister, and shall be made in the presence of both parties. Either party shall have the right at any time to require that either or both of the meters or indicators shall be subject to test. Should either of the two meters or indicators upon being submitted to a test depart by more than 2 1/2 per centum on the average from the correct values, the expenses of testing such meters or indicators shall be borne by the party to whom the meter or indicator belongs; but if neither of the meters or indicators depart by more than 2 1/2 per centum from the correct values, then the cost of testing the meters or indicators shall be shared equally by both parties. Any claim that may arise in respect of the inaccurate registering of the meter or indicator shall be limited retrospectively to the quarter preceding that in which such claim is made. In the event of the meter or indicator installed by the Minister being proved to be inaccurate, the quantity of the electrical energy to be paid for by the Board shall be the correct amount as determined by the above test.

##### 6 Date of payment
    
*   All charges for the consumption of energy shall accrue as from day to day, and are payable on demand. Payment shall become due quarterly on the last days of June, September, December, and March.
    
    Accounts for such charges shall be rendered to the Board by the Electrical Engineer as early as possible after the above dates, and shall be paid on or before the last day of the month succeeding the dates upon which they become due.

##### 7 Minister providing equipment at point of supply
    
*   The Minister shall provide free of charge the necessary lines, transformers, and switch-gear at the point of supply to deliver electrical energy at a nominal voltage of 11,000 volts, and shall provide there such meters and indicators as may be necessary for the effective measuring of the energy to be supplied under this contract.
    
    One of the main busbars at the Penrose substation shall be dedicated to the supply to the Board, and the supply shall be metered on the main circuits between the transformers and this busbar.
    
    One 11,000-volt circuit-switch shall be provided by the Minister for each 3,000 kilowatts of the Board's maximum demand.
    
    The Board shall provide and install all the equipment necessary for distributing the electricity for the purposes contemplated by this agreement beyond these circuit-switches at the point of supply.
    
    All equipment and plant provided by the Board for switching, transforming, or converting the electricity supplied under this contract shall be approved by the Electrical Engineer before installation.

##### 8 Power factor
    
*   If the power factor of the Board's demand on the normal daily maximum load falls below 90 per cent, the Minister may require, and the Board shall within twelve calendar months install, the necessary apparatus to raise the power factor to the above value.

##### 9 Purposes for which energy is supplied
    
*   The purposes for which electricity is supplied under this agreement are for use by the Board, and for sale to consumers for lighting, heating, or power within the area within which the Board is authorized to supply electricity to consumers.

##### 10
    
*   From the date of commencement of supply the Board shall pay for the electricity supplied in the manner and at the rates provided in this paragraph:---
        
    *   (a) The Board shall, not less than one month before the date of commencement of supply, notify the Minister in writing of the election of the Board to pay and be charged at the rates specified in Schedule [B][337] or at the rates specified in Schedule [C][338] hereunder.
    
    *   (b) A similar notification of election shall be made by the Board not less than one month before the same day and month (being the day and month of the date of commencement of supply) in each succeeding year during the continuance of this agreement.
    
    *   (c) The rate and charge to be paid by the Board during each year shall be according to the Schedule named in the notice of election.
    
    *   (d) If the Board fails to duly notify its election in accordance herewith, the Board shall for the year for which it so fails be deemed to have elected to be charged and to pay at the rates defined in Schedule [B][337].
    
    *   (e) A year for the purposes of this clause commences at and ends on the day and month of the date of commencement of supply.
    
    *   (f) Wherever in any year the Board is by its election or by reason of its failure to duly notify its election charged at the rates specified in Schedule [B][337] the amount to be paid by the Board to the Minister for that year shall not be less than £105,000\. If at the end of any such year it shall appear that the amount paid or payable by the Board to the Minister for electricity supplied to the Board during such year at the rates specified in Schedule [B][337] is less than £105,000, the Board shall within one month after the end of such year pay to the Minister the difference so that the total amount paid by the Board for that year to the Minister shall be £105,000: Provided, nevertheless, that if in any such year the Board's requirements of supply are abnormally reduced by reason of strikes, lockouts, fires, earthquakes, the act of God, civil tumult, or inevitable accident, then for such year the Board shall not be required to pay such deficiency to the Minister.
    
    *   (g) If the date of commencement of supply shall be before the 1st day of April, 1928, then from the date of commencement of supply until the 1st day of April, 1928, the Board shall be charged and pay at the rates specified in Schedule [B][337], and in such case the preceding subparagraphs of this clause shall be modified as follows:---
            
        *   (i) In subparagraph [(a)][339] the words ""the 1st day of April, 1928,"" shall be substituted for the words ""the date of commencement of supply.""
        
        *   (ii) In subparagraph [(b)][339] the words ""the 1st day of April"" shall be substituted for the words ""the same day and month (being,"" etc).
        
        *   (iii) In subparagraph [(e)][339] the words ""the 1st day of April"" are substituted for the words ""the day and month of the date of commencement of supply.""
        
        
    
    

##### 11 Powers of entry, inspection, and removal
    
*   The Electrical Engineer or any officer approved of by the Minister may without let or hindrance from the Board or its servants at all reasonable times enter any premises to which electricity is or has been supplied by the Board in order to inspect the electric lines, meters, fittings, works, and apparatus for the supply of electricity, and for the purpose of ascertaining the quantity of electricity consumed or supplied.

##### 12 Temporarily cutting off supply
    
*   The Minister, on giving reasonable notice, shall be at liberty from time to time to temporarily cut off the supply at such times as he may consider necessary in the interests of the service, or for the purpose of testing the installation, or adding to or altering or repairing any mains or apparatus, and the Minister shall not be responsible for any claims or damages in respect of such temporary interruption; but such temporary interruption shall, if possible, be made at such hours as shall cause the least interference with the Board's business.

##### 13 Leakage of electricity
    
*   Should any leakage of electricity be discovered by the Board, the defective circuits must be cut off immediately, and steps must immediately be taken by the Board to remedy the defect.

##### 14 Defect affecting other consumers
    
*   If any defect exists on the lines or apparatus belonging to or under the control of the Board or belonging to any of the Board's consumers which in the opinion of the Electrical Engineer does or is likely to interfere with the supply of electrical energy to any other consumer, the Board shall at once cause such defect to be rectified; and if the Board fails to do so expeditiously such rectification may be undertaken by the Minister, and the Board shall pay the Minister the cost thereof.

##### 15 Way-leave
    
*   The Board shall give the Minister free of charge all way-leave facilities necessary for the erection or maintenance of poles, cables, wires, etc, required to be installed for the carrying-out of this agreement on or over any property owned by the Board or under its control, and will allow the Minister's officials or representatives to enter upon all such premises at all times for any purpose connected with this agreement.

##### 16 Non-interference with other supply
    
*   The Board shall not use the electricity supplied to it under this agreement or deal with the electricity in any manner so as to unduly or improperly interfere with the supply of electricity supplied to any other local authority, person, or consumer by the Minister, outside the district of the Board.

##### 17 Power of determination upon default
    
*   If the Board shall at any time make default in payment of any moneys payable hereunder for the space of thirty days next after any of the days whereon the same ought to be paid as aforesaid, or if the Board shall not in all things perform and observe the covenants and conditions hereinbefore contained, and on the part of the Board to be observed and performed, then and in any such case and in addition to any other right or power possessed by the Minister it shall be lawful for the Minister at any time thereafter, notwithstanding that the Minister may not have taken advantage of some previous breach or default or event of a like nature, to determine this agreement; but such determination shall not affect any right, claim, demand, or power which may have accrued to the Minister or be enforceable by him by virtue of these presents.

##### 18
    
*   Should the Minister fail to supply to the Board electricity required by the Board in terms hereof (except as provided in clauses [3][340], [4][341], or [12][342] hereof), then the Board shall be entitled, in addition and without prejudice to any other rights or remedies it may have against the Minister, to claim to determine this agreement, and the provisions of clause [10][343] of the preamble forming Part [I][344] of this agreement shall, _mutatis mutandis_, apply.

##### 19 Arbitration
    
*   If at any time any dispute, difference, or question shall arise between the said parties hereto touching the construction, meaning, or effect of these presents, or any clause or thing herein contained, or the rights or liabilities of the said parties respectively under these presents, or otherwise howsoever in relation to the premises, then every such dispute, difference, or question shall be referred to arbitration in manner prescribed by the Arbitration Act 1908, or any statutory modification or re-enactment thereof for the time being in force.

##### 20 Minister not to sell or supply
    
*   The Minister shall not nor shall any person by or under the authority of the Minister during the currency of this agreement sell or supply electricity to any person within the Board's district, including any Department of the Government or the Crown, except upon such terms as may be agreed upon between the Minister and the Board, provided that the Board shall, with due expedition and wherever the same may be required, supply to the Minister all such electricity as the Minister may from time to time require within the Board's district, and at rates not greater than the charges made to the public by the Board for a similar supply.

##### 4
    
*   The site for the power-house and the power-house erected thereon shall at all times be maintained by the Board at its own expense, and His Majesty shall not be under any liability on any account whatsoever in respect of the same or either of them.

##### 5
    
*   His Majesty shall make or construct a footpath or way 4 ft wide leading in a reasonably direct route from a point on the main road Roxburgh to Roxburgh East near the Teviot Bridge (shown on the said plan) up the south side of the Teviot Gorge to the site for the power-house, but shall not be responsible for the maintenance or repair of the same.

##### 6
    
*   His Majesty shall deliver to the Board at the site of the power-house and within 20 ft of the outer wall thereof such quantity of water not exceeding twenty-five heads as the Board may from time to time require for the development of electric power. The said water shall be delivered from a pipe having a diameter of 30 in, and in such manner as to secure approximately 380 ft of effective head at the point of delivery. All works necessary to enable the said water to be delivered in manner aforesaid shall be made and constructed by His Majesty.

##### 7
    
*   The Board shall be entitled to make a connection in the pipe-line constructed or to be constructed for the purposes of the said Teviot River irrigation works at the point on the north side of the Teviot River shown approximately by the letter **A** on the plan attached hereto, or at such other point as may be agreed upon between the parties hereto, and by means of such connection to draw a further quantity of water not exceeding twenty-five heads from the said pipe-line for use in developing electric power: Provided, however, that under this provision hereof the Board shall only be entitled to draw from the said pipe-line such quantity of water as shall not be required for the time being for irrigation purposes; and, further, that before drawing water in pursuance of this provision the Board shall on each and every occasion apply to and obtain permission so to do from the District Engineer of the Public Works Department at Dunedin, or from some other officer of the said Department or person appointed for this purpose by the said District Engineer.

##### 8

##### 12
    
*   His Majesty shall not make any adjustment of the valve controlling the quantity of water being delivered to the power-house, but the Board shall immediately, upon being requested so to do by His Majesty or by any authorized officer or servant of His Majesty, make any adjustment to such valve which may be necessary to secure that not more than twenty-five heads of water shall be delivered to the Board at the power-house.

##### 13
    
*   His Majesty shall be entitled at any time and from time to time to make any valve adjustment whereby the quantity of water running into the tail-race may be increased or diminished, provided that such adjustment shall not appreciably increase or diminish the quantity and pressure of water being supplied to the power-house for use by the Board.

##### 14
    
*   His Majesty shall pay to the Board the sum of £130 in respect of all claims, losses, costs, and expenses incurred by the Board in purchasing plant and machinery necessary for the power-house to be constructed as aforesaid in substitution for the plant and machinery already purchased by it under the contracts hereinbefore mentioned, and the Board shall accept the said sum of £130 in full satisfaction and discharge of all claims upon His said Majesty for or in respect of the said claims, losses, costs, and expenses.
