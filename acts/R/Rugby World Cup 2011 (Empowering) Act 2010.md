    *   (a) the Authority must proceed to make---
            
        *   (i) the preliminary determination under section 25 or 26; and

        *   (i) the Authority must proceed to deal with the application under [Part 3][24]; and
        
        *   (ii) the application to the relevant statutory person or body is to be treated as having been withdrawn from the relevant statutory person or body and must be transferred to the Authority in accordance with regulations made under this Act.
        
        
    
    (2) In determining whether an application is the same or substantially the same as the application lodged with the relevant statutory person or body, the Authority must take into account---
        
    *   (a) the duration of the activity or facility proposed in each application; and
    
    *   (b) any other matters the Authority considers relevant in the circumstances.
    
    (3) If the Authority proceeds to determine an application to which this section applies, it must notify the relevant statutory person or body that it is doing so.
    
    (4) If notice is given under subsection (3), the relevant statutory person or body must, without delay,---

    *   (b) cease to process the application.
    
    (5) However, if the Authority declines to grant an approval under this Part, the relevant statutory person or body must, if requested to do so by the applicant, reinstate the application and proceed to determine it as if the application had not been transferred to the Authority.
    
    (6) If subsection (5) applies,---
        
    *   (a) the application and documentation held by the Authority in relation to the application must be transferred without delay to the relevant statutory person or body; and
    
    *   (b) the statutory time limits applying to the relevant statutory person or body recommence from the date that the statutory body or person receives the documentation.
    
    (7) If the relevant statutory person or body is requested to reinstate and determine the application under subsection (5),--- 
        
    *   (a) it must treat the decision and reasons of the Authority as irrelevant for the purposes of the decision on the application; but
    
    *   (b) it may have regard to any other relevant information that is transferred under subsection (6)(a).
    
    

### Subpart 2---Jurisdiction, public notification, and making of submissions

##### 25 Preliminary consideration of applications
    
*   (1) The Authority must determine, in relation to every application made under subpart 1, whether the application meets the criteria set out in subsection (3). 
    
    (2) Before making that decision the Authority may request further information from the applicant, if it is satisfied that provision of the information will, in the circumstances, assist in the fair and timely determination of the application.
    
    ###### Criteria
    
    (3) The Authority must be satisfied that---

        *   (i) the Rugby World Cup 2011; or
        
        *   (ii) a test event; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) the applicant has undertaken all reasonably practicable measures to ensure that the necessary approval, declaration, test approval or declaration, or change to the conditions was obtained under the enactment or statutory planning instrument that would have applied, but for this Part, or that the application could not reasonably have been made at an earlier date; and
    
    *   (c) it is unlikely that, but for this Part, the application could be determined in time to enable the activity to be undertaken or the facility constructed for the Rugby World Cup 2011 or the test event, as the case may be.
    
    

##### 26 Preliminary consideration of applications relating to tournament venues

        *   (iii) on the New Zealand Fire Service.
        
        
    
    (2) However, subsection (1)(a) does not apply if the enactment or statutory planning instrument that would apply, but for this Act, makes no provision for public notice to be given of an application made under that enactment or statutory planning instrument. 
    
    (3) Despite subsection (2), the Authority may give public notice of an application to which that subsection applies if it considers that there are special circumstances that warrant public notice being given.
    
    (4) If public notice is not given, the Authority must, without delay, give written notice to the persons with a right to be heard, as provided for in [section 32(2)][46], of---

    (3) If leave is declined by the Supreme Court because exceptional circumstances have not been established under [section 14][189] of the Supreme Court Act 2003, that court may remit the proposed appeal to the Court of Appeal if the Supreme Court considers that a further appeal from the determination of the High Court is justified.
    
    (4) Any determination of the Court of Appeal under subclause (3) is final.
    
    (5) Despite any enactment to the contrary,---
        
    *   (a) an application for leave for the purposes of subclause (2) must be filed no later than 10 working days after the determination of the High Court; and

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Rugby World Cup 2011 (Empowering) Act 2010\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 31 October 2011, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][190] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][191] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][192] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][193] and [17E][194] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
