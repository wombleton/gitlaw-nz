*   This Act may be cited as the Reserves and Other Lands Disposal Act 1960\.

##### 2 Authorising issue of a special lease over portion of sounds foreshore reserve, Tory Channel
    
*   Whereas by a notice issued pursuant to [section 17][20] of the Reserves and Other Lands Disposal Act 1955 dated 12 February 1960, and published in the _Gazette_ of the 18th day of that month, that portion of Government road fronting Lot 3, DP 1519, described in subsection (4) (in this section referred to as the _said land_) was declared to be subject to the Reserves and Domains Act 1953 as a public reserve for sounds foreshore purposes: 
    
    And whereas situated partly on the said land and partly on adjoining foreshore is a whale factory owned by J. A. Perano & Co. Limited (in this section referred to as the _Company_) incorporated under the Companies Act 1955: 
    
    And whereas the Company occupies part of the said land and adjoining foreshore (together forming the site of the whale factory) under a licence issued to Joseph Henry Perano and Gilbert Thomas Perano under the provisions of the Whaling Industry Act 1935: 
    
    And whereas the balance of the said land has been held by the Company under temporary licence issued under the [Land Act 1948][21]: 
    
    And whereas the last-mentioned licence has expired and in the interests of its business the Company desires a long-term lease granting it exclusive occupation of the said land: 
    
    And whereas no authority exists for the granting of such a long-term lease: 
    
    And whereas the Company is prepared to allow the general public to have the right to use the track over the Company's land at the back of the said land so as to maintain continuity of access along the sounds foreshore reserves, and has agreed to maintain the track in good order: 
    
    And whereas the said land is not required for use for sounds foreshore purposes and it is desirable to grant the Company a long-term lease of the said land: 
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    (1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in [section 17][20] of the Reserves and Other Lands Disposal Act 1955 or in any other Act or rule of law, the Minister of Lands may grant a lease to the Company to exclusively occupy the said land or any portion thereof, for a term of 21 years, with or without a perpetual right of renewal, but with no right of acquiring the fee simple, at such rent and upon such other terms and conditions as the Minister thinks fit:
    
    provided that should at any time the said land so leased be no longer required or used for the purpose of a site for a whale factory, then the lease thereof shall immediately determine and the land revert to the Crown for use as a reserve for sounds foreshore purposes freed from all rights, title, and interest therein on the part of the Company.
    
    (2) Any lease, surrender, or other instrument that is required to be executed for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions contained in this section authorising the leasing of the said land may be executed by the Commissioner of Crown Lands for the Marlborough Land District, and any such instrument that is so executed shall not require to be executed by or on behalf of the Minister of Lands and shall be deemed to be validly executed for all purposes.

    And whereas the said land is no longer required as a municipal endowment and it is desirable that it should be declared Crown land subject to the [Land Act 1948][21]:

    And whereas most of them have never been used as roads and will not be required as roads in the future: 
    
    And whereas it is desirable and expedient that special provision be made to enable the land, together with such roads as are not required, to be vested in Her Majesty as Crown land:

    (3) Any roads or portions of roads (legal or otherwise), the subject of any Proclamation under subsection (2) shall, on the issue of the Proclamation, be deemed to be closed, as from the date specified in the Proclamation.

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Reserves and Other Lands Disposal Act 1960\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 3 October 1995, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][34] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][35] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][36] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][37] and [17E][38] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
