    And whereas it is desirable to make further provision in relation thereto in manner hereinafter appearing:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:

    (2) The provisions of sections 278, 279, and 280 of the Public Works Act 1928 and of [Part 3][35] of the Finance Act 1933 (No 2) shall, so far as they are applicable and with the necessary modifications, apply with respect to every agreement made (whether before or after the passing of this Act) under paragraph (d) of subsection (2) of the said [section 15][34], as if it were an irrigation agreement as defined in [section 34][36] of the said Finance Act 1933 (No 2).
    
    (3) In the application of the said provisions as provided by the last preceding subsection---

    (4) _Amendment(s) incorporated in the [Act(s)][37]._
    
    (5) In the next 2 succeeding subsections the term _lease_ means a lease or licence issued by or on behalf of His Majesty the King, and includes a licence to occupy land pending the purchase thereof from His Majesty on a system of deferred payments.
    
    (6) Where the lessee for the time being under any lease (whether issued before or after the passing of this Act) of any land in respect of which an irrigation agreement under the said paragraph (d) of subsection (2) of the said [section 15][34] is for the time being registered surrenders his lease and obtains a new lease in exchange therefor, the irrigation agreement and the provisions applied by subsection (2) hereof shall continue to apply with respect to the new lease as if it were a renewal of the surrendered lease. Where any such lessee obtains a title in fee simple to any land in respect of which an irrigation agreement is for the time being registered, the irrigation agreement and the provisions applied as aforesaid shall continue to apply with respect to that land as if the agreement had been made with the legal owner in fee simple of the land.
    
    (7) In every lease (whether issued before or after the passing of this Act) of any land in respect of which any such irrigation agreement is for the time being registered (whether registered before or after the execution of the lease) there shall be implied a covenant by the lessee with His Majesty the King to observe and perform the irrigation agreement and to pay all moneys from time to time payable thereunder in respect of the land comprised in the lease.
    
    (8) The power of delegation conferred on the Minister by paragraph (e) of subsection (2) of the said [section 15][34] may be exercised from time to time. Every such delegation shall be revocable at will, and no such delegation shall prevent the exercise of any power by the Minister in person.
    
    (9) Any such delegation may be made to a committee comprising such of the persons for the time being entitled to a supply of water under the said section as may be specified in that behalf in the instrument of delegation. The Minister may from time to time appoint any person for the time being entitled to a supply of water as aforesaid to be a member of any such committee.

    And whereas the diagram and the description in the said grant included only 67 acres 1 rood, being part only of the said Allotment 94A:
    
    And whereas portion of the said Allotment, omitted from the diagram and description in the said grant, was subsequently offered for selection and selected under an occupation with right of purchase license and the freehold thereof was acquired:
    
    And whereas it would be inequitable to disturb the said freehold title:

    And whereas by the inclusion of an area of adjoining unoccupied Crown land the necessary area may be made up:

*   This is a reprint of the Reserves and other Lands Disposal Act 1936\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 April 1973, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][46] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][47] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][48] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][49] and [17E][50] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   â¢omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   â¢typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   â¢layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   â¢indentation
        *   â¢position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   â¢format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   â¢format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   â¢position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   â¢punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   â¢Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   â¢case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   â¢format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   â¢small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   â¢schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   â¢running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
