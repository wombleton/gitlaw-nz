##### 1 Short Title
    
*   This Act may be cited as the Reserves and Other Lands Disposal Act 1949\.

##### 2 Adjusting the boundary between portion of the Waikato--Thames Railway and certain freehold land, and validating certain certificates of title
    
*   Whereas by a Proclamation dated 17 December 1881 and registered in the Land Registry Office at Auckland as Number 607 (in this section referred to as the _Proclamation_), certain land in the City of Hamilton was taken for the purpose of the Waikato--Thames Railway:
    
    And whereas in January 1904 certain adjoining land was subdivided, and the subdivisional plan thereof deposited in the said Land Registry Office as Number 3198:
    
    And whereas the various lots on the said plan have been sold and certificates of title over them have been issued to various purchasers in accordance with the plan:
    
    And whereas it has subsequently been discovered that the common boundary between the land included in the Proclamation and that shown on the plan is not correct and that certain land shown on the plan as freehold land is also included in the Proclamation as railway land and certain freehold land not included in the plan but shown as adjoining railway land was not included in the Proclamation and is not in fact railway land:
    
    And whereas to rectify the position it is desirable and expedient to amend the boundary of the land taken by the Proclamation so that the said boundary coincides with the boundary of the land included in the plan:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    (1) The south-eastern boundary of the land taken by the Proclamation, commencing from the point of intersection of the said boundary with River Road in the City of Hamilton and continuing in a north-easterly direction to its point of intersection with Heaphy Terrace in the same city, shall be deemed to be and to have always been that shown as the north-western boundary on the said plan as redefined by later surveys and shown on plans deposited in the Land Registry Office at Auckland under Numbers 3978, 7000, 13040, 14251, and 28995\.
    
    (2) The certificates of title issued in accordance with the said plan are hereby validated and declared to have been properly issued.

##### 3 Validating a certain payment made by the Moana Domain Board
    
*   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Local Authorities (Members' Contracts) Act 1934 or in any other Act, the payment of 65 pounds made during the financial year ending on 31 March 1950 by the Moana Domain Board to William Williams, of Moana, in respect of a contract carried out by him while a member of the Board is hereby validated and declared to have been lawfully made by the Board and to have been lawfully received by the said William Williams, who shall not be deemed to have been disqualified for continuing to hold office as a member of the Board by reason of his being concerned or interested in the contract in respect of which the said sum of 65 pounds was paid, nor shall he be deemed to have committed any offence by reason of having done any act as a member of the Board while concerned or interested in the said contract.

    And whereas the funds derived from the leasing of the reserve vested in the trustees have been expended by them upon the library erected on the land owned by the Ngaruawahia Borough Council:

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Reserves and Other Lands Disposal Act 1949\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 July 2003, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][58] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][59] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][60] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][61] and [17E][62] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
