An Act to empower the Riverton Borough Council to apply for the purpose of assisting in urgent works of the Corporation---namely, water supply, drainage, and fire protection---moneys arising from real and personal property of the Mayor, Councillors, and Burgesses of the Borough of Riverton vested in that body by the Riverton Corporation Empowering Act 1889
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    Whereas by the provisions of the [Riverton Corporation Empowering Act 1889][7] the Riverton Harbour Board was dissolved and its real and personal property was vested in the Mayor, Councillors, and Burgesses of the Borough of Riverton upon the same trusts and for the same purposes for which the said Harbour Board held the same:
    
    And whereas the moneys and rents arising from the said property now amount to over 3,000 pounds:
    
    And whereas the said moneys now held by the said Council can not at present be used for the purposes on which the said property was so vested in the Corporation of the said Borough.

##### 1 Short Title
    
*   This Act may be cited as the Riverton Borough Empowering Act 1947\.

##### 2 Interpretation
    
*   _Corporation_ means the Mayor, Councillors, and Burgesses of the Borough of Riverton
    
    _Council_ means the Riverton Borough Council.

##### 3 Use by Council of accumulated income from harbour property
    
*   (1) For the purposes of providing water supply, drainage, and fire protection for its borough, and for meeting the annual charges of any special loans hereafter raised by the Council for any of the said purposes, the Council is hereby empowered to divert and use all moneys accrued at 31 March 1948 from the real and personal property vested in the Corporation under the [Riverton Corporation Empowering Act 1889][7].
    
    (2) The Council shall, before diverting and using any of the said moneys, make provision for the repayment thereof by establishing a sinking fund under the Local Bodies' Loans Act 1926, and shall in the month of April in each year thereafter, until the accumulated sinking fund is sufficient to repay the said moneys, pay to the Commissioners of the sinking fund an amount calculated at the rate of 1 pound per centum of the amount of the said moneys. For the purposes of this subsection the provisions of sections 39 to 44 of the Local Bodies' Loans Act 1926 shall, so far as applicable and with the necessary modifications, apply in all respects as if the sinking fund under this section were a sinking fund established for the purposes of a special loan under that Act.

##### 4 Use by Council of annual income from harbour property
    
*   (1) The Council may divert and use for all or any of the purposes referred to in the last preceding section all surplus moneys accruing from the said real and personal property in each year after the year ending 31 March 1948, being moneys remaining after due provision has been made for payment of all costs, charges, and expenses incurred or payable by the Council for harbour purposes.
    
    (2) The Council shall, before diverting and using under this section the surplus moneys accrued in any year, make provision for the repayment thereof by establishing a sinking fund on the same terms and conditions and subject to the same provisions as if it were a sinking fund established under the last preceding section.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Riverton Borough Empowering Act 1947\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 19 November 1947, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][8] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][9] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][10] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][11] and [17E][12] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
