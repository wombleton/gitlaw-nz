    And whereas the Board desires to transfer the land to Her Majesty the Queen by way of gift for a flora and fauna reserve subject to the conditions specified in subsection (1):
    
    And whereas on 19 October 1971, pursuant to the said section 438, the court made a further order that the Board as trustees transfer the land by way of gift to Her Majesty on the conditions referred to:
    
    And whereas Her Majesty is willing to accept the gift on those conditions:
    
    And whereas it is desired to vest the land in Her Majesty on those conditions:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    (1) The conditions referred to in this section are that Her Majesty the Queen undertakes---
        
    *   (a) to protect the land described in subsection (4) by declaring it to be and administering it as a reserve:
    
    *   (b) to obtain the consent of the Board before changing the purpose of the reserve:
    
    *   (c) to return the land without delay to the Board should it be no longer required as a reserve.
    
    (2) Notwithstanding Part 21 of the Maori Affairs Act 1953, or any other enactment, the land described in subsection (4) is hereby vested in Her Majesty the Queen for the purposes of a reserve for the preservation of flora and fauna on the land, subject to the Reserves and Domains Act 1953 and to the conditions specified in subsection (1).

    And whereas subsection (3) of that section directs that the proceeds of sale of any such land shall be applied towards the objects specified in that subsection:
    
    And whereas it is desired to specify further objects towards which the proceeds of any such sale shall be applied:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Reserves and Other Lands Disposal Act 1972\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 19 July 1990, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][12] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][13] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][14] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][15] and [17E][16] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
