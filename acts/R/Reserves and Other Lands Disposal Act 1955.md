    And whereas the Council has not struck the rates in respect of the said loans as provided by the said [section 31][41], but the redemption payments in respect of those loans have been paid from its General Account and it is desirable to authorize reimbursement of the money so paid and to validate the actions of the Council as aforesaid:
    
    And whereas it has been found impracticable and uneconomic to proceed with the said works:

    *   (b) Reserve 3185 shall be held upon trust for the purposes of enabling the Corporation to erect drainage works by which the annually recurring losses and injury caused by the flood waters of Lake Forsyth may be prevented.
    
    (5) The Council may, until the maturity of the investments representing the said loan moneys, continue to pay the redemption payments on the said loans from its General Account and shall, upon the maturity of any such investments, reimburse to its General Account such amount as may then have been paid therefrom in redemption of the said loans, and the amount so reimbursed may be used for such purposes in the County of Wairewa as the Council shall deem fit. The Council shall apply the balance of the said loan moneys towards future redemption payments on the said loans and may continue to invest and reinvest such balance as may from time to time be held by the Council in such investments as shall for the time being be authorized by law for the investment of trust funds and, if on maturity of the said loans, there are insufficient funds to complete repayment of the said loans, the Council is hereby authorized to make good any such deficiency by a payment from its General Account.
    
    (6) The Lake Forsyth Endowment Account, representing rents collected by or owing to the Council in respect of its endowment Reserves 3586 and 3185, is hereby declared to be closed and the Council shall establish a separate account for each of the said Reserves 3586 and 3185 and pay thereto all money now held or hereafter received in respect of the said reserves.
    
    (7) The money in the said accounts shall be expended as required for the proper fulfilment of the objects of the trusts of the reserve to which each account is related and the Council may from time to time, and until such time as the money in the separate accounts shall be required for the purposes aforesaid, invest and reinvest the money in each separate account in such investments as shall for the time being be authorized by law for the investment of trust funds and all income received from any such investments shall be accumulated and added to the money in each of such separate accounts and the Council shall have the power to make such charges against such separate accounts for reasonable expenses incurred in the administration of the trusts relating to each of the said reserves as shall be approved by the Controller and Auditor-General.

*   Whereas, pursuant to the authority of the New River Harbour Board Ordinance 1874 and subsequent enactments, the land firstly, secondly, and thirdly described in the Schedule of this Act was vested in the Mayor, Councillors, and Citizens of the City of Invercargill (in this section referred to as the **Corporation**) upon trust as an endowment for the New River Harbour: 
    
    And whereas for many years the Corporation has been the Harbour Board for the New River Harbour and has expended substantial sums of money on the development and reclamation for farming and commercial purposes of certain portions of the said land:
    
    And whereas portions of the said land are leased by the Corporation to the Crown and to various other persons:
    
    And whereas the revenue from the said land credited to the Harbour Fund has for many years now been insufficient to meet the cost of this reclamation and development work and the General Account of the Corporation has been drawn upon to meet the deficiency:
    
    And whereas this endowment land has been used and developed more for municipal purposes than for harbour purposes:
    
    And whereas the harbour has not been used for commercial shipping for over 20 years and it would be impracticable and uneconomic to develop it as a commercial harbour and a Harbour Board is no longer required to control it:
    
    And whereas it is desirable that the Harbour Board for the New River Harbour be abolished and that the status of the land firstly and thirdly described in the Schedule be altered and the land be revested in the Corporation as an endowment for municipal purposes and also that all assets and liabilities of the said Board be vested in the Corporation:
    
    And whereas, to ensure the safe pilotage of any small vessels over the harbour bar, it is also desirable that a harbourmaster be retained for this purpose:
    
    And whereas the site of the Invercargill Aerodrome is situated on portion of the said land and it is further desired that the status over the land secondly described in the Schedule be altered and the land be revested in the Corporation as a reserve for aerodrome purposes:

    (2) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the New River Harbour Board Ordinance 1874 or in any other Act or rule of law, the vesting of the land firstly, secondly, and thirdly described in the Schedule in the Corporation is hereby revoked:
    
    provided that nothing in this section shall be deemed to affect the validity of any dealing with any part of the said land in accordance with the terms under which it was held prior to the commencement of this Act.
    
    (3) The land firstly and thirdly described in the Schedule is hereby declared to be vested in the Corporation upon trust as an endowment for municipal purposes subject to the provisions of the Municipal Corporations Act 1954 and subject also to all leases, liens, encumbrances, easements, and other restrictions affecting the land:
    
    provided that the provisions of sections 147 and 148 of the Harbours Act 1950 shall continue to apply in respect of the said land.

    (5) All leases over any portion of the land firstly and thirdly described in the Schedule subsisting on the coming into force of this section shall be deemed to be made between the Corporation and the lessee named in the instrument of lease and shall continue in full force and effect according to their tenor.

    *   (a) the New River Harbour Board Land Act 1875:
    
    *   (b) the New River Harbour Endowment and Borrowing Act 1878:

*   Whereas by [section 79][45] of the Local Legislation Act 1927 special provisions were made in respect of the Orakei Garden Suburb more particularly described in subsection (11) of that section:
    
    And whereas the said [section 79][45] provided that, on the publication in the _Gazette_ of a notice by the Minister of Lands that 50% of the saleable land in the said Orakei Garden Suburb had been sold by the Crown and possession thereof given to purchasers, the Auckland City Council (in this section referred to as the **Council**) was required to pay to the Crown the sum of 200,000 pounds on the terms specified in the said section:
    
    And whereas it was further provided that, until the publication of such notice as aforesaid, special rates could not be charged by the Council in respect of the said Orakei Garden Suburb:

    And whereas, because of the general development of the locality, it has been agreed between the Council and the Crown that the said sum of 200,000 pounds shall be deemed to have been lent to the Council and the Council shall be deemed to have lawfully borrowed the same from the Crown on 31 March 1956, and that the Council may from that date charge special rates in respect of the Orakei Garden Suburb land:

    provided that, until such time as the Minister of Lands publishes a notice in the _Gazette_ in terms of subsection (3) of the said section 79, the Council, instead of the said annual instalment, shall pay to the Crown an amount equivalent to the amount of the special rates payable in each year in respect of land in the Orakei Garden Suburb:

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Reserves and Other Lands Disposal Act 1955\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 8 September 1999, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][49] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][50] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][51] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][52] and [17E][53] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
