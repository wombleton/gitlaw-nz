##### 1 Title
    
*   This Act is the Unit Titles Act 2010\.

##### 2 Commencement
    
*   This Act comes into force on a date to be appointed by the Governor-General by Order in Council.
    
    Section 2: this Act brought into force, on 20 June 2011, by the [Unit Titles Act 2010 Commencement Order 2011][292] (SR 2011/121).

## Part 1  
Preliminary provisions

##### 3 Purpose
    
*   The purpose of this Act is to provide a legal framework for the ownership and management of land and associated buildings and facilities on a socially and economically sustainable basis by communities of individual owners and, in particular,---
        
    *   (a) to allow for the subdivision of land and buildings into unit title developments comprising units that are owned in stratum estate in freehold or stratum estate in leasehold or licence by unit owners, and common property that is owned by the body corporate on behalf of the unit owners; and
    
    *   (b) to create bodies corporate, which comprise all unit owners in a development, to operate and manage unit title developments; and
    
    *   (c) to establish a flexible and responsive regime for the governance of unit title developments; and
    
    *   (d) to protect the integrity of the development as a whole.
    
    

##### 4 Overview
    
*   (1) This Act provides for the following matters:
        
    *   ###### Preliminary provisions
    
    *   (a) [Part 1][3] sets out the purpose of the Act and its application, and defines terms used in the Act:
    
    *   ###### Creation of unit title developments
    
    *   (b) [subparts 1 to 6][18] of Part 2 deal with the creation of unit title developments and related matters, in particular---
            
        *   (i) land and buildings may be subdivided into a unit title development by the deposit of a unit plan by the Registrar-General of Land:
        
        *   (ii) a unit title development consists of separate units and common property (the common property being the remainder of the land (or building) that is for the use of all the unit owners):
        
        *   (iii) units are either principal units or accessory units:
        
        *   (iv) principal units may be places of residence or business (for example, shops) or for other uses:
        
        *   (v) accessory units are designed for use with a principal unit (for example, a garage or car parking space):
        
        *   (vi) the legal title that is created in the units is a different estate from the legal title to the underlying land on which the development is built:
        
        *   (vii) the bundle of legal rights applying to the unit is called a stratum estate:
        
        *   (viii) a principal unit in a unit title development (for example, a building or part of a building) and its accessory unit may be further subdivided to create another unit title development (this creates a layered unit title development (_see_ [section 20][25] and the illustrations in examples 2 and 3 in [Schedule 1][289])):
        
        *   (ix) each unit is assigned an ownership interest and a utility interest and that is relevant to the calculation of many of the unit owner's rights under the Act:
        
        *   (x) a unit title development may be created in stages, with successive plans deposited by the Registrar-General of Land as the development progresses:
        
        
    
    *   ###### Dealings with unit title developments
    
    *   (c) [subparts 7 to 11][60] of Part 2 concern dealings with various parts of the unit title development, in particular---
            
        *   (i) principal units in a unit title development may be bought and sold individually:
        
        *   (ii) accessory units are bought and sold with the principal units to which they relate (although they may be transferred between principal unit owners of the unit title development):
        
        *   (iii) the common property is owned by the body corporate that administers the unit title development, and the unit owners have a beneficial interest:
        
        *   (iv) the body corporate has the ability to deal with the common property in various ways, for example, selling or leasing it or creating easements and covenants affecting it:
        
        *   (v) a unit owner has certain abilities to create easements and covenants relating to that unit:

    (2) If any person, having lodged a caveat pursuant to [section 195][244], consents to the new unit plan, and the caveat is still in force at the time, the consent to the plan has the effect of removing the caveat, and the Registrar must mark the Registrar's records accordingly.
    
    (3) No unit plan may be deposited unless every member of the company or the owner, or the owner's agent duly authorised in writing, and every person having security over any unit shown on the plan under any mortgage or charge to which [section 198(2)][247] relates consents to the deposit, but the Registrar may dispense with the consent if the Registrar---
        
    *   (a) is satisfied that it would not be reasonable in any particular circumstances to insist on the consent to the deposit of the plan; and
    
    *   (b) has no reason to believe that the plan does not correctly define the unit of that member or owner.
    
    (4) If any person whose consent is required to the deposit of the new unit plan is dead or cannot be found or refuses to consent or does not consent within a reasonable time or if for any reason it is impracticable to obtain the consent of that person, the High Court, on the application of any applicant under this subpart, may if it thinks fit consent on behalf of that person to the deposit of the plan.

##### 198 Mortgages and charges to be discharged before deposit of unit plan
    
*   (1) No unit plan may be deposited under this subpart while the land to which it relates or any part of that land is subject to any mortgage or charge unless the mortgage or charge relates to no land shown on the plan other than a proposed unit or units in respect of which (under [section 43(2)][53]) the Registrar has been requested at the time when the plan is deposited to create a separate computer register.
    
    (2) If a unit plan is deposited in accordance with subsection (1) while there is a mortgage or charge over the unit or units for which (under [section 43(2)][53]) the Registrar is requested to create a separate computer register, the deposit of the plan and the creation of the computer register does not affect the mortgage or charge; and if, on the creation of the separate computer register, the stratum estate in the unit or units is subject to the mortgage or charge, then the mortgage or charge must be notified on the computer register in a manner so as to preserve its priority.
    
    Compare: 1972 No 15 [s 63][378]

##### 199 Effect of deposit of unit plan
    
*   (1) On the deposit of a unit plan under this subpart, the stratum estate in each unit vests in the person who, immediately before the plan was deposited, was the holder of shares in the company entitling him or her to the exclusive occupation of that unit, or the lessee under a lease of that unit from the owners to himself or herself. The stratum estate may then devolve or be transferred, leased, mortgaged, settled, or otherwise dealt with as provided in this Act.
    
    (2) On the deposit by a company of a unit plan, the company, if it is a company within the meaning of [section 2][379] of the Companies Act 1993, is deemed to have been removed from the New Zealand register and that Act ceases to apply to it.
    
    (3) On the deposit, whether by a company or by the owners, of a unit plan in accordance with this subpart,---
        
    *   (a) every certificate relating to shares in the company, and every copy of every registered or unregistered lease or licence granted by the company to one of its members or granted by the owners to one of them, is of no further effect:
    
    *   (b) except as otherwise provided in this section, all property, rights, powers, claims, and remedies belonging to the company, or to the owners as registered proprietors of the base land, immediately before the deposit of the plan, vests in the proprietors in accordance with this Act:
    
    *   (c) all existing liabilities of the company (except liability to its members in respect of share capital), or of the proprietors as registered proprietors of the base land, whether certain or contingent, must be transferred to and be borne by the body corporate:
    
    *   (d) except so far as they are altered or modified expressly or by necessary implication by reason of the deposit of the unit plan under this Act, the rights, interests, duties, obligations, and liabilities of the members of the company existing in relation to the company immediately before its dissolution continue in existence in relation to the body corporate and must not be otherwise affected or abated by the dissolution:
    
    *   (e) all acts, matters, and things of a continuing nature made, done, or commenced by or on behalf of the company and immediately before its dissolution of any force or effect or capable of acquiring any force or effect are deemed to have been done or commenced by or on behalf of the body corporate:
    
    *   (f) any reference to the company in any document or instrument must, if not inconsistent with the context or subject-matter, be read as a reference to the body corporate.
    
    (4) Nothing in subsection (3)(c) affects a mortgage or charge to which [section 198(2)][247] relates.

##### 200 Creation of computer register in respect of units
    
*   (1) On the deposit of the unit plan, the Registrar must---
        
    *   (a) cancel the computer register to the base land; and
    
    *   (b) create a computer register for the stratum estate to which the person who will be the owner of each principal unit is entitled in that unit and any accessory unit.
    
    (2) Every computer register created under subsection (1) is deemed to be a computer register created under the [Land Transfer Act 1952][295] and, subject to the provisions of this Act, the provisions of that Act apply accordingly.
    
    (3) If the computer register created under subsection (1) relates to a unit in respect of which there was, before the plan was deposited, a registered lease or licence, the provisions of [section 117(2) to (4)][381] of the Land Transfer Act 1952 apply to the computer register for that unit as if it were a lease in substitution for a previously registered lease.
    
    (4) The provisions of [section 7(2) and (3)][382] of the Joint Family Homes Act 1964 apply in every case where a computer register is created under subsection (1) in respect of a unit that was settled as a joint family home immediately before the deposit of the new unit plan relating to that unit.

*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][426] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][427] and [17E][428] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
