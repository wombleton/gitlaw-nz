    (3) When carrying out work in a transport corridor, utility operators must comply with the Code---
        
    *   (a) except to the extent that any particular provision of the Code is inconsistent with an enactment, or any standard or other instrument that the utility operator is obliged to comply with; or

*   A person who, knowing that the person is subject to an order made under [section 7][8], fails to comply with the order, or fails to comply with the order within the time specified in the order, commits an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $200,000\.
    
    Section 8: amended, on 1 July 2013, by [section 413][37] of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011 (2011 No 81).

#### Nature of Code

##### 9 Purpose of Code
    
*   The purpose of the Code is to enable access by utility operators to transport corridors to be managed in a way that---
        
    *   (a) maximises the benefit to the public while ensuring that all utility operators are treated fairly; and
    
    *   (b) ensures that disruptions to roads, motorways, and railways caused by work by utility operators are kept to a minimum, while maintaining safety; and
    
    *   (c) provides a nationally consistent approach to managing access to transport corridors.
    
    

##### 10 Content of Code
    
*   (1) In order to achieve its purpose, the Code must set out the following:
        
    *   (a) who it applies to:
    
    *   (b) the principles governing how corridor managers deal with utility operators, and how utility operators deal with corridor managers and other utility operators, on issues relating to access to transport corridors:
    
    *   (c) the processes and rules for co-ordinating work done in transport corridors by utility operators, or that affects utility operators' assets:
    
    *   (d) processes for dealing with conflicts of interest arising from the same person being both a corridor manager and a utility operator, or being the operator of different utilities:
    
    *   (e) how the statutory criteria for setting reasonable conditions, when utility operators have a right of access, are to be applied:
    
    *   (f) whether, what, and how any other conditions relating to access may be imposed by corridor managers when utility operators have a right of access:
    
    *   (g) how the criteria (published in accordance with a statutory requirement) for granting access are to be applied when utility operators request access:
    
    *   (h) processes and rules for utility operators and corridor managers to share information:
    
    *   (i) how compliance with the provisions of the Code is to be encouraged and provided for, including 1 or more dispute resolution procedures:
    
    *   (j) operational processes and rules about work done by utility operators within transport corridors:
    
    *   (k) if the Code refers to standards, guidelines, or other documents that are not set out in the Code,---
            
        *   (i) how those standards, guidelines, or other documents (including any amendments and replacements) may be viewed and how copies may be obtained; and
        
        *   (ii) which edition or version of the standard, guidelines, or other document is referred to and whether the reference includes subsequent amendments or replacements.
        
        
    
    (2) The Code may also---
        
    *   (a) provide for its provisions to be applied differently in different geographic locations, provided the variations comply with subsection (3); and
    
    *   (b) include any other matter that is consistent with the purpose of the Code and not inconsistent with any enactment.
    
    (3) Variations referred to in subsection (2)(a) may be allowed by the Code only if the variations---
        
    *   (a) are generally consistent with paragraphs (a) and (b) of the purpose of the Code set out in [section 9][11]; and
    
    *   (b) are in response to particular geographic factors that would result in inefficient or uneconomic outcomes if the standard requirements of the Code were adopted; and
    
    *   (c) have been sought and agreed to by the corridor managers and utility operators in that region; and
    
    *   (d) fairly balance the interests of corridor managers and utility operators. 
    
    

#### How Code made and administered

##### 11 Preparation of Code
    
*   (1) A draft Code may be prepared by the Ministry, or by any person or body of persons, using whatever processes the Ministry, person, or body considers appropriate.
    
    (2) The process for developing a draft Code must include, at a minimum, the following steps:
        
    *   (a) consultation with utility operators and corridor managers likely to be affected by the Code:
    
    *   (b) publication of a draft Code and release to the public:
    
    *   (c) consideration of comment received on the draft Code:
    
    *   (d) preparation of a revised draft Code in response to comments received.
    
    (3) A draft Code may be submitted to the Minister for approval at any time after the steps referred to in subsection (2) have been taken.
    
    (4) Any consultation done before this Act comes into force does not count as consultation for the purposes of subsection (2).

##### 12 Approval of Code
    
*   (1) Within 3 months after receiving a draft Code, the Minister must either approve or reject it.
    
    (2) The Minister may approve a draft Code only if---
        
    *   (a) he or she has consulted with the related Ministers; and
    
    *   (b) he or she is satisfied that the draft Code---
            
        *   (i) is capable of achieving the purpose set out in [section 9][11]; and
        
        *   (ii) adequately sets out the matters referred to in [section 10(1)][12]; and
        
        *   (iii) has been developed by a process that includes the steps set out in [section 11(2)][14]; and
        
        *   (iv) is broadly agreed to by the corridor managers and utility operators likely to be affected by the draft Code; and
        
        *   (v) reflects a balance between the interests of corridor managers and those of utility operators.
        
        
    
    (3) The Minister's decision under this section must be given in writing to whoever submitted the draft Code to the Minister for approval. 
    
    (4) If the Minister approves a Code, he or she must give notice in the _Gazette_ of that fact, and the notice must state---
        
    *   (a) the date on which the Code takes effect in accordance with [section 13(1)][16]; and
    
    *   (b) the Internet site on which the Code is available and where it is or will be available for purchase, at no more than a reasonable cost, in hard copy.
    
    

##### 13 When Code takes effect
    
*   (1) The Code takes effect on the date specified in the _Gazette_ notice referred to in [section 12(4)(a)][15], which must be a date after the date of the _Gazette_ notice and on or after the date on which the Code is first published under [section 14(1)(a)][17].
    
    (2) The Code ceases to have effect on the date specified by the Minister in a notice of cancellation made under [section 17][20].
    
    (3) It is not intended that any processes, notices, conditions, or other matters that were previously settled should be affected by the Code taking effect or by any subsequent cancellation or amendment of the Code.

    (2) The Minister may, instead of or as well as publishing amendments separately from the Code, publish the Code with amendments incorporated; but in that case the Code published on the Internet site must indicate what changes have been made and when.

##### 15 Status of Code
    
*   (1) A Code approved under [section 12][15] is a disallowable instrument, but not a legislative instrument, for the purposes of the [Legislation Act 2012][38].
    
    (2) The Code must be presented to the House of Representatives no later than 16 days after the date on which it is made.

##### 16 Amendment of Code
    
*   (1) The Minister may at any time approve an amendment to the Code.

    *   (a) [section 12(2)][15] does not apply; and
    
    *   (b) the proposed amendment need not---
            
        *   (i) include the matters referred to in subsection (3)(c) and (d); or
        
        *   (ii) comply with [section 11(2)(b) to (d)][14].

*   (1) The Minister may cancel the Code if he or she is satisfied that---
        
    *   (a) the Code no longer adequately reflects a balance between the interests of corridor managers and those of utility operators; or
    
    *   (b) the Code is not achieving its purpose; or

#### Regulations in place of Code

##### 18 Power to make regulations if no Code
    
*   (1) The Governor-General may, on the recommendation of the Minister given in accordance with subsection (2), make regulations regulating how access by utility operators to transport corridors is managed.
    
    (2) The Minister may not recommend making regulations under this section unless he or she is satisfied that---
        
    *   (a) either---
            
        *   (i) no Code has taken effect and no Code is likely to take effect; or
        
        *   (ii) an existing Code is or is likely to be cancelled; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) the regulations set out a code that has the purpose set out in [section 9][11] and includes the matters set out in [section 10(1)][12]; and
    
    *   (c) the regulations are likely to improve the efficiency of utility operators' access to transport corridors, without compromising road or rail safety; and
    
    *   (d) the regulations reflect, as far as possible, any agreements reached by utility operators and corridor managers; and
    
    *   (e) the related Ministers have been consulted and concur in the desirability of making the regulations and the content of the regulations.
    
    (3) Regulations made under this section may incorporate by reference any written material that prescribes, defines, or makes other provision for goods, services, processes, or practices that are relevant to the regulations.
    
    (4) If material is incorporated by reference in regulations made under this section, the [Schedule][23] applies to that material, unless the material is a New Zealand Standard (as defined in [section 2][40] of the Standards Act 1988), in which case that Act applies.
