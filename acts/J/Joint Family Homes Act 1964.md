        provided that no such direction shall be given without the consent of the owner or owners of the settled property if the effect of the cancellation will be to reduce to the specified sum or less the net value of the property which remains settled as that value is determined under [section 20][22]:
    
    *   (b) direct a mortgage or sale of the whole of the settled property and a distribution of the money borrowed or of the proceeds of sale in accordance with [section 17][19]:
        
        provided that, unless the owner or owners consent to a greater sum being borrowed, the greatest sum which may be so borrowed shall be the amount of the specified sum less than the said net value of the settled property or the amount determined under subsection (3), whichever amount is the greater.

        provided that, where the High Court, having regard to the nature of the security and all other relevant circumstances, is satisfied that the terms of any mortgage, charge, or encumbrance so repaid are unusual in that they give rise to a reasonable inference that they have been arranged to defeat, or to attempt to defeat, the rights of any creditor or creditors, the court may accept an application made under subsection (1).
    
    (3) The amount which, by paragraph (b) of subsection (1), is required to be determined under this subsection shall be equal to the total of---

            provided that all sums so repaid or provided shall be taken into account if, by reason of the proviso to subsection (2)(c), the High Court accepts an application made under subsection (1) and directs a mortgage or sale of the settled property; and
        
        *   (ii) expended or provided in acquiring any additional, new, substituted, or different estate or interest in the settled property.

*   (1) For the purposes of [section 16][18] the net value of any settled property shall be the amount of the capital value within the meaning of the [Rating Valuations Act 1998][65] of the land included in the settlement, plus the amount of the value which any relative shares may have independent of the land with which they are settled, less the amount by which the High Court considers that value is reduced by reason of mortgages, charges, liens, and encumbrances over the settled property or any part thereof. For the purposes of this subsection the said value of any such shares shall be assessed by a competent valuer acceptable to all the persons concerned, or (failing their agreement) appointed by the court; and mortgages, charges, liens, and encumbrances in respect of the shares shall not be taken into account in fixing the value thereof for the purposes of this subsection:
    
    provided that, instead of requiring the court to appoint a valuer, the persons concerned may agree to the said value being assessed under the provisions of the Arbitration Act 1908\.
    
    (2) On the application of the owner or owners of any settled property or of any person entitled to make an application to the court under [section 16][18] in respect of any such property, and on payment of such fee as may be required by the registered valuer concerned, it is the duty of the President of the New Zealand Institute of Valuers to nominate a registered valuer to make a valuation of the settled land or any part of it at such date as the applicant or applicants may specify, and to give to the applicant or applicants a certificate setting forth the date at which the valuation is made, the area and description of the land to which the certificate relates, and the capital value of the land within the meaning of the [Rating Valuations Act 1998][65]. Where the applicant for the certificate is not an owner of the land, the registered valuer, when giving the certificate to the applicant, is to give a like certificate to the owner or owners of the land.
    
    (3) In any case where it is necessary for a valuation of any land to be made by a valuer in connection with a valuation of shares that is being made in accordance with subsection (1), the valuation of the land is to be made by a registered valuer nominated by the President of the New Zealand Institute of Valuers for the purpose. Where application for the valuation of any such land is made to the New Zealand Institute of Valuers by the valuer of any such shares, and payment is made to the registered valuer of an appropriate fee, and the registered valuer is supplied with such information as he or she may require, it is the duty of the registered valuer to make a valuation of the land at such date as the applicant may specify, and to give a certificate setting forth the date as at which the valuation is made, the area and description of the land to which the certificate relates, and the capital value of the land within the meaning of the [Rating Valuations Act 1998][65], to---
        
    *   (a) the applicant for the certificate; and
    
    *   (b) the owner or owners of the shares; and
    
    *   (c) every person at whose request the valuation of the shares is being made.
    
    (4) Where a registered valuer is required to give a certificate to any person under the foregoing provisions of this section, he may do so by sending it by post in a registered letter addressed in the case of the owner or owners of the joint family home to the said owner or owners at the joint family home, and in the case of any other person to that person at such address as may be specified by the applicant for the valuation. Where any such certificate is sent by post as aforesaid it shall be deemed to have been received by the owner or owners of the land at the time at which the letter would have been delivered in the ordinary course of post.
    
    (5) Any person to whom any such certificate is given pursuant to the provisions of this section may object to the valuation, by notice in writing delivered to the registered valuer within 1 month after that person receives or is deemed to receive that certificate.
    
    (5A) Any such objection is to be heard and determined as if it were an objection under [Part 4][66] of the Rating Valuations Act 1998, and [sections 34][67], [35][68], [36][69], and [38][70] of that Act (and any regulations made under that Act relating to reviews and objections), as far as they are applicable and with all necessary modifications, are to apply to the objection as if---
        
    *   (a) the registered valuer had been appointed by a territorial authority to review the objection; and
    
    *   (b) the review had been made under [section 34][67] of that Act; and
    
    *   (c) the references to a territorial authority in [sections 34(4)][67], [35][68], and [36][69] of that Act were references to the registered valuer.
    
    (5B) Where a valuation is varied as a result of any such objection the registered valuer must give an amended certificate to each person to whom he or she gave the original certificate.
    
    (6) Unless it is shown that the valuation to which any such certificate refers has been varied as a result of any objection as aforesaid, the certificate shall for the purposes of [section 16][18] be conclusive evidence of the matters therein set forth as aforesaid.
