*   And whereas by the provisions of the hereinbefore secondly-recited Act it was enacted, that the said Judicial Committee should have and enjoy in all respects such and the same power of punishing contempts and of compelling appearances, and that His Majesty in Council should have and enjoy in all respects such and the same powers of enforcing judgments, decrees, and orders, (both _in personam_ and _in rem_,) as are given to any Court Ecclesiastical by an Act of Parliament passed in a Session of Parliament of the Second and Third Years of the Reign of His Majesty King William the Fourth, intituled an Act for enforcing the Process upon Contempts in the Courts Ecclesiastical of England and Ireland, and that all such powers as are given to Courts Ecclesiastical, if of punishing contempts, or of compelling appearances, should be exercised by the said Judicial Committee, and of enforcing decrees and orders should be exercised by His Majesty in Council, in such and the same manner as the powers in and by such Act of Parliament given, and should be of as much force and effect as if the same had been thereby expressly given to the said Committee or to His Majesty in Council; be it enacted, that so much of the said Act as relates to the Powers thereby given to the said Judicial Committee and to His Majesty in Council, under the last-recited Act, shall be repealed.
