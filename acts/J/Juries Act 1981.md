    *   (b) promptly delete the person's details from the panel that was---
            
        *   (i) compiled under [section 13(1)][17]; and
        
        *   (ii) the basis of the issue of that summons; and
        
        
    
    *   (c) if a later panel is compiled under [section 13(1)][17] because jury trials are to be held in the court and that later panel is so compiled at a time that enables the person to be summoned for jury service at a time within the period specified for the person under [section 14B(1)(b)][22], ensure the person's details are included, in accordance with the jury rules, in that later panel and promptly issue under section 13(1), and on the basis of that later panel, a replacement summons that states a time within that period; and
    
    *   (d) if satisfied that no jury trials are to be held in the court during the period specified for the person under [section 14B(1)(b)][22] and therefore that it is unnecessary to compile under [section 13(1)][17] a later panel at a time that would enable the person to be summoned to attend for jury service at a time within that period, promptly serve on the person, in accordance with the jury rules, written notice that the person is no longer liable to serve as a juror as a result of the summons in relation to which the application under section 14B was made.
    
    (2) If the Registrar declines an application under [section 14B][22], the applicant may, in accordance with the jury rules, appeal against that decision to the court before which the applicant is summoned to appear.

##### 36A Purpose and application of 2012 amendments on jury service
    
*   (1) The purpose of [Part 1][153] of the Juries (Jury Service and Protection of Particulars of Jury List Information) Amendment Act 2012 is to amend this Act so that it---
        
    *   (a) disqualifies from jury service a person who, at any time within the preceding 5 years, has been sentenced to home detention for a period that is, or is more than, 3 months; and
    
    *   (b) requires a person on whom a court has imposed a sentence of home detention for a period of less than 3 months and who is summoned to serve as a juror on an occasion in a week during which he or she will be subject to the sentence to be permitted to defer that person's attendance to serve as a juror to a date after the person has ceased to be subject to the sentence, or to be excused from serving as a juror on that occasion; and
    
    *   (c) ensures that the Registrar has a discretion or duty to excuse a person summoned to attend as a juror on any occasion from attending not only on that occasion, but also in any court on any occasion, and also that a person who the Registrar has excused from jury service permanently is no longer, unless that permanent excusal is cancelled, qualified and liable to serve as a juror.
    
    (2) The amendments made to this Act by a provision of that Part apply only to a person's attendance to serve as a juror on an occasion after that provision's commencement, but apply to any such attendance even if that person was summoned to attend, sentenced to home detention, or both, before that commencement.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Juries Act 1981\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 29 April 2013, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][167] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][168] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][169] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][170] and [17E][171] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
