    (5) If the High Court transfers a proceeding under subsection (1), the Court of Appeal has the jurisdiction of the High Court to hear and determine the proceeding.

    *   (b) serve a copy of the statement of defence on the plaintiff and any other party.
    
    (2) Unless otherwise ordered by the court,---
        
    *   (a) the place for filing the statement of defence must be the registry of the court in which the statement of claim was filed or into which it has been transferred:
    
    *   (b) the time within which the statement of defence is required to be filed is 25 working days after the day on which the statement of claim and notice of proceeding are served on the defendant.
    
    (3) Subclause (2)(b) is subject to [rule 6.35][725] (which, unless the court otherwise orders, requires a defendant who has been served out of New Zealand to file a statement of defence within 30 working days from the date of service).

##### 5.48 Requirements of statement of defence
    
*   (1) The statement of defence must either admit or deny the allegations of fact in the statement of claim, but a defendant does not have to plead to an allegation that does not affect that defendant.
    
    (2) A denial of an allegation of fact in the statement of claim must not be evasive. Points must be answered in substance. If for example, it is alleged that the defendant received a sum of money, it is not sufficient to deny receipt of the particular amount. Rather, the defendant must deny receipt of that sum or any part of it, or set out how much was received. When a matter is alleged with circumstances it is not sufficient to deny it as alleged with those circumstances. In all cases a fair and substantial answer must be given.
    
    (3) An allegation not denied is treated as being admitted.
    
    (4) An affirmative defence must be pleaded.
    
    (5) The statement of defence must give particulars of time, place, amounts, names of persons, nature and dates of instruments, and other circumstances sufficient to inform the court, the plaintiff, and any other parties of the defendant's defence.

##### 5.49 Appearance and objection to jurisdiction
    
*   (1) A defendant who objects to the jurisdiction of the court to hear and determine the proceeding may, within the time allowed for filing a statement of defence and instead of so doing, file and serve an appearance stating the defendant's objection and the grounds for it.
    
    (2) The filing and serving of an appearance does not operate as a submission to the jurisdiction of the court.
    
    (3) A defendant who has filed an appearance may apply to the court to dismiss the proceeding on the ground that the court has no jurisdiction to hear and determine it.
    
    (4) The court hearing an application under subclause (3) must,---
        
    *   (a) if it is satisfied that it has no jurisdiction to hear and determine the proceeding, dismiss the proceeding; but
    
    *   (b) if it is satisfied that it has jurisdiction to hear and determine the proceeding, dismiss the application and set aside the appearance.
    
    (5) At any time after an appearance has been filed, the plaintiff may apply to the court by interlocutory application to set aside the appearance.
    
    (6) The court hearing that application must,---
        
    *   (a) if it is satisfied that it has jurisdiction to hear and determine the proceeding, set aside the appearance; but
    
    *   (b) if it is satisfied that it has no jurisdiction to hear and determine the proceeding, dismiss both the application and the proceeding.
    
    (7) To the extent that an application under this rule relates to service of process effected outside New Zealand under [rule 6.27][717] or [6.28][718], it must be determined under [rule 6.29][719].
    
    (7A) But both this rule and [rule 6.29][719] are subject to [section 27(1)][1836] of the Trans-Tasman Proceedings Act 2010, which provides that a New Zealand court cannot stay a civil proceeding before it on forum grounds connected with Australia otherwise than in accordance with [subpart 2][1837] of Part 2 of that Act.
    
    (8) The court, in exercising its powers under this rule, may do so on any terms and conditions the court thinks just and, in particular, on setting aside the appearance it may extend the time within which the defendant may file and serve a statement of defence and may give any directions that appear necessary regarding any further steps in the proceeding in all respects as though the application were an application for directions under [rule 7.9][737].
    
    (9) If the appearance set aside has been filed in relation to a proceeding in which the plaintiff has applied for judgment under [rule 12.2][1038] or [12.3][1039], the court---
        
    *   (a) must fix the time within which the defendant may file and serve---
            
        *   (i) a notice of opposition; and
        
        *   (ii) an affidavit by or on behalf of the defendant in answer to the affidavit by or on behalf of the plaintiff; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) may, under subclause (8), give any other directions that appear necessary regarding any further steps in the proceeding.

    *   (b) in the event that any person, already a party, may take some steps in the proceeding adverse to the defendant's interests.
    
    (2) The defendant---
        
    *   (a) may, without filing a statement of defence, file and serve an appearance reserving those rights; and
    
    *   (b) is subsequently entitled to be served with all documents relevant to the rights so reserved that are filed in the proceeding by a person who is or becomes a party.
    
    (3) A defendant who has filed an appearance under subclause (2) may at any time, by leave of the court, file and serve a statement of defence and any other document within the time and upon any terms and conditions prescribed by the court when granting leave.

    *   (b) an award of costs should reflect the complexity and significance of the proceeding:
    
    *   (c) costs should be assessed by applying the appropriate daily recovery rate to the time considered reasonable for each step reasonably required in relation to the proceeding or interlocutory application:
    
    *   (d) an appropriate daily recovery rate should normally be two-thirds of the daily rate considered reasonable in relation to the proceeding or interlocutory application:
    
    *   (e) what is an appropriate daily recovery rate and what is a reasonable time should not depend on the skill or experience of the solicitor or counsel involved or on the time actually spent by the solicitor or counsel involved or on the costs actually incurred by the party claiming costs:
    
    *   (f) an award of costs should not exceed the costs incurred by the party claiming costs:

    Category 3 proceedings Proceedings that because of their complexity or significance require counsel to have special skill and experience in the High Court
    
    (2) The court may at any time determine in advance a proceeding's category, which applies to all subsequent determinations of costs in the proceeding, unless there are special reasons to the contrary.

    *   (b) the property or interests at stake in the proceeding were of exceptionally low value; or
    
    *   (c) the issues at stake were of little significance; or

    (2) Subclause (1) is subject to [section 6][2179] of the Administration Act 1969\.
    
    (3) The order referred to in subclause (1) is as follows:
        
    *   (a) the first in priority is persons having a beneficial interest in the estate, according to the order of priority set out in subclause (4):
    
    *   (b) the second in priority is the Attorney-General, if he or she claims _bona vacantia_ on behalf of the Crown:
    
    *   (c) the third in priority is a creditor of the deceased, or any person who, even though having no immediate beneficial interest in the estate, may have a beneficial interest in the event of an accretion to it.
    
    (4) Persons having a beneficial interest in the estate are entitled to a grant of administration in the following order of priority:
        
    *   (a) the surviving spouse or civil union partner or de facto partner entitled to succeed on the intestacy, if paragraph (b) does not apply and his or her beneficial interest in the estate is not affected,---
            
        *   (i) in the case of a surviving spouse, by section 12(2) of the Matrimonial Proceedings Act 1963 (as applied by [section 191(3)][2180] of the Family Proceedings Act 1980); or
        
        *   (ii) in the case of a surviving spouse or a surviving civil union partner, by [section 26(1)][2181] of the Family Proceedings Act 1980; or

    *   (b) in a case of the kind referred to in [section 77C][2184] of the Administration Act 1969 (succession on intestacy if intestate dies leaving a spouse or a civil union partner and 1 or more de facto partners, or 2 or more de facto partners), a surviving spouse, surviving civil union partner, or surviving de facto partner entitled to succeed on the intestacy, if his or her beneficial interest in the estate is not affected in any of the ways stated in paragraph (a)(i) to (iv):
    
    *   (c) the children of the deceased (including any persons entitled by virtue of the Legitimation Act 1939 or the [Status of Children Act 1969][1801]) or, failing them, the issue of a child who has died during the lifetime of the deceased:

    (6) The [Adoption Act 1955][1791] applies in determining entitlement to a grant in the same way that it applies to devolution of property on intestacy.
    
    (7) If a person has died partially intestate, that is, his or her will has disposed of some but not all of that person's assets, the court must make a single grant of administration for the whole of the estate. The executor, or executors, named in the will has priority in applying for that grant, but otherwise [rule 27.26][1633] applies.

##### 27.36 Justification of entitlement to grant
    
*   (1) When application is made for a grant of letters of administration of the estate of a person who has died wholly intestate and persons other than the applicant would have (if living and competent), under [rule 27.35][1647], a priority higher than or equal to that of the applicant, the applicant---
        
    *   (a) must prove to the satisfaction of the court---
            
        *   (i) that those persons are dead or incompetent; or
        
        *   (ii) that notice of the intended application has been given to them; or
        
        
    
    *   (b) must file their consents in writing, duly verified by affidavit.
    
    (2) Despite subclause (1), the court may, on any conditions that it thinks just, dispense with the giving of notice to, or the obtaining of the consent of, any person who, at the time of the application,---
        
    *   (a) is beyond the jurisdiction of the court; or
    
    *   (b) cannot be found.
    
    (3) The applicant must prove the identity and relationship with the deceased of any person who, under [rule 27.35][1647], has a priority higher than or equal to that of the applicant.
    
    (4) If the applicant is the surviving spouse or the surviving civil union partner, the applicant must prove that at the time of the death of the deceased neither a decree of separation made under section 11 of the Matrimonial Proceedings Act 1963 nor a separation order made under [Part 3][2185] of the Family Proceedings Act 1980 was in force between the applicant and the deceased.
    
    (5) If the applicant is the surviving de facto partner, the applicant must prove that the restrictions on succession imposed by [section 77B][2182] of the Administration Act 1969 do not apply.
    
    (6) Nothing in this rule limits the power of the court to require evidence of other facts necessary to enable the court to decide whether to make a grant to the applicant.
    
    (7) In particular, evidence may be required when it appears that the Crown is or may be entitled to a grant under the law relating to _bona vacantia_.

#### Using High Court Rules forms

##### Purpose of forms

The High Court Rules forms are templates you can use to prepare a document for a proceeding in the High Court.

The forms are grouped as follows:
    
*   general forms (G 1, G 2, etc) are those that the High Court Rules require, or authorise to be used, in a standard High Court proceeding:
*   judgment forms (J 1, J 2, etc) are those used when entering a formal judgment on the court record:
*   enforcement forms (E 1, E 2, etc) are those used when a judgment is being enforced:
*   commercial list forms (CL 1, CL 2, etc) are those used when proceedings are on, or are to be transferred to, the commercial list (Auckland registry only):
*   probate forms (PR 1, PR 2, etc) are those used in connection with applications for probate or administration:
*   admiralty forms (AD 1, AD 2, etc) are those used in the High Court's admiralty jurisdiction over ships and cargo:
*   arbitration forms (Arb 1, Arb 2, etc) are those used when the High Court's jurisdiction is invoked in relation to an arbitration:
*   company forms (C 1, C 2, etc) are those used in relation to a company's liquidation:
*   bankruptcy forms (B 1, B 2, etc) are those used when a person is being adjudicated bankrupt, and in the administration of the bankrupt estate.

##### Preparing forms

Before preparing a form, check whether a High Court Rule applies. The relevant rule number appears at the top of each form. If a rule applies, comply with it.

##### To prepare a document using the forms
    
*   use the general heading as set out in [form G 1][1812] at the beginning of each document or any modified heading indicated:
*   replace text in \[_square brackets_\] with the relevant text:
*   when alternative statements are provided (statement A, statement B, etc), select the relevant statement or statements that apply and omit the others:
*   if required, renumber the numbered paragraphs so that the final document is numbered sequentially:
*   remove all instructions (always in italics) in the documents filed in the High Court or served on other parties---this includes instructions within square brackets, footnotes, and statement labels (statement A, statement B, etc).

##### Format and content of forms

The High Court Rules specify requirements for the presentation of forms. In particular, you should refer to the following rules:
    
*   [Rule 1.21][478]: this rule states that you may vary a prescribed form as the circumstances of the particular case require:
*   [Rules 5.2 to 5.16][598]: these rules indicate how the completed forms should be formatted and how the content should be presented. This includes specifications for page size, margins, numbering of pages, and division of content into numbered paragraphs:
*   [Rule 5.10][606]: this rule prescribes the content and format of the cover sheet of a document. When filing your first document as a party in a proceeding, at the end of it you must set out a memorandum containing prescribed information (_see_ [rule 5.44][647] and [form G 10][1833]).

##### Swearing and affirming

Some documents, eg, affidavits, need to be solemnly verified. A form will indicate this by using the word ""sworn"" at the end of the document. This kind of document must be verified before a person who is authorised to take oaths, such as a solicitor or a Justice of the Peace.

However, under the [Oaths and Declarations Act 1957][1910] you may affirm instead of swearing an oath. ""Affirming"" means ""solemnly, sincerely, and truly declaring and affirming"" the contents of a document.

If you choose to affirm, change ""sworn"" to ""affirmed"" where it occurs in the form.

The parties will also be assisted to identify, define, and refine the issues in dispute.

You must prepare for and attend the first case management conference. You will be expected to have discussed with the plaintiff the matters set out in [Schedule 5][1762] of the High Court Rules. You or your solicitor must file a memorandum relating to the procedural matters set out in [rule 7.3][731] of the High Court Rules.

*   1 The [Maori Language Act 1987][2226] entitles the following persons to speak Māori in legal proceedings: the parties to the proceedings, witnesses, counsel, and, with the leave of the court, other persons.

*   2 If a person intends to speak Māori at all case management conferences and hearings relating to a proceeding or application, the person (or, if the person is a witness, the party intending to call the person as a witness) must, at least 10 working days before the first case management conference or hearing, file this notice in the registry of the court and serve a copy of the notice on every other party to the proceeding or application.

*   3 If a person intends to speak Māori at all case management conferences and hearings after a particular case management conference or hearing, the person (or, if the person is a witness, the party intending to call the person as a witness) must, at least 10 working days before the first case management conference or hearing at which the person intends to speak Māori, file this notice in the registry of the court and serve a copy of the notice on every other party to the proceeding or application.

*   4 If a person intends to speak Māori at a particular case management conference or hearing, the person (or, if the person is a witness, the party intending to call the person as a witness) must, at least 10 working days before the case management conference or hearing, file this notice in the registry of the court and serve a copy of the notice on every other party to the proceeding or application.

*   5 Failure to give notice of intention to speak Māori does not prevent a person speaking Māori at a case management conference or hearing, but the court may---
        
    *   (a) adjourn the conference or hearing to enable the Registrar to arrange for an interpreter to be available at the adjourned case management conference or hearing; and

*   7 The affidavit must be sworn by the applicant and must set out the facts relied on to set the subpoena aside.

#### Form G 28  
Statement of rights and obligations of person served in Australia with subpoena under Evidence Act 2006

[r 9.61][939]

**Important**: This statement is important. Please read the statement and the attached document carefully. If you are in any doubt about this statement or the attached documents, you should get legal advice immediately.

Attached to this statement is a subpoena issued by the High Court of New Zealand. A subpoena is a summons to a witness to give evidence or produce documents. The subpoena attached to this statement requires you to \[_specify whether witness is required to attend the High Court or some other place to give evidence, give evidence and produce documents or things, or only produce documents or things_\].

The subpoena may be served in Australia under [section 156][1900] of the Evidence Act 2006 of New Zealand.

This statement sets out your rights and obligations relating to the subpoena.

##### Your rights
    
*   1 At the time you are served with this subpoena, or at some other reasonable time before the hearing, you are entitled to be paid allowances and travelling expenses, or given vouchers in respect of those allowances and expenses, that cover your reasonable expenses in complying with this subpoena.

*   2 You are not required to comply with this subpoena unless those allowances and travelling expenses or vouchers are tendered to you.

*   3 You are also entitled to be paid for your reasonable expenses in complying with the subpoena in addition to any payment or vouchers tendered to you. You may apply to the High Court of New Zealand for an order specifying that amount.

*   4 You may apply to the High Court of New Zealand to have the subpoena set aside. If you want to have the subpoena set aside, you should get legal advice as soon as possible.

*   5 An application to set the subpoena aside can be made and determined without having to go to New Zealand. You are entitled to have Australian solicitors act for you.

*   6 The High Court of New Zealand may determine the application without a hearing if neither you nor the party who requested the issue of the subpoena requires a hearing. The court may hold a hearing by audio link or audiovisual link if the court thinks fit. If a party applies to the court for a direction to hear the application by audio link or audiovisual link, the court is required to hear it by audio link or audiovisual link.

**Note**: _See_ ""setting subpoena aside"" for details of the grounds on which a subpoena may be set aside and the procedure that must be followed.

##### Your obligations
    
*   7 If the subpoena is not set aside, you must comply with it if---
        
    *   (a) when you were served with the subpoena, or at some reasonable time before the time specified for you to comply, you have been paid or tendered allowances and travelling expenses, or offered vouchers in respect of those allowances and expenses, that are sufficient to cover reasonable expenses incurred in complying with this subpoena; and
    
    *   (b) a copy of the order of the Judge of the High Court of New Zealand granting leave to serve the subpoena was served on you with the subpoena; and
    
    *   (c) you were served with the subpoena not later than the date specified by the Judge of the High Court who granted leave to serve the subpoena; and
    
    *   (d) any other conditions relating to the service of the subpoena have been complied with; and
    
    *   (e) you have attained the age of 18 years.
    
    

*   8 If the subpoena only requires you to produce documents or things, you may comply with the subpoena by producing the documents or things at any registry of an Australian court that is authorised by the law of the Commonwealth of Australia to receive them, not later than 10 days before the date specified in the subpoena for producing them in the High Court of New Zealand. If you produce the documents or things at a registry of an Australian court, you will be required to produce the subpoena and to pay the cost of sending the documents or things to the High Court. You are entitled to have the costs of producing the documents or things, and of sending them to the High Court, paid or tendered to you before you are required to comply with the subpoena.

##### Failure to comply with subpoena
    
*   9 Failure to comply with the subpoena constitutes contempt of the Federal Court of Australia and is punishable unless you establish that the failure to comply should be excused.

##### Setting subpoena aside
    
*   10 You may apply to the High Court of New Zealand to have this subpoena set aside under [section 160][1897] of the Evidence Act 2006 of New Zealand. Section 160 provides that the High Court must set the subpoena aside if---
        
    *   (a) the subpoena requires the witness to attend at a sitting of a court and the High Court is satisfied that---
            
        *   (i) the witness does not have, and cannot by the exercise of reasonable diligence within the time required for compliance obtain, the necessary travel documents; or
        
        *   (ii) the witness is liable to be detained in New Zealand for the purpose of serving a sentence; or
        
        *   (iii) the witness is liable to prosecution for an offence, or is being prosecuted for an offence, in New Zealand; or
        
        *   (iv) the witness is liable to the imposition of a civil penalty in civil proceedings in New Zealand, not being proceedings for a pecuniary penalty under the [Commerce Act 1986][2055]; or
        
        
    
    *   (b) the witness is subject to a restriction on his or her movements, imposed by law or by order of a court, that would prevent the witness complying with the subpoena.
    
    

*   11 [Section 160][1897] further provides that the High Court may set a subpoena aside if it is satisfied that---
        
    *   (a) the evidence of the witness could be obtained satisfactorily without significantly greater expense by other means; or
    
    *   (b) compliance with the subpoena would cause hardship or serious inconvenience to the witness; or
    
    *   (c) in the case of a subpoena that requires a witness to produce documents or things, whether or not it also requires the witness to give oral evidence,---
            
        *   (i) the documents or things should not be taken out of Australia; and
        
        *   (ii) satisfactory evidence of the contents of the documents or evidence of the things can be given by other means.
        
        
    
    

*   12 An application to set the subpoena aside must be filed in the registry of the High Court of New Zealand in which leave to serve the subpoena was given, together with any affidavit setting out the facts on which you rely.

*   13 The application and the affidavit may be sent by fax or email. The fax number and email address of the registry of the court are \[_fax number and email address_\].

*   14 The application must contain an address for service in New Zealand or Australia and may also state a fax number in New Zealand or Australia or email address to which documents relating to the application may be sent.

*   15 The Registrar of the High Court of New Zealand will arrange for service of the application and any affidavit.

*   16 The High Court of New Zealand can decide the application without a hearing if neither you (for example, in the application) nor the party who requested the issue of the subpoena (for example, in a document filed in response to the application) states that a hearing is required. If there is to be a hearing, the hearing may, if the court thinks fit, be by audio link or audiovisual link. You may, however, either in your application to set the subpoena aside or within a reasonable time after filing the application, request that the court direct that the hearing be by audio link or audiovisual link. If you make such a request, the court will direct that the hearing be by audio link or audiovisual link.

The purpose of this schedule is to assist the parties in carrying out discovery in accordance with [subpart 1][819] of Part 8, and to specify detailed requirements for listing and exchanging documents when giving discovery.

## Part 1  
Discovery checklist

##### 1 Assessing proportionality
    
*   The parties must---
        
    *   (a) review the pleadings to identify the categories of documents that would be required if a standard discovery order were made in the terms set out in [rule 8.7][826]; and
    
    *   (b) identify where those documents are likely to be located, including the following:
            
        *   (i) the individuals likely to have those documents or know where they might be located; and
        
        *   (ii) the location and likely volume of any documents held as hard copies or electronically; and
        
        *   (iii) whether other people have discoverable documents within the client's control (for example, lawyers, accountants); and
        
        
    
    *   (c) estimate the likely volume and cost of discovering the above material, including the following matters:
            
        *   (i) the approximate number of hard copy and electronic documents; and
        
        *   (ii) the estimated cost of assembling and discovering those documents (including reviewing for relevance, privilege and confidentiality, and listing the documents); and
        
        *   (iii) whether specialist expertise is required to help the making of informed decisions (including an accurate assessment of the likely costs involved); and
        
        
    
    *   (d) assess and discuss with the other parties whether that estimated cost is proportionate to the sums in issue or the value of the rights in issue in the proceeding. If the cost is disproportionate, or if, having regard to [rules 8.8][827] and [8.9][828], the interests of justice require the making of a tailored discovery order, parties should seek such an order.
    
    

##### 2 Extent of search
    
*   The parties must---
        
    *   (a) assess whether any of the methods identified in [clause 3(2)(a)(ii)][1878] may assist in locating electronic material efficiently; and
    
    *   (b) consider whether it would be appropriate to seek a tailored discovery order about the extent to which a party must search for documents to reflect the circumstances of the case, including (but not limited to) the following:
            
        *   (i) the number of documents involved; and
        
        *   (ii) the nature and complexity of the proceeding; and
        
        *   (iii) the ease and expense of retrieval of any particular document; and
        
        *   (iv) the significance of any document that is likely to be located during the search.
        
        
    
    

##### 3 Tailored discovery
    
*   (1) This clause applies when tailored discovery is appropriate having regard to [rules 8.8][827] and [8.9][828], or when any party intends to apply for an order for tailored discovery.
    
    (2) The parties must---
        
    *   (a) endeavour to agree a proposal in relation to the discovery order that should be made, with respect to the following:
            
        *   (i) _categories_: identify the categories of documents required to be discovered by the parties, and for each category seek to limit discovery to what is reasonable and proportionate. This may be done by, for example, specifying---
                
            *   (A) subject matter:
            
            *   (B) date range:
            
            *   (C) types of documents:
            
            *   (D) key individuals (for example, those who are company directors or are at a specified management level); and
            
            
        
        *   (ii) _methods and strategies for locating documents_: seek agreement on what methods and strategies are appropriate to conduct a reasonable and proportionate search for the documents as identified in paragraph (a), including (but not limited to) the following:
                
            *   (A) appropriate keyword searches; and
            
            *   (B) other automated searches and techniques for culling documents (including concept searching, clustering technology, document prioritisation technology, email threading, and any other new tool or technique); and
            
            *   (C) a method to be used to identify duplicate documents; and
            
            *   (D) whether specialist assistance is required to locate documents efficiently and accurately; and
            
            
        
        
    
    *   (b) discuss whether a staged approach may be appropriate in conjunction with identifying the categories and methods to be adopted by the parties. Parties may agree on---
            
        *   (i) whether any different deadlines are appropriate; and
        
        *   (ii) whether to look initially at select categories (for example, date ranges or key individuals).
        
        
    
    

##### 4 Listing and exchange
    
*   (1) Parties are required by [rules 8.12(2)][831] and [8.27(2)][846] to use the listing and exchange protocol in [Part 2][1880] of this schedule unless a discovery order otherwise requires. Parties must---
        
    *   (a) consider whether the listing and exchange protocol is appropriate and seek to agree any modifications; and
    
    *   (b) if any electronic material contains relevant information that cannot be seen if provided to other parties in paper or image form, consider what special arrangements will be necessary for inspection (for example, unusual software licences are required).
    
    (2) If the parties agree to modify the listing and exchange protocol, the agreement between them must be recorded in writing. The discovery order must record that the parties have agreed to modify the listing and exchange protocol, but it is not necessary for the specific modifications to be contained in the discovery order or be considered by the Judge.
    
    (3) To reduce unnecessary costs of listing documents, parties are encouraged to---
        
    *   (a) use native electronic versions of documents as much as possible; and
    
    *   (b) use the extracted metadata from native electronic documents, instead of manually listing documents; and
    
    *   (c) convert documents to image format only when it is decided they are to be produced for discovery; and
    
    *   (d) if document images are to be numbered, only number those images if they are to be produced for discovery.
    
    

##### 5 Presenting documents at trial
    
*   The parties must---
        
    *   (a) consider with the other parties how documents will be used efficiently and effectively in preparation for and in the conduct of the trial (for example, whether an electronic bundle of documents will be used); and
    
    *   (b) ensure the format adopted for listing and exchange of documents is compatible with any such uses.
    
    

## Part 2

##### 6 Protocol requirements
    
*   (1) Parties are required to---
        
    *   (a) list documents, providing the following detail for each document:

## Part 3  
Glossary

In this schedule, unless the context otherwise requires,---

_attachment_ means any document that is attached to or embedded within another document

_clustering_ means grouping documents by identifying conceptually alike documents

_concept searching_ means a search that attempts to match results with the query conceptually (rather than just by identity or similarity of words)

_de-duplication_ means the process of identifying and removing duplicate documents from a collection of documents so that only 1 unique copy of each document remains. A cryptographic hash function such as the Message Digest algorithm 5 may be used to generate a digital fingerprint for an electronic document. The digital fingerprint of a document can then be electronically compared against the digital fingerprint of any other document to determine whether the documents are exact duplicates. De-duplication may also be implemented by using a cryptographic hash function applied to a group of documents

_document_ has the meaning set out in [rule 1.3][455] of the High Court Rules and includes all ESI

_document description_ means the set of data fields used to describe a document under [clause 7(1)][2296]

_document ID_ has the meaning set out in [clause 7(1)][2296]

_document prioritisation technology_ (**predictive coding**) means technology that analyses the decisions of a human review of a sample set of documents. The software then prioritises/ranks the remainder of documents based on the decisions made on the sample documents, which allows the most relevant documents to be identified first

_electronic image_ or _image_ means an electronic representation of a paper document or electronically stored information. An electronic image may be a searchable image or an unsearchable image

_electronically stored information (ESI)_ means any information stored electronically. It includes, for example, email and other electronic communications such as SMS and voicemail, word processed documents and databases, and documents stored on portable devices such as memory sticks and mobile phones. In addition to documents that are readily accessible from computer systems and other electronic devices and media disks, it includes documents that are stored on servers and back-up systems and electronic documents that have been deleted. It also includes metadata and embedded data

_email threading (email chain)_ means technology that allows the identification of related emails in a thread. This technology can identify the email end point and identify the unique emails in a thread

_keyword search_ means a software-aided search for words across the text of an electronic document

_media disk_ means a CD, DVD, USB flash drive, or any other portable media device

_metadata_ means data about data. In the case of an electronic document, metadata is typically embedded information about the document that is not readily accessible once the native electronic document has been converted into an electronic image or paper document, for example, the date on which the document was last printed or amended. Metadata may be created automatically by a computer system (system metadata) or may be created manually by a user (application metadata). Depending on the circumstances of the case, metadata may be discoverable

_native electronic document_ or _native file format_ means an electronic document stored in the original form in which it was created by a computer software program

_parent document_ means a document with 1 or more attachments. For example, an email is a parent document and any documents attached to the email are its attachments

_party code_ means a sequence of alphanumeric characters in a document ID that uniquely identifies a party in the proceeding

_PDF (portable document format)_ is a file format that enables documents to be displayed or printed in a manner that preserves the formatting originally used by the author. A PDF file may be either a searchable image file or an unsearchable image file

_redaction_ means the process of rendering part of a document unreadable. It is sometimes referred to as masking. Redaction is typically used to render confidential or privileged portions of an otherwise discoverable document unreadable

_searchable image_ means an electronic image in which text-based contents can be searched electronically.

    (2A) Notwithstanding any rule of law to the contrary, it shall not be a bar to the grant of relief in proceedings for a writ or an order of or in the nature of certiorari or prohibition, or to the grant of relief on an application for review, that the person who has exercised, or is proposing to exercise, a statutory power was not under a duty to act judicially; but this subsection shall not be construed to enlarge or modify the grounds on which the court may treat an applicant as being entitled to an order of or in the nature of certiorari or prohibition under the foregoing provisions of this section.
