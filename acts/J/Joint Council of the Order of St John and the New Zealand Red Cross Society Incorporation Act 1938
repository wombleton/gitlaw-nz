An Act to constitute and incorporate the Joint Council of the Order of St John and the New Zealand Red Cross Society
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    Whereas on 18 October 1920, a society known as the New Zealand Branch of the British Red Cross Society and Order of St John, but sometimes also known as the New Zealand Branch of the British Red Cross and Order of St John (hereinafter referred to as the _old Society_), was incorporated under the provisions of the War Funds Act 1915:
    
    And whereas the old Society holds and administers certain war funds within the meaning of the said Act and also holds a capital sum of 30,000 pounds received by the old Society from the Joint Committee in England of the British Red Cross Society and the Order of St John, which capital sum is not a war fund within the meaning of the War Funds Act 1915:
    
    And whereas the New Zealand Red Cross Society (hereinafter referred to as the _Red Cross Society_) on 22 December 1931 was duly incorporated under the provisions of the [Incorporated Societies Act 1908][13], and the Red Cross Society was on 3 June 1932, by Proclamation of the Governor-General of the Dominion of New Zealand, recognised as the National Red Cross Organisation of New Zealand for the purposes of Article 25 of the Covenant of the League of Nations:
    
    And whereas in New Zealand a Commandery has been established of the Grand Priory in the British Realm of the Venerable Order of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem (hereinafter referred to as the _Order_):
    
    And whereas for some years past the income arising from the said capital sum of 30,000 pounds has been administered by a Joint Council of the Order and the Red Cross Society:
    
    And whereas it was intended after the incorporation of the Red Cross Society to dissolve the old Society and it is expedient so to do, but no statutory provisions are in existence for that purpose:
    
    And whereas the similarity in the names of the old Society and the Red Cross Society has resulted in inconvenience and confusion, and it is the desire of the Order and of the old Society that there shall be only one Red Cross Society in New Zealand to avoid confusion and to ensure the more efficient and economical performance of Red Cross work and activities:
    
    And whereas the objects and purposes of the Order and the Red Cross Society are to a large extent similar, and a Joint Council of the Order and the Red Cross Society was formed in 1934 to co-ordinate the charitable work being carried on by the Order and the Red Cross Society with a view to the elimination of overlapping in such work and to increase the usefulness and efficiency of the same:
    
    And whereas the old Society and the Order and the Red Cross Society are desirous that all the funds and property of the old Society, whether war funds within the meaning of the War Funds Act 1915 or not, shall be transferred to the said Joint Council of the Order and the Red Cross Society upon the trusts and for the purposes upon and for which the old Society has heretofore held the same, and that upon such transfer the old Society shall be dissolved:
    
    And whereas it is desired to provide that the said sum of 30,000 pounds and the income thereof shall be expended for the relief of soldiers, sailors, or nurses who served in the Great War in priority to other charitable purposes:
    
    And whereas the old Society and the Order and the Red Cross Society are also desirous that the said Joint Council shall be incorporated with power to hold and administer the said funds and property of the old Society and any other funds.

##### Notes

###### 1 General

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][17] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][19] and [17E][20] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
