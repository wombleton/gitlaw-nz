*   All public and other drains and appliances belonging to the Council and heretofore constructed by or vested in the Corporation shall be deemed to be constructed, maintained, and used under the authority of this Act.

#### Powers of Council

##### 6 Powers vested in Council
    
*   (1.) It shall be lawful for the Council, notwithstanding anything contained in any public Act of the General Assembly or in any by-law now in force, by notice in writing to require the owner of any premises situate within the district to do all or any of the following things, that is,---
        
    *   (a.) provide, construct, and lay new private drains from any part or parts of such premises, and connect such new private drains with such public drain or covered watercourse or street channel as the Council shall direct:
    
    *   (b.) cleanse and repair and relay and alter the course and direction and outfall of or take up and disconnect any existing private drain of or belonging to such premises:
    
    *   (c.) connect any existing private drain with any public drain or with any covered watercourse or street channel, other than the public drain, covered watercourse, or street channel with which the same shall previously have been connected:
    
    *   (d.) provide and affix in or to any such existing private drain, or in and to any such new private drain, all such traps, methods of ventilation, and other sanitary appliances whatever as the Council shall direct:
    
    *   (e.) connect or disconnect any existing or other new private drain with or from any bath, water-closet, urinal, sink, grease-trap, or other sanitary appliance:
    
    *   (f.) execute, provide, and do generally any works, materials, and things which, in the opinion of the Council, shall be necessary or expedient for the efficient drainage of such premises and every part thereof.
    
    (2.) Every such notice as aforesaid shall specify the works, materials, and things to be executed, provided, or done thereunder, and the public drain or covered watercourse or street channel with which any private drain shall be required to be connected, and shall limit a time within which the same works, materials, and things shall be so executed, provided, and done.
    
    (3.) The foregoing powers shall, amongst other things, enable the Council to require any owner of premises to cause the sewage and surface water respectively arising therefrom to be drained by separate drains to separate outfalls:
    
    Provided always that the Council shall not in any such notice require any sewage to be carried into a street channel.
    
    (4.) Any notice, order, or direction purporting to be given or made by or with the authority of the Council, or any officer thereof, shall be deemed to be a notice within the meaning of this Act, or of any by-law under this Act, without proof of such authority, and the issue thereof by any officer of the Council shall be conclusive of the authority of such officer to issue the same unless the same shall be proved to have been issued contrary to the directions of the Council.

##### 7 Provision as to existing private drains
    
*   In any case in which any such existing private drain passes through or serves several separately owned premises, or any such new private drain is to pass through or serve several such separately owned premises, the Council may notify the respective owners of such premises to execute, provide, and do such parts of the works, materials, and things under [section 6][9] hereof as the Council shall in and by the respective notices served on such owners direct. The Council may in any such case elect to do the whole of the work without notifying such respective owners as aforesaid, such election to be signified by notice in writing served on each such owner. The Council may, by any such notice as last aforesaid, declare that any existing or new drain in question shall, as from the time to be mentioned in that behalf in the notice, become a public drain, and the same shall, without any other proceeding, become a public drain accordingly. Neither such election nor such declaration as aforesaid shall prevent the Council from imposing upon the real owners all or any part of the cost of such work under the provisions herein contained.

##### 8 Watercourse or channel dangerous to health may be covered in
    
*   The Council may enclose and cover in or alter any stream, watercourse, or channel within the district which, by reason of sewage or other offensive matter therein, or from any other cause whatever, has or in the opinion of the Council may become a nuisance, or become offensive or dangerous to the public health, and for such purpose may make, construct, and lay down such drains or do such other works as may, in the opinion of the Council, be necessary for the covering of such stream, watercourse, or channel, and the removal therefrom of any sewage or other matter which, in the opinion of the Council, it may be advisable to exclude therefrom, and in connection with such works may straighten or otherwise alter the course and direction of such stream, watercourse, or channel, and take up, disconnect, alter, relay, or otherwise deal with any private drains communicating with such stream, watercourse, or channel; and the Council shall not be liable to pay compensation in respect of any one being deprived of the water flowing in such stream, watercourse, or channel, or of the right to such water, nor of any damage or inconvenience occasioned to the owners or occupiers of such lands or premises, but shall nevertheless make good any damage or injury caused during the construction of the works:
    
    Provided that this section shall not confer upon the Council any further powers in respect of a stream, watercourse, or channel which after leaving the district enters a county than the Council now has by law independently of this Act.

##### 9 Cost of work may be paid by owner by instalments
    
*   Every sum of money payable by any owner of any premises under or by virtue of any provision of this Act hereinbefore or hereinafter contained for or in respect of any work, materials, or things executed, provided, or done by the Council in pursuance of this Act, or of any by-law made hereunder, or any agreement with the Council, may be divided into instalments extending over 5, 10, or 15 years, as the Council may determine, with interest on any such instalment or balance not exceeding the rate of 6 per centum per annum added; and each such instalment and any such interest shall be recoverable in like manner in every respect as if it were a general rate of the borough duly made in respect of the premises in question under the statutory provisions under which the general rate of the borough should or might for the time being be made, and shall generally be deemed to be a general rate within such statutory provisions, subject nevertheless to the following conditions:
        
    *   (a.) the owner for the time being of the premises in question shall in all cases be deemed the person primarily liable for payment of all instalments and interest already due or falling due during his ownership:
    
    *   (b.) the first instalment shall become due on the first day for payment of such general rate after the date to be certified in writing by the Drainage Engineer or Foreman of Works of the Council of the completion of the work in respect whereof the payment is to be made the remaining instalments shall respectively become due on the succeeding days for payment of the general rates until the whole sum with interest is paid:
    
    *   (c.) a separate book shall be kept by the Council in which particulars of all such instalments and of the works in respect whereof they are payable, and of the dates for payment thereof, and of the names of persons paying the same, shall be entered, which book shall be _prima facie_ evidence of the correctness of its contents:
    
    *   (d.) the instalments shall be recoverable as a debt in any court wherein debts are recoverable by action in the name of the Corporation:
    
    *   Provided that no action shall be brought in respect of any instalment after the expiry of 4 years from the date when the same became recoverable.
    
    *   (e.) the owner for the time being may at any time, on giving to the Council 1 calendar month's previous written notice, pay to the Council, and the Council may receive, the whole of the unpaid parts of such sum of money, and such owner shall be entitled to a rebate representing the future interest:
    
    *   (f.) every such instalment or sum, together with the interest thereon, shall, upon the registration of a memorandum thereof, be a charge on the land to which the same relates, whether the same has been sued for or not.

*   In particular, but not so as to limit the general power hereinbefore conferred thereon, the Council may, in manner provided by the Municipal Corporations Act 1900, and its amendments, make, alter, and repeal all such by-laws as it shall think proper for the purpose of carrying out or giving further effect to the provisions of [sections 6][9], [8][11], and [9][12] hereof, or any power vested in the Council by virtue of this Act or any law for the time being in force, and the Council may by such by-laws---
        
    *   (a.) prescribe the forms of any notices, orders, and directions required or contemplated by this Act or by The Municipal Corporations Act 1900, or by any other Act, touching matters connected with the subject of this Act, and direct by whom the same shall or may be signed and the manner of service thereof:
    
    *   (b.) direct in what cases the expense of the works described in all or any of such sections shall be borne by the Council, and in what cases by the owner or owners of the premises, and in what cases (if any) partly by the Council and partly by such owner or owners:
    
    *   (c.) provide for the conclusive ascertainment of the expenses of such works, and of the portion payable by any owner or owners, and of the proportions payable by the respective owners of separately owned premises:
