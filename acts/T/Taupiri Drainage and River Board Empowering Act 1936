*   #### Preamble
    
    WHEREAS the Taupiri Drainage and River Board (hereinafter called the Taupiri Board) was constituted under the provisions of the [Taupiri Drainage and River District Act 1929][5] (hereinafter called the said Act): And whereas under the provisions of the said Act the Mangawara River District, the Hillside Drainage District, the Uapoto Drainage District, the Freshfield Drainage District, and the Woodlands Drainage District have been abolished and the respective Boards of those districts have been dissolved: And whereas under the provisions of the said Act and the [Land Drainage Act 1908][6], the Tauhei Drainage District has been abolished and the Board thereof has been dissolved, and the area formerly comprising that district is now wholly within the limits of the Taupiri Drainage and River District: And whereas under the provisions of the said Act certain lands within the limits of the Taupiri Drainage and River District were excluded from the Eureka Drainage District and from the former Mangawara Drainage District: And whereas all rates and other moneys payable to the Boards dissolved as aforesaid (other than the Mangawara Drainage Board) and some of the rates and other moneys payable to the Mangawara Drainage Board and the Eureka Drainage Board have become payable to the Taupiri Board: And whereas all the liabilities and engagements of the Boards dissolved as aforesaid (other than the Mangawara Drainage Board) and some of the liabilities and engagements of the Mangawara Drainage Board and the Eureka Drainage Board have become liabilities and engagements of the Taupiri Board: And whereas certain areas formerly in the Hillside Drainage District and the Woodlands Drainage District are liable for the payment of special rates payable to the Taupiri Board, but are not included in the Taupiri Drainage and River District: And whereas the Taupiri Board recently converted some of the special loans payable by the Taupiri Board under the provisions of the Local Authorities Interest Reduction and Loans Conversion Act 1932-33: And whereas under the existing law, by reason of the said conversion, difficulties have arisen in the levying of special rates to pay the interest and sinking funds in respect of the loans converted as aforesaid, and the incidence of rating on the various lands in the Taupiri Drainage and River District and on the various lands included in the areas formerly in the Hillside Drainage District and the Woodlands Drainage District, but not included in the Taupiri Drainage and River District, will be materially altered: And whereas it is desirable that such difficulties should be removed and that the incidence of rating above mentioned should not be materially altered: And whereas it is possible to overcome such difficulties and any material alteration to the incidence of rating above mentioned can be avoided by a reclassification of all lands liable to be rated for special rates in respect of the loans converted as aforesaid:

BE IT THEREFORE ENACTED by the General Assembly of New Zealand in Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:---

##### 1 Short Title
    
*   This Act may be cited as the Taupiri Drainage and River Board Empowering Act 1936\.

##### 3 Grounds of appeal against classification restricted
