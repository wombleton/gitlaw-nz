*   #### Preamble
    
    (1) The [Treaty of Waitangi][164] is set out, in Maori and English, in [Schedule 1][150]:
    
    ###### Land Claims Commission
    
    (2) Te Uri o Hau participated in several transactions that were claimed to have been purchases made by individual Europeans in the Kaipara area in 1839 and 1840\. Te Uri o Hau participants in these transactions sought to promote settlement and trade opportunities by entering into these transactions:
    
    (3) The Land Claims Commission was established to investigate land transactions that occurred in New Zealand prior to 14 January 1840, in order to determine whether they were equitable. Between 1841 and 1844, the Commission heard claims relating to land in which Te Uri o Hau had interests. The Land Claims Commission inquired into whether a transaction occurred or not, and generally validated those claims where Maori supported the transaction, but did not explore possible broader Maori expectations regarding the transactions:
    
    (4) Four of these claims were further considered by the Bell Commission in the 1850s. Two of those claims were not pursued by the settler claimants, but the Crown provided some compensation to the settlers for previous outlay and made further payments to Maori. In respect of the 2 claims that were pursued, the Commissioner made awards of land to the European claimants. Approximately 6 000 acres of the land under claim was retained by the Crown as surplus. Of this 6 000 acres, the Crown later purchased approximately 5 400 acres of the same area from Maori:
    
    ###### Te Kopuru land
    
    (5) In 1842, the Protector of Aborigines prevailed on chiefs of Te Uri o Hau and Nga Puhi to cede an area of land as restitution for the plunder of the store of a local resident. Maori suspected that the store owner had desecrated an urupa and removed human remains. Representative chiefs selected an area of land at Te Kopuru for this purpose. The Crown made no payment for the land and retained the area as punishment for the plunder. Uncertainty surrounded the boundaries of the ceded block and the area does not appear to have been surveyed until 1857, when land to the south of Te Kopuru was purchased by the Crown. It is estimated that the block contained 6 000 to 8 000 acres:
    
    ###### Pre-1865 purchases
    
    (6) The first Crown purchases involving Te Uri o Hau land occurred in 1854\. By 1865, approximately 300 000 acres in the northern Kaipara area had been alienated:
    
    (7) These early Crown purchases were characterised by the following features:
        
    *   (a) inter-iwi rivalry between the groups of Nga Puhi/Te Parawhau and Te Uri o Hau/Ngati Whatua with regard to the ownership of blocks that the Crown sought to purchase:
    
    *   (b) approximately 60% of land in the northern Kaipara area in which Te Uri o Hau had interests was purchased before 1865:
    
    *   (c) a small number of areas, including Paraheke (which was reserved from the purchase of the Oruawharo Block), were reserved from purchases made in the Otamatea area in which Te Uri o Hau had interests. The 2 areas reserved from purchases on the Pouto peninsula were almost entirely alienated within a few years of their exclusion from the purchases:
    
    (8) The Crown's purchase in 1854 of the Mangawhai block was notable in that the Deed stated that ""ten per cent of the proceeds of the sale of this block of land by the Queen is to be expended for the benefit of the Natives"". There was performance of this clause up to 1874\. No further payments were made after this date:
    
    ###### Operations of Native land laws and purchases 1865--1900
    
    (9) The Native Land Court began title investigation in the Kaipara area from 1864 onwards. A number of mostly small blocks in which Te Uri o Hau had an interest were heard by the Court in the late 1860s and early 1870s in the Otamatea region. Little land was alienated during this time and revenue was generated through leasing the land:
    
    (10) By the late 1870s/early 1880s, use of the Court by Te Uri o Hau was restricted to blocks of land that they intended to sell. Te Uri o Hau subsequently introduced to the Court, and sold, large areas of land:
    
    (11) The complexity of the Native Land Laws was an issue in the sale of the Okahukura block. Te Uri o Hau non-seller Hemana Whiti agreed to the transfer of the block after reaching an agreement with the private purchaser. The witnessed and signed agreement documented that 100 acres was to be reconveyed to Hemana Whiti subsequent to the block's sale. The Court's inability to give legal recognition to this agreement due to a provision in the Native Land Act 1873, however, saw Hemana Whiti evicted from his land and his property destroyed. Successive Governments did not intervene in this legal dispute:
    
    (12) Advance payments were made by the Crown to rangatira of Te Uri o Hau prior to title investigation by the Native Land Court, in an attempt to secure the purchase of blocks following the determination of title. Such payments occurred, for example, in Crown purchases of the Tikinui block and Pouto Point:
    
    (13) Reserves set aside in land purchases in which Te Uri o Hau had an interest often included Wahi Tapu sites and several reserves were made inalienable but were subsequently alienated. Additionally, some of the reserves were awarded exclusively to individual Maori, thus leaving the reserves subject to partition and succession. The consequence of this was fragmentation:
    
    (14) The Validation Court, which was established to hear claims from those seeking to ""validate"" incomplete dealings in Maori land, investigated the alleged purchase of 2 200 acres of Pouto land in 1893 and 1897\. The operative land legislation enabled the Validation Court to rule in favour of a provisional and disputed purchase agreement between a settler and Te Uri o Hau, and allowed it to be validated despite strong objections from Te Uri o Hau:
    
    ###### Desecration of urupa and other Wahi Tapu
    
    (15) Taonga were taken from Wahi Tapu in the Wairoa--Kaipara district and the Pouto peninsula without the permission of the tangata whenua, despite Maori concerns about the violation of Wahi Tapu:
    
    (16) Specific legislation to provide some protection for taonga did not exist until 1901\. This legislation restricted the export of Maori antiquities:
    
    ###### 20th century land administration
    
    (17) The Taitokerau District Maori Land Board was created under the Maori Land Settlement Act 1905\. Some Te Uri o Hau land was compulsorily vested in the Land Board, after 1905, for lease. Later legislation allowed some land to be sold by the Board without the permission of the owners. The mandate of the owners was required in other cases:
    
    (18) Due to the existing private and State lending criteria, attempts to obtain development finance by some Te Uri o Hau landowners were unsuccessful. State funding was provided after 1929 to assist in the economic development of the land in Kaipara:
    
    (19) The operative land administration legislation gave the Minister of Maori Affairs, followed by the Board of Maori Affairs, substantial powers, leaving the landowners with few, if any, legal powers over their own land:
    
    (20) In 1930, all land owned by Maori within the Kaipara area was brought under the provisions of Maori land development legislation. Maori could enter into land development schemes either through station development or smaller individual ""unit"" schemes. From the 1940s, Maori owners were progressively distanced from the schemes' administration, due to a number of political and economic changes:
    
    (21) Administrative and economic difficulties, with little immediate prospect of land being released from State control, may have encouraged some landowners to sell their interests in scheme land to the Crown. The Crown actively promoted such sales with legislation to foster ""live buying"" of Maori land interests. These interests were retained by the Crown in many instances and later became available for repurchase by the remaining owners:
    
    (22) The long-term benefits of the schemes have been variable. Some of the schemes have had positive outcomes. However, some of the individual ""unit"" schemes, in particular, were of limited economic benefit and failed to fulfil the owners' expectations:
    
    ###### Settlement of claim
    
    (23) Through enactment of the Treaty of Waitangi Amendment Act 1985, the Crown made it possible for Maori to bring claims before the Waitangi Tribunal in respect of historic grievances arising after 6 February 1840:
    
    (24) Claims were registered on behalf of Te Uri o Hau with the Waitangi Tribunal that sought redress for Te Uri o Hau historical grievances, including WAI 229 and WAI 271 lodged by Russell Kemp in August 1991 and Ross Wright in November 1991 respectively:
    
    (25) Most of Te Uri o Hau claims were heard before the Waitangi Tribunal from June 1997 to July 1998 as part of the Kaipara Stage One Hearings. The Tribunal has not reported on the Kaipara hearings as it has yet to hear all of the claims in the Kaipara area:
    
    (26) On 14 June 1999 the Crown recognised the mandate of the mandated negotiators to represent Te Uri o Hau in negotiations with the Crown for a final and comprehensive settlement of the Te Uri o Hau historical claims:
    
    (27) The 2 parties then entered into negotiations that resulted in the mandated negotiators for Te Uri o Hau and the Crown entering into a Heads of Agreement dated 20 November 1999\. The Heads of Agreement recorded in principle that Te Uri o Hau and the Crown were willing to settle Te Uri o Hau historical claims by entering into a deed of settlement:
    
    (28) The Crown and Te Uri o Hau executed a deed of settlement on 13 December 2000\. The deed of settlement acknowledged that Te Uri o Hau suffered injustices that impaired the economic, social and cultural development of Te Uri o Hau and recorded the matters required to give effect to a settlement of all the historical claims of Te Uri o Hau.

Ko te tino take, ko nga hokonga whenua tomua mo nga take nohonga tangata i pa atu ki te whakahiatonga o Aotearoa, a, e whakatau ana hoki i te piringa o Te Uri o Hau ki te Karauna:

Kihei nga hokonga whenua tomua me nga hiatonga whenua o nga rautau rua tekau i whakaputa i nga whiwhinga me nga hua a-ohaoha kia rite ki era i tumanakohia ai e Te Uri o Hau. I pera ano hoki nga kaupapa a te Poari Whenua a-Rohe Maori o Te Tai Tokerau me te Tari Maori mo te hiatonga:

##### 8 Text in English of acknowledgments by the Crown
    
*   The text in English of the acknowledgements is as follows:
    
    > "The Crown acknowledges the historical claims and the breaches of [Te Tiriti o Waitangi/the Treaty of Waitangi][167] and its principles by the Crown in relation to Te Uri o Hau historical claims as follows:
    >     
    > *   "(a) The Crown recognises that Te Uri o Hau endeavoured to preserve and strengthen their relationship with the Crown. In particular, the early land transactions for settlement purposes contributed to development of New Zealand and affirmed the loyalty of Te Uri o Hau to the Crown:
    > 
    > *   "(b) The Crown acknowledges that the benefits that Te Uri o Hau expected to flow from this relationship were not always realised. Early land transactions and twentieth century land development, including the Tai Tokerau Maori District Land Board and the Maori Affairs development schemes initiated in the 1930s, did not provide the economic opportunities and benefits that Te Uri o Hau expected:
    > 
    > *   "(c) The Crown acknowledges that the process used to determine the reparation for the plunder of a store, which led Te Uri o Hau chiefs and others to cede land at Te Kopuru as punishment for the plunder, was prejudicial to Te Uri o Hau. The Crown acknowledges that its actions may have caused Te Uri o Hau to alienate lands that they wished to retain and that this was a breach of [Te Tiriti o Waitangi/the Treaty of Waitangi][167] and its principles:
    > 
    > *   "(d) The Crown acknowledges that a large amount of Te Uri o Hau land has been alienated since 1840 and that it failed to provide adequate reserves for the people of Te Uri o Hau. The Crown also acknowledges that it did not ensure that there was sufficient protection from alienation for the few reserves that were provided. This failure by the Crown to set aside reserves and protect lands for the future use of Te Uri o Hau was a breach of [Te Tiriti o Waitangi/the Treaty of Waitangi][167] and its principles:
    > 
    > *   "(e) The Crown acknowledges that the operation and impact of the Native land laws (including the laws governing the operation of the Validation Court) had a prejudicial effect on those of Te Uri o Hau who wished to retain their land and that this was a breach of [Te Tiriti o Waitangi/the Treaty of Waitangi][167] and its principles. The Crown also acknowledges that the awarding of reserves exclusively to individual Te Uri o Hau made those reserves subject to partition, succession and fragmentation, which had a prejudicial effect on Te Uri o Hau; and
    > 
    > *   "(f) The Crown acknowledges that this loss of control over land has prejudiced Te Uri o Hau and hindered the economic, social, and cultural development of Te Uri o Hau. It has also impeded their ability to exercise control over their taonga and wahi tapu and maintain and foster spiritual connections to their ancestral lands."

##### 9 Text in Maori of apology by the Crown

    > 
    > "E tino whakamomori ake ana te Karauna ki te tapae i tona he me te kaniawhea tonu ki ana mahi ki te kore e tohu kia tau nga whenua mo Te Uri o Hau, i pa ai te awenga me te tukunga iho waroa, ko te huanga mai ki te rarutanga o te mana whakahaere a Te Uri o Hau mo te nuinga o ona whenua."
    
    

##### 10 Text in English of apology by the Crown
    
*   The text in English of the apology is as follows:
    
    > "The Crown apologises to the ancestors of Te Uri o Hau and to their descendants for the breaches of [Te Tiriti o Waitangi/the Treaty of Waitangi][167] and its principles acknowledged above.
    > 
    > "The Crown unreservedly apologises and profoundly regrets that its actions, in failing to preserve sufficient lands for Te Uri o Hau, have had pervasive and enduring consequences, resulting in Te Uri o Hau losing control over the majority of their lands."

## Schedule 3  
Kirihipi overlay area for Manukapua Government Purpose (Wildlife Management) Reserve

[s 39][49]

#### _Description of area_

The area to which this schedule applies is the area known as the Manukapua Government Purpose (Wildlife Management) Reserve, as shown on SO Plan 70052\.

#### _Preamble_

Under [section 42][52] of Te Uri o Hau Claims Settlement Act 2002 (clause 5.1.3 of the deed of settlement), the Crown acknowledges the statement by Te Uri o Hau of the cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional values of Te Uri o Hau relating to Manukapua Government Purposes (Wildlife Management) Reserve, as set out below.

#### _Statement of values by Te Uri o Hau relating to Manukapua_

Manukapua (cloud of birds) is extremely significant to Te Uri o Hau because it is the remains of Taporapora, the tauranga waka (landing place) of our ancestral waka (canoe), the Mahuhu ki te Rangi.

When the Mahuhu ki te Rangi and its crew arrived in the Kaipara region from Hawaiki, they named the tauranga waka Taporapora after a remembered place in Hawaiki. Te Uri o Hau traditional history recalled by our kaumatua and kuia states that Taporapora was then a peninsula that extended from the present day location of Manukapua out to the Tasman sea creating a north and south channel at the mouth of the Kaipara Harbour.

Rongomai (Ariki of the Mahuhu ki te Rangi) and some crew members settled and built their wharenui (meeting house) on Taporapora. The tupuna (ancestors) used the wharenui to recite ancient knowledge, karakia (incantation), waiata (songs) and whakapapa (genealogy) with rangatira (chiefs) from around the region. This wharenui housed their taonga (treasures) brought with them from Hawaiki.

Rongomai married a wahine (woman) from the surrounding area and relocated his kaianga (village) from Taporapora to Manukapua and the Okahukura peninsula. From this kaianga he used the surrounding land and water to gather kai (food) for the people. Te Uri o Hau whaikorero (oration) passed down from generation to generation talks of Rongomai's drowning and of a great tempest that washed away Taporapora because Rongomai did not perform the appropriate karakia before he went fishing.

For Te Uri o Hau, histories such as these represent the links and the continuity between past and present generations. They reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and document the events that shaped Te Uri o Hau as a people.

It is only evident at high tide that Manukapua is an island. At low tide one is able to walk from the Okahukura peninsula to Manukapua. One can also see the remains of the whenua (land) of Taporapora at low tide.

For many generations and still today the waters surrounding Manukapua provide kaimoana (seafood) such as patiki (flounder), kanae (mullet), pioke (shark), tamure (snapper), kuakua (scallop), pipi, and kutae (mussel) for Te Uri o Hau. The shifting sandbars of the Kaipara Harbour protect this source of kai for Te Uri o Hau. The whenua of Manukapua and the surrounding area provided manu (birds) of many species and many of those species still nest and roost here today.

The mauri (life force) of Manukapua represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship for Te Uri o Hau.

## Schedule 4  
Kirihipi overlay area for Pouto stewardship area

[s 39][49]

#### _Description of area_

The area to which this schedule applies is the area known as the Pouto stewardship area, as shown on SO Plan 70051\.

#### _Preamble_

Under [section 42][52] of Te Uri o Hau Claims Settlement Act 2002 (clause 5.1.3 of the deed of settlement), the Crown acknowledges the statement by Te Uri o Hau of the cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional values of Te Uri o Hau relating to Pouto stewardship area, as set out below.

#### _Statement of values by Te Uri o Hau relating to Pouto_

Te Uri o Hau have a very special relationship with this area. It is recognised as a major Wahi Tapu (sacred area) because many of our tupuna (ancestors) are buried here. Many urupa (burial grounds) and taonga (treasures) rest beneath the whenua (land) in this region as a result of the many battles that were fought here throughout Te Uri o Hau history. During extreme weather conditions wheua (human bones) are often exposed.

Traditionally Te Uri o Hau used this region extensively for gathering kai (food). The fresh water lakes provided an abundance of kai for Te Uri o Hau. In 1909 a Te Uri o Hau rangatira said ""These lakes are where we fish for eels, net mullet and snare birds for our food. They have been with us since the beginning, handed down by our tupuna to our parents and to us today"".

For Te Uri o Hau, histories such as these represent the links and the continuity between past and present generations. They reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and document the events that shaped Te Uri o Hau as a people.

Traditionally there were many Nohoanga (temporary settlements) within this area. Te Uri o Hau whanau (families) from the Pouto peninsula and from other marae around the Kaipara Harbour would camp here catching tuna (eels) and kanae (mullet) from the lakes and gathering manu (birds), harakeke (flax), and berries from the wetlands and surrounding area.

Te Uri o Hau are the kaitiaki (guardians) of this area. Knowledge of the traditional trails and Nohoanga sites handed down from generation to generation is a taonga (treasure) to Te Uri o Hau. A hikoi (walk) along the trails allows Te Uri o Hau to rebury wheua (human remains) and taonga (treasures) should they become exposed by the drifting sand.

The mauri (life force) of this region represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship for Te Uri o Hau with this region.

## Schedule 6  
Statutory acknowledgement for Mangawhai marginal strip

[s 59][72]

#### _Statutory area_

The area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies (**statutory area**) is the area known as the Mangawhai marginal strip, as shown on SO Plan 70049\.

#### _Preamble_

Under [section 59][72] of Te Uri o Hau Claims Settlement Act 2002 (clause 5.2.3 of the deed of settlement), the Crown acknowledges the statement by Te Uri o Hau of the cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association of Te Uri o Hau with the Mangawhai marginal strip as set out below.

#### _Cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association of Te Uri o Hau with the statutory area_

The land now known as the Mangawhai marginal strip is of great importance to Te Uri o Hau.

This area was traditionally used by Te Uri o Hau as one of the many areas where kaimoana (seafood) was gathered during certain periods of the year. Mahinga kai and Nohoanga sites are prevalent throughout the Mangawhai area. Te Uri o Hau traditionally participated in many fishing expeditions from the coastline.

Around 1825, the battle known as Te Ika Ranganui began at Mangawhai and progressively moved inland towards Otamatea and on into the Kaipara Harbour. The battle was fought between the tangata whenua and northern iwi.

For many years following the battle, this area was tapu (sacred) to Te Uri o Hau. The bones of our people who died during the battle or as a result of the battle are scattered throughout this area.

The mauri (life force) of the Mangawhai and adjacent coastline represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Te Uri o Hau with the Mangawhai coast.

## Schedule 7  
Statutory acknowledgement for Oruawharo River stewardship area

[s 75][92]

#### _Statutory area_

The area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies (**statutory area**) is the area known as the Oruawharo River stewardship area, as shown on SO Plan 70050\.

#### _Preamble_

Under [section 59][72] of Te Uri o Hau Claims Settlement Act 2002 (clause 5.2.3 of the deed of settlement), the Crown acknowledges the statement by Te Uri o Hau of the cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association of Te Uri o Hau with the Oruawharo River stewardship area as set out below.

#### _Cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association of Te Uri o Hau with the statutory area_

Te Uri o Hau whaikorero (oration) about this area goes back to the era of our eponymous ancestor, Haumoewaarangi, when Te Uri o Hau first resided in the north Kaipara region. This area is very important to Te Uri o Hau because of the Wahi Tapu (sacred ground) and the urupa (burial grounds) where our tupuna (ancestors) rest.

A wahine (woman) named Te Hana lived at Mahipatua Pa on the Pouto peninsula. Her whakapapa (genealogy) links were from a different tribe that lived peacefully among Te Uri o Hau at that time. Te Hana was betrothed to Rangiwhapapa, brother of Haumoewaarangi, who resided at a nearby kainga (village) called Rangitane Pa.

A warrior from Oporo Pa, which was located at the mouth of the Oruawharo River on the Okahukura peninsula, had heard of this beautiful woman that lived across the Wairoa River at Mahipatua Pa. He visited Te Hana's kainga in the hope of gaining her affections for himself. As Te Hana was puhi (a virgin of noble family who was kept for the right match) she could not participate in the ceremonies but could only watch from a distance.

Te Uri o Hau traditions state that the visiting warrior casted a spell of atahu (love charm) over Te Hana so that her affections would be diverted to him. In time the spell began to weave its magic. Early one morning Te Hana and her maid sneaked down to the Wairoa River. They swam across the Wairoa River to the Okahukura peninsula, stopping to rest on the sandbanks on their way. While crossing the first channel, Te Hana's maid looked back to the Pouto peninsula and subsequently drowned. Te Hana, however, made it over to the other side and landed on Manukapua Island where she was found and taken to Oporo Pa.

On hearing of Te Hana's disappearance, and knowing where she had gone, Rangiwhapapa and his taua (war party) left Pouto for Okahukura. It is said that the waters of the Wairoa were black with canoes in their quest to retrieve Te Hana. A great battle took place and many lives were lost from both sides. The battle was fought along the ridge from Oporo Pa to Whakahuranga Pa and the invading taua from Pouto pushed the inhabitants of Okahukura out of the region. Te Hana was taken back to Pouto where she married Rangiwhapapa. The area known as the Oruawharo stewardship area is still tapu (sacred) today.

For Te Uri o Hau, histories such as this represent the links and the continuity between past and present generations. They reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and document the events that shaped Te Uri o Hau as a people.

Until recently, the shores and banks of this area were used as Nohoanga (temporary settlements) by Te Uri o Hau when they returned to this area from the Pouto peninsula, Manukapua Island and the Kaipara Harbour after gathering kai (food) for the people. As kaitiaki (guardians) Te Uri o Hau would also keep watch over the Wahi Tapu sites in this area during their journeys around the Kaipara Harbour.

The mauri (life force) of this area represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force and all life is related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship for Te Uri o Hau with the Oruawharo River stewardship area.

The maunga (mountain) Pukekaroro is of great importance to Te Uri o Hau. Pukekaroro was a key strategic site for Te Uri o Hau, as from the very top you are able to see the Mangawhai Heads to the east and the Kaipara Harbour entrance to the west. Traditionally Te Uri o Hau used the timber that grew on the mountain to build waka, which were renown for their seaworthiness.

During the battle known as Te Ika Ranganui in 1825, Karoro, a rangatira who had a pa site at the very top of the mountain retrieved many Te Uri o Hau dead and wounded from the surrounding area and carried them up to the pa so they would not be found by the enemy. Pukekaroro is of special spiritual significance to Te Uri o Hau because of the many Wahi Tapu (sacred area) sites on the mountain. The mountain has been tapu (sacred) since that battle and remains so today.

The mauri (life force) of Pukekaroro represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force and all life is related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Te Uri o Hau with Pukekaroro.

## Schedule 9  
Statutory acknowledgement for Kaipara Harbour coastal area

[s 59][72]

#### _Statutory area_

The area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies (**statutory area**) is the area known as the Kaipara Harbour, as shown on SO Plan 70053\.

#### _Preamble_

Under [section 59][72] of Te Uri o Hau Claims Settlement Act 2002 (clause 5.2.3 of the deed of settlement), the Crown acknowledges the statement by Te Uri o Hau of the cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association of Te Uri o Hau with the Kaipara Harbour as set out below.

#### _Cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association of Te Uri o Hau with the statutory area_

Te Uri o Hau has used the Kaipara Harbour for food and other resource gathering since long before 1840 and continue to do so today. Te Uri o Hau are kaitiaki (guardians) of the harbour and its resources.

There are many traditional land blocks surrounding the harbour that take their names from indigenous species that live within the Kaipara Harbour environs. There are natural features, which include sandbanks and reefs that have also been named after tupuna of Te Uri o Hau. Many whanau have also been given names that refer to these features. Indeed the very name given to the harbour, Kai meaning food and Para meaning king fern, is our acknowledgment of the sustenance obtained by our people in and around the harbour.

The Kaipara Harbour is a primary source of life and well being for Te Uri o Hau. The harbour has provided kaimoana (seafood) as well as communication routes. This is obvious in the placement of nga marae tuturu (the ancestral marae) of Te Uri o Hau at the headlands and on the foreshores of the harbour. Te Uri o Hau believe that water is the very life force of our people, a basic and core element providing for our own existence.

The harbour is a flowing together of the waters of many rivers as elaborated in the whaikorero (oral history) of our tupuna (ancestors) and honoured by each generation thereafter. The harbour has always been of the utmost importance to Te Uri o Hau.

#### _Oruawharo River_

The Oruawharo River was named after a rangatira, Ruawharo, who resided in the area around the river. The land adjoining the river, where the Te Uri o Hau marae ""Rangimarie"" is sited is also named Oruawharo.

Te Uri o Hau have long gathered kaimoana (seafood) from this river and continue to do so today, particularly from the oyster reserve located on the river.

It was on this river that the first settlement of Albertlanders from Manchester was established in the Kaipara area. This settlement not only provided Te Uri o Hau with a market for their goods, but also enabled Te Uri o Hau and the settlers to interact with each other and learn from each other.

As you travel from the mouth of the Oruawharo River, towards the east, you reach the Topuni River, meaning the Rainbow River. Sometimes a rainbow forms above the meeting point of the Oruawharo River and the Topuni River. This rainbow, which can be seen at night as well as in the daylight, is vertical rather than a bow. When this rainbow is present, Te Uri o Hau believe that war is inevitable.

The mauri (life force) of the Oruawharo River represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Te Uri o Hau with the Oruawharo River.

#### _Wairoa River_

The Wairoa River is one of the traditional communication links for all of Te Uri o Hau marae around the Kaipara Harbour. The awa (river) was used extensively throughout Te Uri o Hau history and last century prior to roads being established. Te Uri o Hau pa (fortified villages) sites, urupa (burial grounds) and Wahi Tapu (sacred areas) line the shores of the Wairoa River. The Waikaretu Marae was formerly located on the banks of the Wairoa River. It has now been relocated to higher ground.

The association of Te Uri o Hau with the Wairoa River has always been part of our history. Because it is the major transportation river of the northern Kaipara Harbour, many of Te Uri o Hau traditional histories involve the Wairoa. The numerous sandbanks and reefs along the length of the Wairoa River feature in many aspects of Te Uri o Hau history. Rongomai (Ariki of the Mahuhu ki te Rangi our ancestral waka) drowned on the west side of the Wairoa River; Mahanga (a Te Uri o Hau tupuna) and his people drowned at sandbanks now called ""Te Wai a Mahanga"" (the waters of Mahanga) and Te Hana (an important maiden in Te Uri o Hau history) rested on three sandbanks of the Wairoa during her swim to Okahukura. Te Uri o Hau kaumatua and kuia also speak of the taniwha (river guardians) whose presence may be observed at times.

For Te Uri o Hau, histories such as these represent the links and the continuity between past and present generations. They reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and document the events that shaped Te Uri o Hau as a people.

The resources of the Wairoa River have sustained Te Uri o Hau for generations and still do today, although to a lesser degree. The kaimoana (seafood) of the Wairoa River is special to Te Uri o Hau and is considered a taonga (treasure). Te Uri o Hau historically guarded this taonga with extreme jealousy, threatening to kill anyone caught taking their resources without permission, especially if those caught did not belong to the tribe.

The mauri (life force) of the Wairoa River represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force and all forms of life are related. Mauri is critical element of the spiritual relationship for Te Uri o Hau.

#### _Otamatea River_

The Otamatea is a tidal tributary of the Kaipara Harbour. The land block known as ""Ranganui"" meaning the great spur divides the eastern end of the Otamatea into the Wairau River flowing northeast and the Kaiwaka River flowing southeast.

Te Uri o Hau know the part of the Otamatea River that is in front of the Ranganui as the Ranganui River. This part of the Otamatea River was crucial to Te Uri o Hau transportation and communication routes when travelling around the inner parts of their rohe. Traditionally Te Uri o Hau would travel by waka, past Ranganui, onto the Kaiwaka Creek, and then on to Mangawhai to gather kaimoana. As you travel down the Ranganui River toward the northeast you arrive at the Wairau River, which takes you into the township of Maungaturoto. To the southeast, the Ranganui River flows into the Kaiwaka River, which flows into the Kaiwaka township.

Otamatea was named after Tamatea, a visitor from a distant region who traveled extensively throughout Aotearoa. When Tamatea came to the Ranganui River he found footprints along the banks of the tidal creek running from Kaiwaka into the Ranganui River, which indicated that the area was inhabited. In fact the area was inhabited by Te Uri o Hau of Ngati Whatua who claimed to have been in the area since before the great migration.

Tamatea did not see Te Uri o Hau as they surrounded him. But he soon realised that he was surrounded and had no way to escape but to swim the river. Tamatea decided to call his God, Raiera, to come and protect him. Raiera came to him in the shape of a rock by the bank. Tamatea climbed on the rock and it drifted into the middle of the river. Out of curiosity Te Uri o Hau stormed the foreshore and induced Tamatea to return ashore. Tamatea accepted their invitation and thereafter Tamatea was greatly welcomed.

Before returning to the eastern coast, Tamatea said ""In recognition of your kindness and hospitality, I will leave my God, Raiera, in this river as a bridge for my descendants in days to come"". It is called Te Toka Turangi (the Rock of Tamatea) and the river was thereafter called Otamatea. Raiera has been seen at low tide, where the Kaiwaka Creek meets the Ranganui River and then on to the Otamatea River. It was last seen washed ashore at half tide mark outside Aotearoa Marae when Arama Karaka Haututu the Second died in the late 19th or early 20th century.

Some years after Tamatea left, his son lived in the Kaipara area for many years, before returning to the eastern coast. His descendants reside at Otamatea and Oruawharo today.

The Otamatea River played an important part in the life of Te Uri o Hau as part of their traditional communication routes in ancient times and continues to be important today. The Otamatea River is of great spiritual importance to Te Uri o Hau as there are many pa, Wahi Tapu (sacred areas) and urupa (burial sites) along both sides of the river. This river is also renowned for the many species of kaimoana that Te Uri o Hau used.

The mauri (life force) of the Otamatea River represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Te Uri o Hau with the Otamatea River.

#### _Arapaoa River_

The Arapaoa River received its name, which in translation means Smoky Pathway, when Te Uri o Hau burnt off the scrub around the river once the land around the river was recognised as having good soil for planting crops. Te Uri o Hau Kaumatua and Kuia have said that the smoke was so thick that you had to take every precaution when travelling up the river.

The Arapaoa River flows east into the Pahi River and Paparoa Creek moving in a northerly direction. Te Uri o Hau have a spiritual connection with the Arapaoa River, which is evident today by the many Wahi Tapu (sacred area) sites that can be seen along the river. The river was also one of the main kaimoana (seafood) gathering places, and many Nohoanga (temporary settlements) sites were established along both sides of the river.

Many of Te Uri o Hau wounded from the battle known as Te Ika Ranganui in 1825 died along the shores of the Arapaoa River.

The mauri of the Arapaoa River represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force and all forms of life are related. Mauri is critical element of the spiritual relationship of Te Uri o Hau with the Arapaoa River.

#### _Whakakei River_

Whakakei means ""to lift the harvest"" or to ""lift the nets"". The Whakakei was well known for the big snapper that could be caught there due to the shellfish and worms found only in this area. The shellfish were similar to the toheroa and the shells of these species are still found today on the land as well as in the tidal mud flats. Because of the tremendous resources of this river, Pakarahaki, a rangatira of Te Uri o Hau, reserved it as his own fishing ground.

Te Uri o Hau have spiritual connections to the Whakakei river as seen by the many Wahi Tapu (sacred areas) sites on both sides of the river. The many kaimoana (seafood) species that Te Uri o Hau would seasonally gather from the river are evident from the many middens within the traditional Nohoanga (temporary settlements) areas.

As you travel towards the interior of the Whakakei, you pass the land known as Tuhirangi. The land along the river was very fertile and was used by Te Uri o Hau for many horticultural activities. Because of the fertility of the soil, Te Uri o Hau gifted some of this land to the Reverend William Gittos and his family as a show of friendship and so they would stay in the Kaipara area.

The mauri (life force) of the Whakakei River represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment posses a life force and all forms of life are related. Mauri is the critical element of the spiritual relationship of Te Uri o Hau with the Whakakei River.

## Schedule 10  
Statutory acknowledgement for Mangawhai Harbour coastal area

[s 75][92]

#### _Statutory area_

The area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies (**statutory area**) is the area known as the Mangawhai Harbour, as shown on SO Plan 70054\.

#### _Preamble_

Under [section 59][72] of Te Uri o Hau Claims Settlement Act 2002 (clause 5.2.3 of the deed of settlement), the Crown acknowledges the statement of Te Uri o Hau of the cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association of Te Uri o Hau with the Mangawhai Harbour as set out below.

#### _Cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association of Te Uri o Hau with the statutory area_

Te Uri o Hau have an important spiritual relationship with Mangawhai Harbour due to the many Wahi Tapu (sacred areas) sites in the area. Traditionally, prior to the battle of Te Ika a Ranganui, Te Uri o Hau gathered kaimoana (seafood) from the harbour. We also gathered materials for making tools for tattooing and cutting hair, flax fibres for use in certain types of weaving, and coastal grass species for tukutuku panels (woven panels) from the harbour and surrounding area.

There are many Te Uri o Hau traditional Nohoanga (temporary settlements) within the Mangawhai area, where we would camp to enable us to gather what we required. We would then travel back to our kainga (villages) beside the Kaipara Harbour. The Mangawhai Harbour is on the eastern rim of Te Uri o Hau's rohe and played a role as a major resource kete (food basket).

In 1825 the battle known as Te Ika Ranganui began in this area. A great many Te Uri o Hau people died during this battle. As a result of this battle, Te Uri o Hau consider that the area from and including the Mangawhai Harbour to Kaiwaka and beyond is tapu (sacred).

The mauri (life force) of the Mangawhai Harbour represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force and all forms of life are related. Mauri is the critical element of the spiritual relationship of Te Uri o Hau with the Mangawhai Harbour.

    Te Uri o Hau governance entity, and any activity carried on by Te Uri o Hau governance entity on the entitlement land, (including any work undertaken on the entitlement land under _clause 4.5_) is subject to all laws, bylaws, regulations, and land and water management practices relating to the entitlement land including the need, as required, to apply for resource consent under the [Resource Management Act 1991][209].
    
    4.8 Notification of activities
    
    In carrying out land and water management and practices relating to the entitlement land, the landholding agent must have regard to the existence of this Nohoanga entitlement and will notify Te Uri o Hau governance entity of any activity which may affect Te Uri o Hau governance entity, and will avoid unreasonable disruption to Te Uri o Hau governance entity.

## Schedule 13  
Statement by Te Uri o Hau of association with indigenous species

[s 102][124]

The whaikorero (oral history) of our tupuna from of old and now honoured by each generation thereafter places the utmost importance on the role of Te Uri o Hau as kaitiakitanga (guardians) for all the life forms of the environment. Te Uri o Hau have always believed that the environment, including all indigenous species of fish, flora, and fauna alive, is inter-related through whakapapa and all is precious to Te Uri o Hau. All species are important and all play their particular role within the environment. The integration of all species in the environment is woven within the holistic pattern of life itself. Te Uri o Hau as a people are part and parcel of the environment itself.

Te Uri o Hau recognise that any negative effects on one species may cause ill effects for other species. Te Uri o Hau continue to maintain a kaitiaki (guardian) role to look after all species within our environment.

The mauri (life force) of all species is important to Te Uri o Hau, the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All species of the natural environment possess a life force and all forms of life are related.
