*   #### Preamble
    
    *   (1) Te Runanga o Ngati Awa was constituted by Te Runanga o Ngati Awa Act 1988\. That Act declared Te Runanga o Ngati Awa to be a Maori Trust Board within the meaning and for the purposes of the [Maori Trust Boards Act 1955][20]. Te Runanga o Ngati Awa acts for and on behalf of nga uri o nga hapu o Ngati Awa, being the members of the Ngati Awa tribe in the Eastern Bay of Plenty:
    
    *   (2) On 27 March 2003, Ngati Awa entered into a deed of settlement with the Crown to settle all of its historical claims against the Crown under the [Treaty of Waitangi][21]:
    
    *   (3) It is a condition of the deed of settlement that a governance entity be established to receive and administer the settlement for and on behalf of Ngati Awa:
    
    *   (4) Discussions have occurred both within Ngati Awa and between Ngati Awa and the Crown in order to identify and agree on the nature of the governance entity to be established to receive and administer the settlement redress for and on behalf of Ngati Awa. Te Runanga o Ngati Awa, in its present role as a Maori Trust Board, is not regarded as suitable to undertake this function:
    
    *   (5) The Crown and Ngati Awa have agreed on the nature of the governance entity to be established to receive and administer the settlement. In establishing this entity, it is not thought desirable to abolish Te Runanga o Ngati Awa, but to make changes to its structure and the way it operates:
    
    *   (6) The members of Ngati Awa have, by postal ballot, agreed to the reconstitution of Te Runanga o Ngati Awa as proposed by this Act:
    
    *   (7) This Act is necessary to reconstitute Te Runanga o Ngati Awa and satisfy the condition in the deed of settlement for the establishment of a governance entity to receive and administer the settlement redress for and on behalf of Ngati Awa.

*   This is a reprint of Te Runanga o Ngati Awa Act 2005\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 25 March 2005, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that have yet to come into force or that contain relevant transitional or savings provisions are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order.

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][26] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/legislation/reprints.shtml or Part 8 of the _Tables of Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations, and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][27] and [17E][28] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
