    (2) In determining whether or not, or the extent to which, any act or omission will result, or will be likely to result, in competition in telecommunications markets for the long-term benefit of end-users of telecommunications services within New Zealand, the efficiencies that will result, or will be likely to result, from that act or omission must be considered.
    
    (2A) To avoid doubt, in determining whether or not, or the extent to which, competition in telecommunications markets for the long-term benefit of end-users of telecommunications services within New Zealand is promoted, consideration must be given to the incentives to innovate that exist for, and the risks faced by, investors in new telecommunications services that involve significant capital investment and that offer capabilities not available from established services.
    
    (3) Except as otherwise expressly provided, nothing in this Act limits the application of this section.
    
    (4) Subsection (3) is for the avoidance of doubt.

##### 22A Effect of application on existing agreement for supply of designated access service or specified service
    
*   (1) This section applies if an access seeker of a designated access service or specified service applies for a determination under [section 27][44] while an agreement is in force between that access seeker and the access provider of the service for the supply of that service or of any other service.

    *   (b) the access provider begins to supply the service on the terms specified in the determination.

##### 30A Overview of subpart
    
*   (1) This subpart enables the Commission to make, as an alternative to a determination made under [section 27][44], a determination of the terms on which a designated access service or specified service must be supplied with reference to all access seekers and all access providers of the service.
    
    (2) Accordingly, this subpart---
        
    *   (a) provides a process for the development of standard terms for the supply of the service ([sections 30C to 30J][53]):
    
    *   (b) provides for the Commission to make, and review, a standard terms determination ([sections 30K to 30R][63]):
    
    *   (c) specifies how a standard terms determination is to apply ([section 30S][73]):
    
    *   (d) clarifies the interface between a determination made under [section 27][44] and a standard terms determination ([section 30T][74]):
    
    *   (e) provides a mechanism that allows parties to a standard terms determination to apply for a residual terms determination if they wish to adjust, as between themselves, the application of terms specified in the standard terms determination ([sections 30U to 30ZD][76]).
    
    (3) This section is intended only as a guide to the general scheme and effect of this subpart.

##### 30B Interpretation
    
*   In this subpart,---
    
    _change in circumstances_, in relation to the price payable for a service, means any change in relevant circumstances since the last date on which that price was calculated (for example, any change to the terms of the service)
    
    _regulated terms_ means the terms set by any New Zealand or overseas regulator for any telecommunications service.

##### 30C When standard terms development process may be initiated
    
*   (1) The Commission may, on its own initiative, initiate the standard terms development process for a designated access service or specified service.
    
    (2) However, the Commission may not initiate that standard terms development process if the applicable conditions in relation to the service (if any) have not been met.
    
    (3) The Commission may investigate whether the applicable conditions in relation to the service have been met either---
        
    *   (a) before deciding to initiate the standard terms development process; or
    
    *   (b) at the time it prepares a standard terms determination under [section 30M][66].
    
    (4) However, if the Commission is satisfied, at any time, that the applicable conditions in relation to the service have not been met, the Commission must discontinue---
        
    *   (a) all of its investigation; or
    
    *   (b) as the case may be, that part of its investigation that relates to the market in which those conditions have not been met.
    
    (5) For the purposes of subsection (1), the Commission may, if it considers it appropriate in the circumstances, initiate a single combined standard terms development process for 2 or more designated access services or specified services.

    *   (b) any additional requirements for that proposal under [section 30F(2)][57].
    
    (3) A scoping workshop must be---

*   In this subpart, unless the context otherwise requires,---
    
    _equivalence_, in relation to the supply of a relevant regulated service, means equivalence of supply of the service and access to Chorus's network so that third-party access seekers are treated in the same way to Chorus's own business operations, including in relation to pricing, procedures, operational support, and supply of information and other relevant matters
    
    _legacy access network_ means the network comprising---
        
    *   (a) Chorus's local loop network, as defined in [clause 1][579] of Part 1 of Schedule 1 (including any relevant line in Chorus's local telephone exchange or distribution cabinet); and

    _non-discrimination_, in relation to the supply of a relevant service, means that Chorus must not treat access seekers differently or, where Chorus supplies itself with a relevant service, must not treat itself differently from other access seekers, except to the extent that a particular difference in treatment is objectively justifiable and does not harm, and is unlikely to harm, competition in any telecommunications market

    _relevant services_---
        
    *   (a) means---
            
        *   (i) wholesale telecommunications services that are provided using, or that provide access to the unbundled elements of, the legacy access network; and

    (2) The review must---
        
    *   (a) consider whether the existing regulatory framework under the [Telecommunications Act 2001][722] is the most effective means to---

        *   (ii) promote the legitimate commercial interests of access providers and access seekers; and

            *   (B) providing sufficient regulatory stability, transparency, and certainty to enable businesses to make long-term investments; and

    *   (b) assess whether alternative regulatory frameworks, including (without limitation) generic price control, would be a preferable and more effective means of achieving these outcomes.
    
    (3) In carrying out the review, the Minister must---
        
    *   (a) consult with interested parties, including the Commission, industry participants, consumers, and Māori; and

        *   (i) the extent of network coverage of services provided on fibre, copper, wireless, and other telecommunications networks; and
        
        *   (ii) the level of investment in fibre, copper, wireless, and other telecommunications networks, and the ability of access providers to recover that investment within a reasonable period; and

        *   (viii) developments in wireless solutions and whether they should be part of any telecommunications regulation; and
        
        *   (ix) experience in comparable jurisdictions and economic relations with Australia, weighed against what is appropriate for New Zealand conditions and the make-up and history of New Zealand's telecommunications markets; and
        
        *   (x) any other matters that the Minister considers relevant.

> 
> is the imputed retail price for the service. The imputed retail price must---
>     
> *   (a) be based on the observed discount of the bundle relative to the total price of the services offered separately; and
> 
> *   (b) take into account any price difference that arises from the lower cost of providing the services as a bundle, the lower cost of quantity supply, any difference in the cost of providing the services between different markets, and from any other difference in cost
> 
> 

**b**
> 
> is the discount off the imputed retail price for the service. The discount must be determined by using,---
>     
> *   (a) in the case of a non price-capped service offered by Telecom in markets in which Telecom faces limited, or is likely to face lessened, competition for that service, avoided costs saved pricing; or
> 
> *   (b) in the case of Telecom's price-capped residential access and calling service in which Telecom faces limited, or is likely to face lessened, competition for that service, actual costs saved pricing
> 
> 

**c**
