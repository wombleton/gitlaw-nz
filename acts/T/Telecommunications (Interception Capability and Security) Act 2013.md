*   The purpose of this Act in relation to network security is to prevent, sufficiently mitigate, or remove security risks arising from---
        
    *   (a) the design, build, or operation of public telecommunications networks; and
    
    *   (b) interconnections to or between public telecommunications networks in New Zealand or with networks overseas.
    
    

##### 8 Principles relating to network security
    
*   (1) The following principles must, as far as practicable, be applied by the Director and each network operator in relation to network security risks:
        
    *   (a) the principle that network security risks that might arise from a proposed decision, course of action, or change if implemented should be identified and addressed as early as possible:
    
    *   (b) the principle that the Director and each network operator should work co-operatively and collaboratively with each other in relation to the principle in paragraph (a).
    
    (2) The Director is subject to the principle that any decision or steps required of the Director for the purpose of exercising any function or power under [Part 3][59] should, in the absence of any applicable regulations, be made or taken as soon as practicable.
    
    (3) The Minister responsible for the Government Communications Security Bureau must, when making any decision or exercising any function or power under [Part 3][59] in relation to a network security risk, have regard to the principle in subsection (4).
    
    (4) The principle that the decision or exercise of the function or power should be proportionate to the network security risk.
    
    (5) In subsection (4), a decision or an exercise of a function or power is proportionate to the network security risk if the Minister is satisfied that it does not impose costs on network operators, customers, or end-users beyond those reasonably required to enable the network security risk to be prevented, sufficiently mitigated, or removed.

## Part 2  
Interception capability duties

### Subpart 1---Duty to have full interception capability

##### 9 Network operators must ensure public telecommunications networks and telecommunications services have full interception capability
    
*   (1) A network operator must ensure that every public telecommunications network that the operator owns, controls, or operates, and every telecommunications service that the operator provides in New Zealand, has full interception capability.
    
    (2) However, subsection (1)---
        
    *   (a) does not require a network operator to ensure that all components of the public telecommunications network or telecommunications service referred to in that subsection have full interception capability; and
    
    *   (b) is sufficiently complied with if a network operator ensures, in whatever manner the network operator thinks fit, that at least 1 component of that network or service has full interception capability.
    
    (3) Without limiting subsection (1), the duty under that subsection to have full interception capability includes the duty to ensure that the interception capability is developed, installed, and maintained.

##### 10 When duty to have full interception capability is complied with
    
*   (1) A public telecommunications network or a telecommunications service has full interception capability if every surveillance agency that is authorised under an interception warrant or any other lawful interception authority to intercept telecommunications or services on that network, or the network operator concerned, is able to---
        
    *   (a) identify and intercept telecommunications without intercepting telecommunications that are not authorised to be intercepted under the warrant or lawful authority; and
    
    *   (b) obtain call associated data relating to telecommunications (other than telecommunications that are not authorised to be intercepted under the warrant or lawful authority); and
    
    *   (c) obtain call associated data and the content of telecommunications (other than telecommunications that are not authorised to be intercepted under the warrant or lawful authority) in a useable format; and
    
    *   (d) carry out the interception of telecommunications unobtrusively, without unduly interfering with any telecommunications, and in a manner that protects the privacy of telecommunications that are not authorised to be intercepted under the warrant or lawful authority; and
    
    *   (e) undertake the actions referred to in paragraphs (a) to (d) efficiently and effectively and,---
            
        *   (i) if it is reasonably achievable, at the time of transmission of the telecommunication; or
        
        *   (ii) if it is not reasonably achievable, as close as practicable to that time.
        
        
    
    (2) If a network operator, or an employee or agent of a network operator, undertakes the interception of a telecommunication on behalf of a surveillance agency under subsection (1), the interception must be taken to be complete when the network operator provides the call associated data or the content of the telecommunication, or both, to the surveillance agency.
    
    (3) A network operator must, in order to comply with subsection (1)(c), decrypt a telecommunication on that operator's public telecommunications network or telecommunications service if---
        
    *   (a) the content of that telecommunication has been encrypted; and
    
    *   (b) the network operator intercepting the telecommunication has provided that encryption.
    
    (4) However, subsection (3) does not require a network operator to---
        
    *   (a) decrypt any telecommunication on that operator's public telecommunications network or telecommunications service if the encryption has been provided by means of a product that is---
            
        *   (i) supplied by a person other than the operator and is available to the public; or
        
        *   (ii) supplied by the operator as an agent for that product; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) ensure that a surveillance agency has the ability to decrypt any telecommunication.
    
    (5) In subsection (1)(c), _useable format_ means---
        
    *   (a) a format that is determined by a notice issued under [section 42][56]; or
    
    *   (b) a format that is acceptable to the network operator and the surveillance agency executing the interception warrant or other lawful interception authority.
