##### 8 Rating-powers
    
*   (1) The Trust is hereby empowered to make and levy the following rates:---
        
    *   (a) An administrative rate, over the whole of the rateable land in the district, to provide for the payment of general administrative charges that are of common interest to the district, but, pending a classification or classifications of the lands as herein provided, such rate may be made and levied on all the lands in the district.
    
    *   (b) Maintenance rates, over the rateable lands in any special area as defined herein, to provide for the cost of maintenance, repairs, and flood-damage to works carried out under this Act, and including the Taieri River, Waipori River and Lake embankments at present existing.
    
    *   (c) A drainage rate, over all the rateable land on the western side of the Taieri River, to provide for the maintenance of any work or works constructed or maintained by the Western Taieri Land Drainage Board or any other extension or improvement of such work or works, but excluding the embankments mentioned in the last preceding paragraph.
    
    *   (d) An embankment rate to provide for the maintenance and repair of the existing river-embankments and lake-embankments; but before making any such rate the Trust shall cause all the land in the district to be classified into two classes, namely:---
            
        *   (i) Lands receiving a benefit from the embankments so as to be maintained and repaired, and such lands shall be rateable; and
        
        *   (ii) All other lands; such lands shall not be rateable.
        
        
    
    (2) Before making and levying a drainage rate as provided in paragraph [(c)][8] of the preceding subsection the Trust shall cause the land to be classified into two classes, namely: (a) Lands receiving a benefit from the maintenance or improvement of such work or works, which land shall be rateable; and (b) all other lands, which shall be non-rateable.
    
    (3) The administrative, maintenance, embankment and drainage rates shall be uniform and be made and levied on an acreage basis.
    
    (4) For the purpose of providing the interest and other charges on any loan or loans authorized by the ratepayers to be raised for any work or works the Trust shall, by resolution which shall be published in the _Gazette_, describe the boundaries of the area to be benefited by such work or works, and shall declare the area so described to be a special area, and shall cause to be made a classification of the benefits to be derived by each property within such special area. In such classification there shall be specified the amount to be paid by the owner or occupier of each property, and such amount shall be deemed to be a special annual-recurring rate within the meaning of the Local Authorities Loans Act 1956, and shall be payable at such intervals as the Trust by resolution determines, and shall be levied year by year without further proceeding by the Trust until the loan in respect of which the classification is made is fully paid off. Such rates on each property shall be made in the ratio of the individual benefit to the total estimated benefits in such special area. After adoption by the Trust and before entering upon any scheme of improvement in or for the benefit of any district as defined in this subsection the lands shall be classified as herein provided.
    
    (5) Every classification shall be dealt with by the Trust, and every person who thinks himself aggrieved thereby may appeal against the same in the manner provided by the [River Boards Act 1908][30].
    
    (6) All appeals against any classification shall be decided by a District Court Judge sitting with two assessors, one of whom shall be appointed by the Trust and the other by the Minister of Public Works.
    
    (7) Every classification list, when signed by the Trust in case there is no appeal, and when signed by the District Court Judge and assessors after any appeal, shall for the purpose of any proceedings for the recovery of rates payable under this Act be conclusive evidence of the liability of the owner or occupier for the time being of the property described therein; and every such list shall remain in force until another is made under the provisions of this Act.
    
    (8) The Trust shall cause separate accounts to be kept for all administrative, maintenance, embankment drainage, and special rates made and levied.
    
    (9) After all classifications have been completed all the moneys paid as administrative rates in respect of lands classified as land not receiving any benefit shall be refunded.
    
    (10) With respect to that part of the district which lies on the east side of the river between the Allanton Bridge and the steel traffic-bridge at Henley the following provisions shall apply:---
        
    *   (a) The lands therein shall be exempt from rating under this Act.
    
    *   (b) The Trust shall have the control of the river and the power to remove from the river-bed all willows and other obstructions.

    *   (d) Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to interfere with the right of the owners of such lands to access to the river or the use of the waters thereof.
