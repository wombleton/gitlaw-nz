An Act to exempt certain lands and buildings for the time being vested in and used by The New Zealand Institute for the Blind for the care and assistance of blind persons situated in the City of Auckland from the liability for payment of certain rates, and to authorise the Auckland City Council to remit certain rates heretofore charged or levied against The New Zealand Institute for the Blind in respect of such said lands and buildings
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    Whereas The New Zealand Institute for the Blind (hereinafter called the _Institute_), a separate institution under the Hospitals and Charitable Institutions Act 1926, owns and conducts an institution in the City of Auckland for the care and assistance of blind persons:
    
    And whereas it has heretofore been doubtful whether the lands and buildings used for such purposes were exempt from rating and the Institute has not been paying rates thereon save only rates levied or charged in connection with water supplied by the Auckland City Council (hereinafter called the _Council_) for and in respect of the said lands and buildings:
    
    And whereas the Council has now been advised that the said lands and buildings are rateable and it is desirable to expressly exempt the said lands and buildings from all rates (save only rates levied or charged in connection with water supplied to the Institute for or in respect of the said lands and buildings) and to make such exemption retrospective.

##### 1 Short Title
    
*   This Act may be cited as The New Zealand Institute for the Blind Rating Exemption Act 1935\.

##### 2 Exemption of certain properties of The New Zealand Institute for the Blind from the payment of rates
    
*   (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Rating Act 1925 or any other Act, all lands and buildings situated in the City of Auckland for the time being vested in and actually used by the Institute for the purposes of any school, workroom, shop, gardens, recreation grounds, residences, or residential quarters for blind persons and held otherwise than as an endowment shall be deemed not to be and never to have been rateable property for the purposes of the Rating Act 1925, and in respect thereof the Institute shall be exempt from liability for the payment of rates not being rates charged or levied for or in respect of water supplied by the Council in respect of such said lands and buildings as if the said lands and buildings had always been excluded from the definition of rateable property in the Rating Act 1925\.
    
    (2) The Council is hereby authorised to remit or write off all rates (not being rates charged or levied for or in respect of water supplied by the Council) heretofore charged or levied against the Institute in respect of the lands and buildings to which this section applies.

##### 3 Private Act
    
*   This Act is hereby declared to be a private Act.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of The New Zealand Institute for the Blind Rating Exemption Act 1935\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 26 October 1935, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][6] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][7] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][8] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][9] and [17E][10] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
