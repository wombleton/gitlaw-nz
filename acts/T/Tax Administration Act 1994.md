*   (1) This section sets out the notice requirements for a multi-rate PIE in relation to its investors or a proxy for investors in a multi-rate PIE. The notices must contain the information that the Commissioner considers relevant for a calculation period.
    
    (2) For an exiting investor and a PIE that calculates and pays tax using the quarterly calculation option under [section HM 43][1097] of the Income Tax Act 2007, the notice must be provided for each calculation period in which the exit period falls. The notice must be given by the end of the month following the quarter in which the exit period ends.

    *   (a) by 31 May after the end of the tax year, if the PIE is not a superannuation fund or retirement savings scheme and has an income year ending before 31 May; or

*   (1) This section applies when a person's application for an RWT exemption certificate is based on their meeting the requirements in [section 32E(2)(j)][122].
    
    (2) The person must provide evidence to satisfy the Commissioner of their annual gross income for the accounting year. They must provide the evidence within the 3-month period after the end of the accounting year.
    
    (3) For the purposes of subsection (2), the Commissioner may require further evidence, and also for the purposes of [section 32L][129].
    
    (4) If the person's annual gross income for the tax year referred to in [section 32E(2)(j)][122] is less than $2,000,000, they are liable for late payment penalties in relation to an amount received or derived by them that would have been withheld under the RWT rules, had they not held an RWT exemption certificate. [Section 139B][545] applies to the person as if---
        
    *   (a) they had failed to withhold an amount of tax; and
    
    *   (b) the default occurred on each day on which they received or derived a payment from which RWT would otherwise have been withheld.
    
    (5) In the calculation of estimated annual gross income of a company that anticipates that it will be part of a group of companies for the tax year referred to in [section 32E(2)(j)][122], the estimated annual gross income of all other group companies is included.
    
    (6) Despite subsection (5), in the calculation of the annual gross income of a company for the purposes of this section, an amount of income derived by them or another company in the same group of companies from a transaction or series of related or connected transactions with another company in the group is excluded.
    
    (7) Despite subsections (2) and (4), the Commissioner may provide an RWT exemption certificate to, or allow it to be retained by, a person who does not meet the requirements of [section 32E(2)(j)][122] if the Commissioner considers that the failure is solely a consequence of extraordinary circumstances that are---
        
    *   (a) beyond the person's reasonable control; and
    
    *   (b) unlikely to be repeated in later accounting years.
    
    (8) For the purposes of subsection (6), the Commissioner may remit some or all of a late payment penalty if the Commissioner considers that the failure is solely a consequence of extraordinary circumstances that the person could not reasonably be expected to have foreseen.

    (2) The Commissioner may make a private ruling on how a taxation law applies to the arrangement described in an application whether or not reference was made to that taxation law in the application.
    
    (3) The Commissioner may decline to make a private ruling if---
        
    *   (a) the Commissioner considers that the correctness of the ruling would depend on which assumptions were made about a future event or other matter; or
    
    *   (b) the arrangement on which the ruling is sought, or a separately identifiable part of that arrangement, is substantially the same as an arrangement which is subject to an objection, challenge, or appeal, whether in relation to the applicant or any other person; or
    
    *   (c) the applicant has outstanding debts relating to earlier binding ruling applications.
    
    (3B) Despite subsection (1), the Commissioner may decide to not make a private ruling, to the extent to which it would be a ruling on how [section GA 1][1683] of the Income Tax Act 2007 applies or would apply.
    
    (4) The Commissioner may not make a private ruling if---
        
    *   (a) the application for the ruling would require the Commissioner to determine a proscribed question; or
    
    *   (b) at the time the application is made or at any time before the ruling is issued, the Commissioner considers that the person to whom the ruling is to apply is not seriously contemplating the arrangement for which the ruling is sought; or

    *   (d) the matter on which the ruling is sought---

        *   (ii) is being dealt with, or in the Commissioner's opinion should be dealt with, by one or both competent authorities of the parties to a double tax agreement; or
        
        
    
    *   (e) a private ruling already exists on how the relevant taxation law applies to the person and the arrangement, and the proposed ruling would apply to a period or a tax year to which the existing ruling applies; or
    
    *   (f) an assessment relating to the person, the arrangement, and a period or a tax year to which the proposed ruling would apply has been made, unless the application is received by the Commissioner before the date an assessment is made; or
    
    *   (g) the Commissioner is auditing or investigating how the taxation law applies to the person and to the arrangement for a period or a tax year to which the proposed ruling would apply; or

    *   (h) in the Commissioner's opinion the applicant has not provided sufficient information in relation to the application after the Commissioner has requested further information; or
    
    *   (i) in the Commissioner's opinion it would be unreasonable to make a ruling in view of the resources available to the Commissioner; or
    
    *   (j) the application for the ruling would require the Commissioner to form an opinion as to a generally accepted accounting practice.
    
    (4A) Subsection (4)(a) does not apply if the application for the ruling relates to how either [sections GC 6 to GC 14][1684] or [YD 5][1685] of the Income Tax Act 2007 applies, or would apply, to the person applying for the ruling and to the arrangement, whether a single or a recurring arrangement, for which the ruling is sought.
    
    (5) The Commissioner may not, before 1 April 1996 or such other date as may be specified by the Governor-General by Order in Council for the purposes of this subsection, make a private ruling on an arrangement if that arrangement was entered into before the date on which the Commissioner received the application for the ruling.

    *   (f) in the Commissioner's opinion the applicant has not provided sufficient information in relation to the application after the Commissioner has requested further information; or
    
    *   (g) in the Commissioner's opinion it would be unreasonable to make a ruling in view of the resources available to the Commissioner; or

    ###### Example
    
    ###### Section 120KD
    
    Mr Yellow, who has a March balance date, decides to change to a May balance date. The transitional year is 14 months long. He starts business on 31 July, estimating provisional tax at $15,000 for the income year. At the end of the year, Mr Yellow's residual income tax is $20,000\. He is not subject to GST.
    
    ![. ](images/TaxS120KC.jpg)
    
    Instalments in transitional year: 28th day of 5th, 9th, and 13th months after balance date, and final instalment on 28th day of month following final month in transitional year (s MB 20(2) and Schedule 13, Part B Income Tax Act 2004). But first business day falls within 30 days of the date that would be the first instalment, 28 August (s MB 20(4)(a) of that Act), so no instalment is due. The April instalment only is due on 7 May.
    
    Amounts payable on the instalment dates are calculated under s MB 22 of that Act.
        
    *   First instalment due 15 January: $15,000 × 4/14 = $4,285
    
    *   Second instalment due 7 May: $15,000 × 8/14 − $4,285 = $4,286
    
    *   Final instalment due 28 June: $15,000 − $8,571 = $6,429\.

##### 120KD Provisional tax instalments in transitional years
    
*   (1) For a transitional year to which [Schedule 3][1194], Part B of the Income Tax Act 2007 applies, the residual income tax of a provisional taxpayer, other than a person to whom [section 120KE(1) or (3)][479] applies, is due and payable as determined under [sections RC 21 to RC 24][1195] of the Income Tax Act 2007\.
    
    (2) A provisional taxpayer in a transitional year is liable for use of money interest for unpaid tax in relation to the instalments of provisional tax payable in the months set out in [Schedule 3][1194], Part B of the Income Tax Act 2007\. The date interest starts is the day after the day on which payment of the instalment is due under [section RC 21][1195] of that Act.
    
    (3) For the purposes of calculating the amount of interest due in relation to an instalment of provisional tax other than a final instalment, the amount of residual income tax payable on the instalment date is calculated using the formula---
    
    ![. ](images/TaxS120KDg1.jpg)
    
    (4) In the formula, the _instalment period_ is either---
        
    *   (a) 4, for provisional taxpayers who pay on the equivalent of instalment dates B, D, and F; or
    
    *   (b) 6, for provisional taxpayers who pay on the equivalent of instalment dates C and F.
    
    (5) For the purposes of calculating the amount of interest due in relation to a final instalment of provisional tax, the amount of residual income tax payable is the residual income tax for the tax year minus any amount treated as due on an instalment date referred to in subsection (3).
    
    (6) In this section, a _provisional taxpayer_ includes a new provisional taxpayer.
    
    ###### Example
    
    ###### Section 120KE
    
    Dr Beige starts the income year (March balance date) using a GST ratio to determine the amount of provisional tax payable. He makes payments in June and August. On 10 September 2007, Dr Beige decides to change his determination method. He must then estimate his residual income tax for the income year (s MB 17(5) Income Tax Act 2004), and pay 2 instalments under the estimation method on instalment dates D and F (s MB 6(5) of that Act). Dr Beige provides a return for the income year that shows residual income tax of $30,000\.
    
    Four interest start dates apply:
        
    *   for credit interest, the interest start date is 11 September 2007 (s 120KE(6)):

    *   (b) any extended time for objection previously allowed by the Commissioner in respect of the assessment:

    (2) No notice of objection given after the time specified in the notice of assessment, or after such extended time as the Commissioner may allow under subsection (1), shall be of any force or effect unless the Commissioner accepts the same and gives notice to the objector accordingly.

    (6) If the competent objection or challenge relates to the 1996--97 or an earlier tax year, interest must be calculated on deferrable tax on and after the date that the period of deferral starts.

##### 136 When objection may be referred directly to High Court

    *   (a) an objection to an assessment is made in accordance with [section 126(1)][504] or accepted by the Commissioner under section 126(2); and
    
    *   (b) the objection is not wholly allowed by the Commissioner; and
    
    *   (c) the objection is one to which subsection (2) or subsection (3) applies,---
    
    the objection may be referred directly to the High Court by way of case stated in accordance with this section.

    *   (a) the objector may, within 2 months after the date on which notice of the disallowance is given to the objector by or on behalf of the Commissioner, by notice to the Commissioner require the Commissioner to state a case for the opinion of the High Court, and shall specify in the notice the registry of that court in which the objector requires the case to be filed:
    
    *   (b) the Commissioner, in any case where under [section 134][514] the objector has required the objection to be heard and determined by a Taxation Review Authority, may, instead of referring the objection to a Taxation Review Authority, state a case for the opinion of the High Court, and shall notify the objector accordingly.

    *   (a) the objector may, within 2 months after the date on which notice of the disallowance is given to the objector by or on behalf of the Commissioner, give notice to the Commissioner that the objector desires the Commissioner to state a case for the opinion of the High Court, specifying in the notice the registry of that court in which the objector desires the case to be filed:

    (5) Within 3 months after---

    (8) If the objector fails to serve on the Commissioner the points of objection within the period referred to in subsection (5), or within such further period as may be allowed under subsection (12), the objection shall be deemed to be withdrawn and the Commissioner shall not be required to take any further steps in relation to the objection.
    
    (9) Where under this section an objection is to be referred directly to the High Court, the Commissioner shall, within 3 months after the date of service of the points of objection or within such further period as may be allowed under subsection (12), state and sign a case which shall comprise---

        *   (ii) the issues which the Commissioner claims require to be determined by the court.
        
        
    
    (10) The case so stated and signed, together with one copy, shall be filed by the Commissioner---
        
    *   (a) in the registry of the High Court specified by the objector in the notice under subsection (2)(a) or subsection (3)(a), where such a notice has been given by the objector; or
    
    *   (b) in such registry of the High Court as the Commissioner thinks fit in any other case, having due regard to the convenience of the objector.
    
    (11) A copy of the case so filed shall be served by the Commissioner on the objector either personally or by sending it to the objector by registered post addressed to the objector at the address for service specified by the objector in the points of objection, or at such other address as the objector has given notice of to the Commissioner for the purpose, and the copy so sent by registered post shall be deemed to have been received when in the ordinary course of post it would be delivered.

    (13) Where the Commissioner fails to file a case within the time specified in subsection (9), or within such further time as may be allowed under subsection (12), the objector may apply to the High Court for an order directing the Commissioner to allow the objector's objection, and the High Court---
        
    *   (a) shall make such an order accordingly, unless it is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for the failure to file the case:
    
    *   (b) may, where it refuses to make such an order, make such other orders as in the circumstances it thinks fit, whether relating to the filing of the case in the High Court, the remitting of the objection to a Taxation Review Authority for hearing and determination, or otherwise.
    
    (14) The contents of the case shall not be conclusive as to the matters set forth in it either against the objector or the Commissioner, except so far as agreed to in writing by or on behalf of the objector and the Commissioner.

Subject to those provisions, the procedure at the hearing before the High Court of any such case stated shall be the same, with any necessary modifications, as if the case were a proceeding in which the objector is the plaintiff and the Commissioner is the defendant.
    
    (17) On hearing any case stated under this section, the High Court may---

    *   (b) make any assessment which the Commissioner was empowered to make at the time the Commissioner made the assessment to which the objection relates, or direct the Commissioner to make such an assessment, in which case an assessment shall be made by the Commissioner so as to conform to that direction.

    provided that no such fresh determination shall be made by the Commissioner before the resolution of the appeal procedures.
    
    (19) The time bar shall not apply with respect to---
        
    *   (a) any determination of the court under subsection (17)(a) or any amendment made by the Commissioner to an assessment for the purpose of conforming to any such determination; or

    *   (b) if on any such application the High Court refuses to grant such leave,---

    (3) The Commissioner may in relation to any objection, at any time after the objection has been lodged and before it has been determined by a Taxation Review Authority or the High Court, give notice to the objector that the objection will be stayed by reason of the taking of a test case on a similar objection or challenge before the High Court, if the Commissioner considers that the test case is likely to be determinative of all or a substantial number of the issues in the objection proposed to be stayed.
    
    (4) Subject to subsection (9), the notice by the Commissioner referred to in subsection (3) shall have the effect of staying the objection pending the determination of the test case.

        *   (ii) should have been given in relation to the default referred to in paragraph (b).
        
        
    
    (5C) If the taxpayer enters into an instalment arrangement for the default under [section 177B][684] and a late payment penalty is imposed under [section 139BA(1)][546], the taxpayer is treated for the purposes of this section as paying on time, to the extent of the default, the amount of tax due for payment.

##### 141 Tax shortfalls
    
*   (1) Tax shortfalls are to be calculated by the Commissioner in accordance with this section.
    
    (2) A tax shortfall calculation is required each time a taxpayer is liable to pay a shortfall penalty, subject to [section 141AA(1)][558].
    
    (3) A separate tax shortfall calculation is required---
        
    *   (a) for each return period; and
    
    *   (b) for each tax type; and
    
    *   (c) for each tax position taken by a taxpayer.
    
    (4) Each tax deemed to be another tax is a separate tax type.
    
    (5) If, in a return period---
        
    *   (a) a taxpayer is liable to pay 1 or more shortfall penalties in respect of the same tax type; and
    
    *   (b) the taxpayer's liability to the tax is overstated in 1 or more respects---

    *   (d) setting off the tax effects of the overstatements prorated against the understatements, in the case of more than 1 tax shortfall.
    
    (6) If---
        
    *   (a) a taxpayer's tax position in respect of a tax type (in this subsection referred to as _tax one_) in a return period is adjusted by the Commissioner, and the tax effect of the adjustment is a tax shortfall; and
    
    *   (b) as a result or consequence of the adjustment, the Commissioner also adjusts the taxpayer's tax position in respect of another type of tax (in this subsection referred to as _tax two_) in the same return period, and the tax effect of the further adjustment is an entitlement to a refund or to an increased refund of tax,---
    
    the Commissioner may, for the purpose of imposing a penalty, treat an amount up to the refund, or increased refund, of tax two as though it were tax one paid by the taxpayer in the return period, and in so doing reduce the tax shortfall for tax one.
    
    (7) If---
        
    *   (a) a taxpayer's tax position in respect of a tax type in a return period is adjusted by the Commissioner, and the tax effect of the adjustment is a tax shortfall; and
    
    *   (b) linked to the adjustment, the Commissioner adjusts another taxpayer's tax position in respect of the same tax type in the same return period, and the tax effect of the further adjustment is an entitlement to a refund or an increased refund of tax or a reduction in tax to pay; and
    
    *   (c) the 2 taxpayers are associated persons,---
    
    the Commissioner may, for the purpose of imposing a penalty, treat an amount up to the refund, or increased refund, or reduction, of tax as though it were tax paid by the taxpayer referred to in paragraph (a) in the return period, and in so doing reduce that taxpayer's tax shortfall.
    
    (7B) The Commissioner may exercise the discretion under subsection (7) in relation to a taxpayer and an associated person having a different return period if---
        
    *   (a) subsection (7) would apply to the taxpayer in the absence of this subsection if the associated person's return period were the same as the taxpayer's return period; and
    
    *   (b) the taxpayer's return period affected by the adjustment referred to in subsection (7)(a) overlaps the associated person's return period affected by the adjustment referred to in subsection (7)(b); and
    
    *   (c) the taxpayer's tax position is not an abusive tax position and does not involve evasion or a similar act.
    
    (7C) Subsection (7D) applies if---
        
    *   (a) the Commissioner makes an adjustment to a taxpayer's tax position (_taxpayer A_) for a tax credit under [section LH 2][995] of the Income Tax Act 2007 relating to internal software development as that term is defined in [section LH 17][1995] of that Act; and
    
    *   (b) the adjustment described in paragraph (a) results in a tax shortfall; and
    
    *   (c) the Commissioner makes an adjustment to another taxpayer's tax position (_taxpayer B_) for a tax credit under [section LH 2][995] of that Act relating to internal software development as defined in [section LH 17][1995] of that Act; and
    
    *   (d) the adjustment described in paragraph (c) is for the same tax year as the adjustment described in paragraph (a); and
    
    *   (e) for taxpayer B, an entitlement to an amount of refund or increased refund of tax (the _refund amount_) results from the adjustment described in paragraph (c); and
    
    *   (f) for the period to which the adjustments described in paragraphs (a) and (c) relate, taxpayer A and taxpayer B are members of the same internal software development group, as that term is defined in [section LH 17][1995] of that Act; and
    
    *   (g) the tax credits described in paragraphs (a) and (c) relate to expenditure or depreciation loss under [subpart LH][1996] incurred while taxpayer A and taxpayer B are members of the same internal software development group, as that term is defined in [section LH 17][1995] of that Act.
    
    (7D) If this subsection applies because of subsection (7C), then, for the purposes of imposing a penalty, the Commissioner may treat an amount that is less than or equal to taxpayer B's refund amount, described in subsection (7C)(e), as an amount of tax paid by taxpayer A. Treating the amount as tax paid by taxpayer A for the purposes of imposing a penalty reduces taxpayer A's shortfall.
    
    (8) The Commissioner may treat the companies in a wholly-owned group as if they were a single taxpayer for the purposes of determining a tax shortfall.
    
    (9) If, in the application of subsection (6), 2 types of tax have different return periods, the Commissioner may, for the purpose of determining a tax shortfall, specify that part of 1 or more return periods for one of the tax types is to be treated as the same return period for the other tax type.
    
    (10) If---
        
    *   (a) in a return period, a taxpayer takes a taxpayer's tax position---
            
        *   (i) in respect of, or as a consequence of entering into, an arrangement; or
        
        *   (ii) in respect of an article, item, or matter; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) in the same return period, the taxpayer takes a similar or identical taxpayer's tax position---
            
        *   (i) in respect of, or as a consequence of entering into, a similar or identical arrangement; or
        
        *   (ii) in respect of a similar or identical article, item, or matter,---
        
        
    
    the tax shortfalls arising from the taxpayer's tax positions are to be aggregated and deemed to be 1 tax shortfall.
    
    (11) \[Repealed\]
    
    (12) The tax effect of a tax position taken by a taxpayer in a return period is to be calculated having regard to---
        
    *   (a) the marginal rate or rates of tax applicable to the taxpayer during the return period; and
    
    *   (b) where the taxpayer has no tax to pay in the return period, the rate of tax or lowest marginal rate of tax that would apply to the taxpayer during the return period, if the taxpayer had tax to pay.
    
    (12A) Where a life insurer derives policyholder income in a tax year and the life insurer's tax position in respect of the policyholder base income tax liability gives rise to a tax shortfall, the Commissioner shall not assess under [sections 141A to 141EB][559] a penalty on the proportion of the tax shortfall that is attributable to the life insurer's tax position in respect of the amount of underwriting income represented by underwriting result in the formula in [section EY 43(1)][1997] of the Income Tax Act 2007\.
    
    (13) In this section, _tax_ does not include a civil penalty.
    
    (14) For the purposes of determining the amount of a tax shortfall in relation to an instalment date and a provisional taxpayer, the tax shortfall shall be the difference between---
        
    *   (a) the lesser of---
            
        *   (i) the amount of provisional tax payable on the instalment date if an estimate had not applied at that instalment date; and
        
        *   (ii) the amount that would have been payable on that instalment date if the taxpayer's provisional tax payable for the tax year had been the taxpayer's residual income tax liability for the tax year; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) the amount of provisional tax payable on that instalment date as determined by the estimate applying as at that instalment date.

    (10) In any specified proceedings, the following provisions of this subsection shall apply for the purposes of [section 5][2089] of the Evidence Amendment Act 1952 (which relates to proof of photographic copies of documents), namely:

    (13) Subsections (9) and (10), and also subsection (8) where an affidavit has been filed, shall, with the necessary modifications, apply with respect to the hearing of an application under subsection (12) as if it were the hearing of the charge for the offence and as if the record or copy or entry had been tendered in evidence.

    (15) For the purposes of this section, where it appears to the court that a record or a copy of a record is part of the records kept or held in relation to a business, the court may infer that the record or copy and entries in the record or copy were made in the regular course of business by a person in carrying on that business.

    (2) The right of the Commissioner to recover from the employer the amount in respect of which default has been made shall be in addition to any right of the Commissioner to recover that amount from the employee under the PAYE rules; and nothing in those rules shall be construed as preventing the Commissioner from taking such steps as the Commissioner thinks fit to recover that amount from the employer and from the employee concurrently, or from recovering that amount wholly from the employer or from the employee or partly from the employer and partly from the employee.

    (1B) This section applies to a person instead of an employer if the person is acting as a PAYE intermediary for the employer in relation to an employee and a pay period, and the employer, for the pay period, has---
        
    *   (a) paid to the person the salary or wages relating to the employee as required by [sections RP 9 to RP 11][1874] of the Income Tax Act 2007:

Notwithstanding anything in any other Act, if any property subject to the charge created by this section is also subject to a charge created by that other Act, the charges shall rank equally with each other unless by virtue of that Act the charge so created would be deferred to the charge created by this section.
    
    (3) Despite [section 23(b)][2137] of the Personal Property Securities Act 1999, if a charge affects property of a particular kind and the provisions of a registration Act applicable to the property provide for the registration of charges or security interests over property of that kind, the Commissioner may have particulars of that charge recorded on the register without payment of any fee.
    
    (4) Particulars recorded under subsection (3) are to operate and take priority according to the provisions of the applicable registration Act.
    
    (4B) If a mortgage that affects the same property is registered before the registration of the charge under this section and money secured by the mortgage is advanced after the registration of the charge under this section, the charge has priority over the mortgage in respect of that money.
    
    (5) On the satisfaction of a registered charge, the Commissioner must release the charge in the manner required by the Act under which it was registered, with such modifications as may be necessary, and without being required to pay a fee.
    
    (6) Any charge created by this section which is registered against any property shall operate to secure any amount secured by any prior unregistered charge and unpaid at the time of the registration of the charge, and also to secure any amount secured by any charge coming into existence after the registration of the charge, to the intent that the registered charge shall operate to secure the total of all amounts for the time being owing by the employer under all charges created by this section.
    
    (7) If any amount constitutes by virtue of this section a charge on any property the High Court may make such order as it thinks fit, either for the sale of that property or any part of that property, or for the appointment of a receiver of the rents, profits, or income of that property, and for the payment of the amount of the charge and the costs of the Commissioner out of the proceeds of the sale or out of the rents, profits, or income.
    
    (8) Where any property has been sold under any such order, the High Court may, on the application of the purchaser or the Commissioner, make an order vesting the property in the purchaser.
    
    (9) Every such vesting order shall have the same effect as if all persons entitled to the property had been free from all disability and had duly executed all proper conveyances, transfers, and assignments of the property for such estate or interest as is specified in the order, and in the case of land which is subject to the [Land Transfer Act 1952][2138] the purchaser's title to that land shall be registered accordingly.
    
    (10) This section shall apply subject to [section 167][642].
