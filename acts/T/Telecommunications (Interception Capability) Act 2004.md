*   This Act binds the Crown.

#### Purpose and principles

##### 5 Purpose
    
*   The purpose of this Act is to ensure---
        
    *   (a) that surveillance agencies are able to effectively carry out the lawful interception of telecommunications under an interception warrant or any other lawful interception authority; and
    
    *   (b) that surveillance agencies, in obtaining assistance for the interception of telecommunications, do not create barriers to the introduction of new or innovative telecommunications technologies; and
    
    *   (c) that network operators and service providers have the freedom to choose system design features and specifications that are appropriate for their own purposes.
    
    

##### 6 Principles
    
*   The following principles must be applied by persons who exercise powers and carry out duties under this Act if those principles are relevant to those powers or duties:
        
    *   (a) the principle that the privacy of telecommunications that are not subject to an interception warrant or any other lawful interception authority must be maintained to the extent provided for in law:
    
    *   (b) the principle that the interception of telecommunications, when authorised under an interception warrant or any other lawful interception authority, must be carried out without unduly interfering with any telecommunications.
    
    

## Part 2  
Interception duties

#### Duty to have interception capability

##### 7 Network operators must ensure public telecommunications networks and telecommunications services have interception capability
    
*   (1) A network operator must ensure that every public telecommunications network that the operator owns, controls, or operates, and every telecommunications service that the operator provides in New Zealand, has an interception capability.
    
    (2) However, subsection (1)---
        
    *   (a) does not require a network operator to ensure that all components of the public telecommunications network or telecommunications service referred to in that subsection have an interception capability; and
    
    *   (b) is sufficiently complied with if a network operator ensures, in whatever manner the network operator thinks fit, that at least 1 component of that network or service has an interception capability.
    
    (3) Without limiting subsection (1), the duty under that subsection to have an interception capability includes the duty to ensure that the interception capability is developed, installed, and maintained.

##### 8 When duty to have interception capability is complied with
    
*   (1) A public telecommunications network or a telecommunications service has an interception capability if every surveillance agency that is authorised under an interception warrant or any other lawful interception authority to intercept telecommunications or services on that network, or the network operator concerned, is able to---
        
    *   (a) identify and intercept telecommunications without intercepting telecommunications that are not authorised to be intercepted under the warrant or authority; and
    
    *   (b) obtain call associated data relating to telecommunications (other than telecommunications that are not authorised to be intercepted under the warrant or authority); and
    
    *   (c) obtain call associated data and the content of telecommunications (other than telecommunications that are not authorised to be intercepted under the warrant or authority) in a format that is able to be used by the agency; and
    
    *   (d) carry out the interception of telecommunications unobtrusively, without unduly interfering with any telecommunications, and in a manner that protects the privacy of telecommunications that are not authorised to be intercepted under the warrant or authority; and
    
    *   (e) undertake the actions referred to in paragraphs (a) to (d) efficiently and effectively and,---
            
        *   (i) if it is reasonably achievable, at the time of transmission of the telecommunication; or
        
        *   (ii) if it is not reasonably achievable, as close as practicable to that time.
        
        
    
    (2) If a network operator, or an employee or agent of a network operator, undertakes the interception of a telecommunication on behalf of a surveillance agency under subsection (1), the interception must be taken to be complete when the network operator provides the call associated data or the content of the telecommunication, or both, to the surveillance agency.
    
    (3) A network operator must, in order to comply with subsection (l)(c), decrypt a telecommunication on that operator's public telecommunications network or telecommunications service if---
        
    *   (a) the content of that telecommunication has been encrypted; and
    
    *   (b) the network operator intercepting the telecommunication has provided that encryption.
    
    (4) However, subsection (3) does not require a network operator to---
        
    *   (a) decrypt any telecommunication on that operator's public telecommunications network or telecommunications service if the encryption has been provided by means of a product that is---
            
        *   (i) supplied by a person other than the operator and is available on retail sale to the public; or
        
        *   (ii) supplied by the operator as an agent for that product; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) ensure that a surveillance agency has the ability to decrypt any telecommunication.
    
    

#### Limits on duty to have interception capability

##### 9 Certain facilities excluded from scope of duty under section 7
    
*   Despite [section 7][12], a network operator is not required to have an interception capability on a telecommunication link that is used to interconnect 2 or more public telecommunications networks.

##### 10 Design of networks not affected by this Act
    
*   This Act does not authorise a surveillance agency to---
        
    *   (a) require any person to adopt a specific design or feature for any network; or
    
    *   (b) prohibit any person from adopting any specific design or feature for any network.
    
    

#### Exemptions

##### 11 Minister may grant exemptions
    
*   (1) The Minister may exempt any network operator from the requirements of [section 7][12] or from the requirements of all or any of the provisions of [section 8][13] (except [section 8(1)(a) and (d)][13]) if the Minister considers that there are special circumstances (for example, a pilot trial of a new network or telecommunications service) that justify granting an exemption.
    
    (2) The Minister may grant the exemption---
        
    *   (a) unconditionally; or
    
    *   (b) subject to any conditions the Minister thinks fit.
    
    (3) The exemption---
        
    *   (a) must be granted for a period of time that the Minister specifies; and
    
    *   (b) may, at any time, be varied or revoked by the Minister.
    
    

##### 12 Minister must consult responsible Ministers before granting exemption
    
*   (1) Before granting, varying, or revoking an exemption under [section 11][18], the Minister must consult with the responsible Ministers.
    
    (2) A failure to comply with subsection (1) does not affect the validity of any exemption granted under [section 11][18].

#### Duty to assist

##### 13 Duty to assist surveillance agencies
    
*   (1) A surveillance agency to whom an interception warrant is issued, or any other lawful interception authority is granted, may, for the purpose of requiring assistance in the execution of the warrant or the authority, show to either or both of the persons referred to in subsection (2),---
        
    *   (a) in the case of an interception warrant issued to an intelligence and security agency, a copy of the relevant parts of the warrant; or
    
    *   (b) in any other case, a copy of the warrant or evidence of the authority.
    
    (2) The persons are---
        
    *   (a) a network operator:
    
    *   (b) a service provider.
    
    (3) A person who is shown under subsection (1) a copy of an interception warrant or the relevant parts of the warrant, or evidence of any other lawful interception authority, must assist the surveillance agency by---
        
    *   (a) making available any of the person's officers, employees, or agents who are able to provide any reasonable technical assistance that may be necessary for the agency to intercept a telecommunication that is subject to the warrant or authority; and
    
    *   (b) taking all other reasonable steps that are necessary for the purpose of giving effect to the warrant or authority.
    
    (4) For the purposes of this section, a network operator may intercept a telecommunication on behalf of a surveillance agency.

##### 14 Duty to minimise impact of interception on third parties
    
*   Every person who, under an interception warrant or any other lawful interception authority, intercepts or assists in the interception of a telecommunication must take all practicable steps that are reasonable in the circumstances to minimise the likelihood of intercepting telecommunications that are not authorised to be intercepted under the warrant or authority.

## Part 3  
Miscellaneous provisions

#### Transitional provision

##### 15 Network operators have lead-in time to attain interception capability
    
*   (1) [Section 7][12] does not require a network operator to have an interception capability on any public telecommunications network that the operator owns, controls, or operates, or any telecommunications service that the operator provides, at any time before the expiry of the period beginning on the date of commencement of this Act and ending,---
        
    *   (a) in the case of a public switched telephone network or a telecommunications service, 18 months after that commencement; and
    
    *   (b) in the case of a public data network, 5 years after that commencement.
    
    (2) However, any interception capability on a public telecommunications network or a telecommunications service that was in place, or that was the subject of an agreement between the Crown and a network operator, before the commencement of this Act must be developed, installed, and maintained as if subsection (1) and [sections 16][27] and [17][28] had not been enacted.

#### Allocation of costs relating to interception capability

##### 16 Allocation of costs of interception capability on public switched telephone network or telecommunications service

    *   (a) in the case of a public switched telephone network or a telecommunications service that was operational on or before the specified date, by the Crown; or
    
    *   (b) in the case of a public switched telephone network or a telecommunications service that became operational after the specified date, by the network operator that, as the case may be, owns, controls, or operates that network or provides that service.
    
    (2) On the expiry of the period referred to in [section 15(1)(a)][25], the costs of developing, installing, and maintaining an interception capability on a public switched telephone network or a telecommunications service must be paid for by the network operator concerned.
    
    (3) The obligation of the Crown to pay for the costs under subsection (1)(a)---
        
    *   (a) relates only to the fair and reasonable costs associated with any modifications to a public switched telephone network or a telecommunications service that are necessary for that network or service to attain an interception capability; and
    
    *   (b) does not apply to the costs of upgrading a public switched telephone network or a telecommunications service that was operational on or before the specified date unless the sole purpose of upgrading that network or service is to ensure that it has an interception capability (in which case the obligation of the Crown is limited to paying for the costs connected with attaining an interception capability on that network or service and does not extend to the other costs of the upgrade).
    
    (4) In this section, _specified date_ means the date on which this Act was introduced as a Bill into the House of Representatives.
