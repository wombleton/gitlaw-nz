## Part 1  
The territorial sea of New Zealand

##### 3 The territorial sea
    
*   The territorial sea of New Zealand comprises those areas of the sea having, as their inner limits, the baseline described in [sections 5][7] and [6][8] and [6A][9] and, as their outer limits, a line measured seaward from that baseline, every point of which line is distant 12 nautical miles from the nearest point of the baseline.
    
    Section 3: amended, on 1 August 1996, by section 3(1) of the Territorial Sea and Exclusive Economic Zone Amendment Act 1996 (1996 No 74).

##### 4 Internal waters
    
*   The internal waters of New Zealand include any areas of the sea that are on the landward side of the baseline of the territorial sea of New Zealand.

##### 5 Baseline of territorial sea
    
*   (1) Except as otherwise provided in [section 6][8] or [section 6A][9], the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial sea of New Zealand is measured shall be the low-water mark along the coast of New Zealand, including the coast of all islands.
    
    (2) For the purposes of this section, a low-tide elevation that lies wholly or partly within the breadth of sea that would be territorial sea if all low-tide elevations were disregarded for the purpose of the measurement of the breadth of the territorial sea shall be treated as an island.
    
    Section 5(1): amended, on 1 August 1996, by section 3(2) of the Territorial Sea and Exclusive Economic Zone Amendment Act 1996 (1996 No 74).

##### 6 Baseline of territorial sea adjacent to bay
    
*   In the case of the sea adjacent to a bay, the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured---
        
    *   (a) where the bay has only 1 mouth and the distance between the low-water marks of the natural entrance points of the bay does not exceed 24 nautical miles, shall be a straight line joining those low-water marks; and
    
    *   (b) where, because of the presence of islands, the bay has more than 1 mouth and the distances between the low-water marks of the natural entrance points of each mouth added together do not exceed 24 nautical miles, shall be a series of straight lines across each of the mouths so as to join those low-water marks; and
    
    *   (c) where neither paragraph (a) nor paragraph (b) applies, shall be a straight line 24 nautical miles in length drawn from low-water mark to low-water mark within the bay in such a manner as to enclose the maximum area of water that is possible with a line of that length.
    
    

##### 6A Straight baselines
    
*   (1) Subject to [section 6][8], in the following circumstances the method of drawing straight lines joining points may be employed in drawing the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured:
        
    *   (a) where a river flows directly into the sea:
    
    *   (b) where the coast is highly unstable because of the presence of a delta or other natural conditions:
    
    *   (c) where the coast is deeply indented:
    
    *   (d) where there is a fringe of islands along the coast in its immediate vicinity.
    
    (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), the points between which straight lines may be drawn are,---
        
    *   (a) in a case where a river flows directly into the sea, a point at each side of the river's mouth on the low-water line of the river's banks:
    
    *   (b) in a case where the coast is highly unstable because of the presence of a delta or other natural conditions, points along the furtherest seaward extent of the low-water line:
    
    *   (c) in any other case, points that are appropriate in the circumstances.
    
    (3) Where it is necessary to determine the points between which straight lines may be drawn for the purposes of paragraph (b) or paragraph (c) of subsection (2),---
        
    *   (a) the following rules shall be observed:
            
        *   (i) straight baselines shall not depart to any appreciable extent from the general direction of the coast:
        
        *   (ii) sea areas lying within straight baselines shall be sufficiently closely linked to the land of New Zealand to be internal waters of New Zealand:
        
        *   (iii) straight baselines shall be drawn to and from low-tide elevations only where lighthouses or similar installations, which are permanently above sea level, have been built on the low-tide elevations or where the drawing of baselines to and from such elevations has received general international recognition; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) economic interests peculiar to the region concerned, the reality and the importance of which are clearly evidenced by long usage, may be taken into account.
    
    (4) Where, in a case where the coast is highly unstable because of the presence of a delta or other natural conditions, a straight line has been drawn pursuant to this section, that line remains the baseline, notwithstanding any subsequent regression of the low-water line, until it is changed in accordance with this Act.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Territorial Sea, Contiguous Zone, and Exclusive Economic Zone Act 1977\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 15 December 2005, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][61] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][62] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][63] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][64] and [17E][65] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
