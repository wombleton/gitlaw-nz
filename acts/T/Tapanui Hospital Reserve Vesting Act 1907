An Act to vest in the Mayor, Councillors, and Burgesses of the Borough of Tapanui a certain Hospital Reserve in the Town of Tapanui, and to change the Purpose of that Reserve.
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    WHEREAS the land described in the Schedule hereto was formerly set aside as an athenaeum reserve and vested in the Superintendent of Otago, and a public hall had been erected thereon by the Tapanui Athenaeum (incorporated), who managed the reserve for many years and spent considerable public moneys thereon, but the reserve never became actually vested in that body nor in trustees for its benefit: And whereas the Tapanui Athenaeum Trustees in the year eighteen hundred and ninety decided to hand over all their property to the Council of the Borough of Tapanui in trust as a public library for the ratepayers and residents of the borough, and the Council of the borough accepted the said trust: And whereas in the year nineteen hundred and two the said Council decided to erect a new and more commodious hall for similar purposes on land set aside as a town hall and athenaeum reserve in the borough, and to utilise the material of the old hall in the erection thereof, and proposed to have the purpose of the old site changed into another more suitable for local public purposes: And whereas the said Council for this purpose entered into contracts for the removal of the old hall and the erection of a new one, which resulted in the sale of the old building to a purchaser for removal, who paid the price, and the same was expended in aid of the erection of the new hall: And whereas through some misunderstanding before the removal of the old building the purpose of the said lands was changed to that of a site for an hospital without any notification to the Council of the borough or the members of the Tapanui Athenaeum, and became vested in the Tuapeka Hospital Board, who prevented and still prevent the removal of the old building, claiming it as their property in consequence of such vesting: And whereas it is inequitable that the said land and buildings should so pass to the said Board:

BE IT THEREFORE ENACTED by the General Assembly of New Zealand in Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:---

##### 1 Short Title
    
*   This Act may be cited as the Tapanui Hospital Reserve Vesting Act 1907\.

##### 2 Land to vest in Borough of Tapanui
    
*   The certificate of title issued to and in favour of the Tuapeka Hospital Board in respect of the land described in the Schedule hereto is hereby cancelled, and the said land is hereby vested in the Mayor, Councillors, and Burgesses of the Borough of Tapanui for an estate in fee-simple to be held for the purposes of a gymnasium.

##### 3 Old certificate of title to be cancelled, and new one issued
    
*   The District Land Registrar of the District of Otago is hereby empowered and directed to call in and cancel the certificate of title issued in favour of the Tuapeka Hospital Board, and to issue a Land Transfer certificate of title for the land in question to the Mayor, Councillors, and Burgesses of the Borough of Tapanui.

##### 4 Acts of trustees, Tapanui Athenaeum, validated
    
*   The action of the trustees of the Tapanui Athenaeum in transferring all the other property of the said athenaeum to the Borough of Tapanui for the purposes of a public library is hereby validated.
