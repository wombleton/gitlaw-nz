### Subpart 2---New Zealand courts declining jurisdiction on grounds that Australian court is more appropriate forum

##### 21 Guide to this subpart
    
*   (1) This subpart is about when a New Zealand court may stay a proceeding on the grounds that an Australian court is the more appropriate court to determine the matters in issue.
    
    (2) The New Zealand court may only stay the proceeding if the defendant applies for the proceeding to be stayed. The defendant must make the application within 30 working days after being served with the initiating document for the proceeding, or such shorter or longer period that the court considers appropriate.
    
    (3) The New Zealand court may only stay the proceeding if it is satisfied that an Australian court has jurisdiction to determine the matters in issue and that it is the more appropriate court to determine those matters. In determining whether the Australian court is the more appropriate court, the New Zealand court must take certain matters into account. They are set out in [section 24(2)][28].
    
    (4) However, if the parties have made an exclusive choice of court agreement that designates either an Australian court or a New Zealand court as the court to determine the matters in issue, the New Zealand court's order as to whether or not to stay the proceeding must be consistent with that agreement (_see_ [section 25][29]).

    (3) The application must be made---
        
    *   (a) within 30 working days of the New Zealand court after the day on which the defendant was served with the initiating document for the proceeding; or
    
    *   (b) if, before or after the end of the period in paragraph (a), the plaintiff or defendant applies to the New Zealand court for a shorter or longer period---within any shorter or longer period the New Zealand court considers appropriate.

    *   (b) the New Zealand court is determining with a hearing the defendant's application under [section 22][26] for an order to stay the proceeding; and
    
    *   (c) the defendant has made to the New Zealand court within the period (if any) prescribed for the purposes of this paragraph by regulations under subsection (5)(b) a request to appear remotely in the hearing; and
    
    *   (d) a remote appearance medium is, or can reasonably be made, available.

    *   (b) is the more appropriate court to determine those matters.
    
    (2) In determining whether an Australian court is the more appropriate court to determine the matters in issue between the parties to the proceeding, the New Zealand court must not take into account the fact that the proceeding was commenced in New Zealand, but must take into account the following matters:
        
    *   (a) the places of residence of the parties or, if a party is not an individual, its principal place of business:
    
    *   (b) the places of residence of the witnesses likely to be called in the proceeding:

    *   (e) the law that it would be most appropriate to apply in the proceeding:
    
    *   (f) whether a related or similar proceeding has been commenced against the defendant or another person in a court in Australia:
    
    *   (g) the financial circumstances of the parties, so far as the New Zealand court is aware of them:
    
    *   (h) any other matters that the New Zealand court considers relevant.

##### 25 Exclusive choice of court agreements
    
*   (1) On an application under [section 22][26] (and despite [section 24][28]) the New Zealand court---
        
    *   (a) must, by order, stay the proceeding, if satisfied that an exclusive choice of court agreement designates an Australian court as the court to determine the matters in issue between the parties to the proceeding; and
    
    *   (b) must not, by order, stay the proceeding, if satisfied that an exclusive choice of court agreement designates a New Zealand court as the court to determine those matters.
    
    (2) However, subsection (1)(a) does not apply to an exclusive choice of court agreement if the New Zealand court is satisfied that---
        
    *   (a) it is null and void under the law (including, without limitation, the rules of private international law) of Australia; or
    
    *   (b) under New Zealand law, a party to it lacked the capacity to conclude it; or
    
    *   (c) giving effect to it would lead to a manifest injustice or would be manifestly contrary to New Zealand public policy; or
    
    *   (d) for exceptional reasons beyond the control of the parties to it, it cannot reasonably be performed; or
    
    *   (e) the court designated by it as the court to determine the matters in issue between the parties to the proceeding has decided not to determine those matters.
    
    (3) However, subsection (1)(b) does not apply to an exclusive choice of court agreement if the New Zealand court is satisfied that it is null and void under the law (including, without limitation, the rules of private international law) of New Zealand.
    
    (4) _Exclusive choice of court agreement_, in relation to matters in issue between parties to a proceeding, means a written agreement between those parties that---
        
    *   (a) designates the courts, or a specified court or courts, of a specified country, to the exclusion of any other courts, as the court or courts to determine disputes between those parties that are or include those matters; and

    Compare: Service and Execution of Process Act 1992 s 21 (Aust)

##### 29 Suspension of limitation periods for claims made earlier in stayed proceedings in Australian courts
    
*   (1) This section applies if---
        
    *   (a) a claim is made in a proceeding commenced in an Australian court (the _Australian proceeding_) that is later stayed by an order of the Australian Court made under the Australian Act on the grounds that a New Zealand court is the more appropriate court to determine the matters in issue between the parties to the proceeding; and
    
    *   (b) the claim is to be made again in a proceeding commenced in a New Zealand court (the _New Zealand proceeding_) after the staying of (and, if applicable, before any deadline stated in the condition of that order staying) the Australian proceeding.
    
    (2) For the purposes of every applicable limitation period or defence under New Zealand law, the New Zealand proceeding is to be treated as commencing at the time the Australian proceeding commenced.

### Subpart 4---Remote appearances unrelated to remote evidence

#### Introduction

##### 34 Guide to this subpart
    
*   (1) This subpart is about people appearing remotely from Australia in New Zealand civil proceedings, and people appearing remotely from New Zealand in Australian civil proceedings. However, this subpart applies only to remote appearances unrelated to remote evidence in those proceedings. Trans-Tasman remote appearances related to remote evidence in civil or criminal proceedings are governed by [subpart 1][119] of Part 4 of the Evidence Act 2006 (operating in conjunction with the Australian Act).
    
    (2) [Sections 38 to 43][47] are about remote appearances from Australia---
        
    *   (a) in a civil proceeding in a New Zealand court or a prescribed New Zealand tribunal; and
    
    *   (b) by a party or a party's lawyer; and
    
    *   (c) not related to remote evidence in the proceeding.
    
    (3) [Sections 44 to 51][54] are about remote appearances from New Zealand in a civil proceeding in an Australian court or tribunal, where those remote appearances are made in accordance with the Australian Act and are not related to remote evidence in the proceeding. Sections 44 to 51---
        
    *   (a) allow the Australian court or tribunal to exercise certain powers in New Zealand for the purpose of the remote appearances; and
    
    *   (b) give certain privileges, protections, and immunities to participants in the remote appearances; and
    
    *   (c) specify offences that apply for particular conduct engaged in (for example, obstructing the proceeding) at the place in New Zealand from where the remote appearances are being made.

    *   (b) examine a person giving remote evidence:
    
    *   (c) make submissions in relation to remote evidence.
    
    (2) This subpart therefore does not affect, but complements, [subpart 1][119] of Part 4 of the Evidence Act 2006 (operating in conjunction with the Australian Act) and, in particular, the following sections of the [Evidence Act 2006][122]:
        
    *   (a) [sections 168 to 172][96] of that Act (which enable a New Zealand court, as defined in [section 150][98] of that Act, and in any proceeding before it, to receive remote evidence, and examination and submissions in relation to remote evidence, by audio link or audiovisual link from Australia); and
    
    *   (b) [sections 173 to 180][97] of that Act (which enable an Australian court, as defined in [section 150][98] of that Act, and in any proceeding before it, to take remote evidence, and receive examination and submissions in relation to remote evidence, by audio link or audiovisual link from New Zealand).
    
    

##### 36 Courts (Remote Participation) Act 2010 does not apply to appearances under this subpart

### Subpart 5---Recognition and enforcement in New Zealand of specified judgments of Australian courts and tribunals

##### 52 Guide to this subpart
    
*   (1) This subpart is about the enforcement in New Zealand of specified judgments of Australian courts and tribunals.
    
    (2) To be enforceable, the judgment has to be registered in a New Zealand court. To be registered, the judgment must be a registrable Australian judgment (which is defined in [section 54][65]) and an application for its registration must be made.
    
    (3) Once registered in a New Zealand court, the judgment has the same force, and may be enforced in the New Zealand court, as if the judgment had been given by the New Zealand court. There are some exceptions to this---_see_, for example, the following sections:
        
    *   (a) [section 63(2)][74] (which provides that the judgment cannot be enforced during a particular period if notice of the registration has not been given to each liable person); and
    
    *   (b) [section 64][75] (which provides that the judgment cannot be enforced if the judgment could not be enforced in Australia); and
    
    *   (c) [section 65][76] (which provides grounds for when the New Zealand court may stay a proceeding to enforce the judgment).
    
    

##### 53 When registrable Australian judgments are enforceable in New Zealand
    
*   (1) A registrable Australian judgment cannot be enforced in New Zealand if it is not registered in a New Zealand court under section 57\.
    
    (2) By way of explanation, the judgment therefore cannot be enforced by way of---
        
    *   (a) a registration or other enforcement process under [Part 1][135] of the Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Act 1934, [section 56][136] of the Judicature Act 1908, or any other enactment in force in New Zealand; or
    
    *   (b) any common law, or other non-legislative, action or claim to enforce the judgment.
    
    

##### 54 Registrable Australian judgment defined
    
*   (1) A judgment is a _registrable Australian judgment_ if---
        
    *   (a) the judgment is a final and conclusive judgment that is given in a civil proceeding by an Australian court; or
    
    *   (b) both of the following are satisfied:
            
        *   (i) the judgment is a final and conclusive judgment that is given in a civil proceeding by an Australian tribunal declared under [section 55(1)(a)][66] to be a tribunal to which this subpart applies; and

    *   (c) both of the following are satisfied:
            
        *   (i) the judgment is a final and conclusive judgment that is given in a criminal proceeding by an Australian court; and
        
        *   (ii) the judgment is a requirement to pay an injured party a sum of money by way of compensation, damages, or reparation; or
        
        
    
    *   (d) both of the following are satisfied:
            
        *   (i) the judgment is a final and conclusive judgment that is given in a civil proceeding or a criminal proceeding by an Australian court; and
        
        *   (ii) the judgment is an order made under the Australian Act by an Australian court (as defined in [section 150][98] of the Evidence Act 2006) for the payment of expenses (as so defined)---
                
            *   (A) incurred by a witness (as so defined) in complying with an Australian subpoena (as so defined) served on the witness in New Zealand; or
            
            *   (B) incurred by a person in connection with the taking of remote evidence, or the receipt of examination or submissions (as so defined) in relation to remote evidence, from New Zealand by audio link or audiovisual link, as the case may be; or
            
            
        
        
    
    *   (e) the judgment is a final and conclusive judgment that is registered in an Australian court under the Foreign Judgments Act 1991 (Aust).
    
    (2) However, a judgment is not a _registrable Australian judgment_ by virtue of subsection (1) if it wholly or partly---
        
    *   (a) relates to an excluded matter; or
    
    *   (b) is a non-money judgment of a kind that is declared by an order under subsection (3) to be excluded from recognition or enforcement under this subpart; or
    
    *   (c) is a judgment (other than one imposing a civil pecuniary penalty) given in an Australian trans-Tasman market proceeding (but a judgment of that kind is a registrable Australian judgment for the purposes of this subpart by virtue of [subpart 6][80]); or
    
    *   (d) is a judgment (including one given in an Australian trans-Tasman market proceeding) imposing a civil pecuniary penalty (but a judgment of that kind is a registrable Australian judgment for the purposes of this subpart by virtue of [subpart 7][85]); or
    
    *   (e) is an order under proceeds of crime legislation; or
    
    *   (f) is an order relating to the granting of probate or letters of administration or the administration of the estate of a deceased person; or
    
    *   (g) is an order relating to the guardianship or care of a person who is incapable of managing his or her personal affairs; or
    
    *   (h) is an order relating to the management of the property of a person who is incapable of managing that property; or
    
    *   (i) is an order relating to the care, control, or welfare of a child; or
    
    *   (j) is an order that, if contravened by a person to whom it is directed, will make the person liable to conviction for an offence in the place where it was made; or
    
    *   (k) is a judgment given before the commencement of this subpart (even if the judgment is, at any time, registered in an Australian court under the Foreign Judgments Act 1991 (Aust)).
    
    (3) For the purposes of subsection (2)(b), the Governor-General may, by Order in Council, declare a kind of non-money judgment to be excluded from recognition and enforcement under this subpart.
    
    (4) For the purposes of subsection (1), a judgment must be treated as final and conclusive even if---
        
    *   (a) a person may appeal against it in an Australian court; or
    
    *   (b) an appeal against it in an Australian court has not been finally determined.

    *   (b) in any other case, as if it were for an equivalent amount in New Zealand currency, calculated using the rate of exchange on the working day (the _conversion day_) before the day on which the entitled person made the application for registration.
