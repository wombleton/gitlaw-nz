*   #### Preamble
    
    NƒÅ te mea i riro nƒÅ [te Tiriti o Waitangi][492] i motuhake ai te noho a te iwi me te Karauna: ƒÅ, nƒÅ te mea e tika ana kia whaka≈´tia an≈ç te wairua o te wƒÅ i riro atu ai te kƒÅwanatanga kia riro mai ai te mau tonu o te rangatiratanga e takoto nei i roto i [te Tiriti o Waitangi][492]: ƒÅ, nƒÅ te mea e tika ana kia mƒÅrama ko te whenua he taonga tuku iho e tino whakaaro nuitia ana e te iwi MƒÅori, ƒÅ, nƒÅ tƒìrƒÅ he whakahau kia mau tonu taua whenua ki te iwi n≈çna, ki ≈ç rƒÅtou whƒÅnau, hap≈´ hoki, a, a ki te whakangungu i ngƒÅ wƒÅhi tapu hei whakamƒÅmƒÅ i te nohotanga, i te whakahaeretanga, i te whakamahitanga o taua whenua hei painga m≈ç te hunga n≈çna, m≈ç ≈ç rƒÅtou whƒÅnau, hap≈´ hoki: ƒÅ, nƒÅ te mea e tika ana kia t≈´ tonu he Te Kooti, ƒÅ, kia whakatakototia he tikanga hei ƒÅwhina i te iwi MƒÅori kia taea ai ƒìnei kaupapa te whakatinana.
    
    Whereas the [Treaty of Waitangi][492] established the special relationship between the Maori people and the Crown: And whereas it is desirable that the spirit of the exchange of kawanatanga for the protection of rangatiratanga embodied in the [Treaty of Waitangi][492] be reaffirmed: And whereas it is desirable to recognise that land is a taonga tuku iho of special significance to Maori people and, for that reason, to promote the retention of that land in the hands of its owners, their whanau, and their hapu, and to protect wahi tapu: and to facilitate the occupation, development, and utilisation of that land for the benefit of its owners, their whanau, and their hapu: And whereas it is desirable to maintain a court and to establish mechanisms to assist the Maori people to achieve the implementation of these principles.

    *   (b) that there is no apparent reason why the estate of the deceased person should be formally administered.

    *   (a) nominate a registered valuer to make a valuation of the land comprised in the lease as at the date of the termination of the lease, or as at such other date as the lease provides; and
    
    *   (b) notify the lessee in writing of the name of the registered valuer.
    
    (1A) If the lessee does not object to the registered valuer within 14 days after being notified of the nomination, that valuer may conduct the valuation.
    
    (1B) If the lessee does object within 14 days after the notification, and no agreement as to who should conduct the valuation can be reached, the valuation is to be conducted by a registered valuer nominated by the President of the New Zealand Institute of Valuers.
    
    (2) On the completion of a special valuation under this section, the registered valuer shall cause to be prepared a certificate setting forth the following particulars:
        
    *   (a) the name of the lessee:
    
    *   (b) the area of the land comprised in the lease, and the name by which the land is commonly known or other description of the land sufficient to identify it:

    (4) Notwithstanding that the meaning of the expressions _capital value_ and _value of improvements_ or either of them may be amended during the currency of any lease, those expressions shall, for the purposes of valuations to be made under this section in respect of that lease, continue to have the meanings assigned to them by the Valuation of Land Act 1951 as at the commencement of the lease.
    
    (5) For the purposes of any determination by a registered valuer under this section, the Valuation of Land Act 1951 shall be read as if, for the definition of the term _improvements_ set out in section 2 of that Act, there were substituted the following definition:
    
    _improvements_ means all work done or material used at any time on the land by the expenditure of capital or labour by any owner or occupier of the land so far as the effect of the work done or material used is to increase the value of the land, and the benefit thereof is unexhausted at the time of valuation:
    
    provided that the reclamation of land from the sea shall not in any case be deemed to be improvements either of the land reclaimed or of any other land:
    
    provided also that work done or material used on or for the benefit of any land by the expenditure of capital or labour by any owner or occupier of the land in the provision of roads or in the provision of water, drainage, or other amenities in connection with the subdivision of the land for building purposes shall not, after the land has been sold or another person has taken actual occupation of the land (whether by virtue of a tenancy for not less than 6 months or not), be deemed to be improvements on that land.
    
    (6) For the purposes of any determination by a registered valuer under this section, the term _unimproved value_, in relation to any land, means the sum that the owner's estate or interest in the land, if unencumbered by any mortgage or other charge, might be expected to realise at the time of valuation if offered for sale on such reasonable terms and conditions as a bone fide seller might be expected to impose, and if no improvements had been made on the land.
    
    (7) Every certificate given by a registered valuer for the purposes of this section shall have attached to it, or written or printed on it in prominent characters, a notice to the effect that the valuation to which the certificate relates is subject to objection in the manner prescribed by, and within the time limited in accordance with, [section 208][301].

    _unclaimed dividends_ means dividends in the hands of an incorporation that have been held by it or by a preceding incorporation or body corporate (including the MƒÅori Trustee) for at least 10 years without payment to the shareholder or other person entitled.

    (6) If, at any time after the expiry of the said period of 12 months, a claim in respect of any unclaimed dividends is lawfully established by the shareholder or by any person claiming through the shareholder, the amount of the claim shall be payable by the incorporation as a debt due to the claimant accordingly.
    
    (7) If any unclaimed dividends held for a shareholder have been dealt with in the manner provided by subsection (5) and have become the property of the incorporation, any future dividends payable to that shareholder may be similarly dealt with without the necessity of inclusion in a further list of unclaimed dividends, and the provisions of that subsection shall apply accordingly.
