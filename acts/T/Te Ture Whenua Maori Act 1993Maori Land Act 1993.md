*   #### Preamble
    
    Nā te mea i riro nā [te Tiriti o Waitangi][492] i motuhake ai te noho a te iwi me te Karauna: ā, nā te mea e tika ana kia whakaūtia anō te wairua o te wā i riro atu ai te kāwanatanga kia riro mai ai te mau tonu o te rangatiratanga e takoto nei i roto i [te Tiriti o Waitangi][492]: ā, nā te mea e tika ana kia mārama ko te whenua he taonga tuku iho e tino whakaaro nuitia ana e te iwi Māori, ā, nā tērā he whakahau kia mau tonu taua whenua ki te iwi nōna, ki ō rātou whānau, hapū hoki, a, a ki te whakangungu i ngā wāhi tapu hei whakamāmā i te nohotanga, i te whakahaeretanga, i te whakamahitanga o taua whenua hei painga mō te hunga nōna, mō ō rātou whānau, hapū hoki: ā, nā te mea e tika ana kia tū tonu he Te Kooti, ā, kia whakatakototia he tikanga hei āwhina i te iwi Māori kia taea ai ēnei kaupapa te whakatinana.
    
    Whereas the [Treaty of Waitangi][492] established the special relationship between the Maori people and the Crown: And whereas it is desirable that the spirit of the exchange of kawanatanga for the protection of rangatiratanga embodied in the [Treaty of Waitangi][492] be reaffirmed: And whereas it is desirable to recognise that land is a taonga tuku iho of special significance to Maori people and, for that reason, to promote the retention of that land in the hands of its owners, their whanau, and their hapu, and to protect wahi tapu: and to facilitate the occupation, development, and utilisation of that land for the benefit of its owners, their whanau, and their hapu: And whereas it is desirable to maintain a court and to establish mechanisms to assist the Maori people to achieve the implementation of these principles.

    *   (b) that there is no apparent reason why the estate of the deceased person should be formally administered.

##### 207 Compensation to be ascertained by valuation
    
*   (1) For the purpose of ascertaining the amount of compensation to which the lessee under any lease to which this section applies is entitled in accordance with the terms of the lease and this Part, the Māori Trustee, the lessor, or a person acting on behalf of the lessor must, whether of their own motion or at the request of the lessee,---
        
    *   (a) nominate a registered valuer to make a valuation of the land comprised in the lease as at the date of the termination of the lease, or as at such other date as the lease provides; and
    
    *   (b) notify the lessee in writing of the name of the registered valuer.
    
    (1A) If the lessee does not object to the registered valuer within 14 days after being notified of the nomination, that valuer may conduct the valuation.
    
    (1B) If the lessee does object within 14 days after the notification, and no agreement as to who should conduct the valuation can be reached, the valuation is to be conducted by a registered valuer nominated by the President of the New Zealand Institute of Valuers.
    
    (2) On the completion of a special valuation under this section, the registered valuer shall cause to be prepared a certificate setting forth the following particulars:
        
    *   (a) the name of the lessee:
    
    *   (b) the area of the land comprised in the lease, and the name by which the land is commonly known or other description of the land sufficient to identify it:
    
    *   (c) a list of the improvements and the value of those improvements either separately or in classes:
    
    *   (d) the unimproved value of the land:
    
    *   (e) the capital value of the land.
    
    (3) For the purposes of this section, the expressions _capital value_ and _value of improvements_ shall have the meanings given to them respectively by the Valuation of Land Act 1951 (as in force before its repeal by [section 53][718] of the Rating Valuations Act 1998), and, subject to subsections (5) and (6) of this section, every valuation made under this section shall be made in the same manner as if it were a valuation under that Act.
    
    (4) Notwithstanding that the meaning of the expressions _capital value_ and _value of improvements_ or either of them may be amended during the currency of any lease, those expressions shall, for the purposes of valuations to be made under this section in respect of that lease, continue to have the meanings assigned to them by the Valuation of Land Act 1951 as at the commencement of the lease.
    
    (5) For the purposes of any determination by a registered valuer under this section, the Valuation of Land Act 1951 shall be read as if, for the definition of the term _improvements_ set out in section 2 of that Act, there were substituted the following definition:
    
    _improvements_ means all work done or material used at any time on the land by the expenditure of capital or labour by any owner or occupier of the land so far as the effect of the work done or material used is to increase the value of the land, and the benefit thereof is unexhausted at the time of valuation:
    
    provided that the reclamation of land from the sea shall not in any case be deemed to be improvements either of the land reclaimed or of any other land:
    
    provided also that work done or material used on or for the benefit of any land by the expenditure of capital or labour by any owner or occupier of the land in the provision of roads or in the provision of water, drainage, or other amenities in connection with the subdivision of the land for building purposes shall not, after the land has been sold or another person has taken actual occupation of the land (whether by virtue of a tenancy for not less than 6 months or not), be deemed to be improvements on that land.
    
    (6) For the purposes of any determination by a registered valuer under this section, the term _unimproved value_, in relation to any land, means the sum that the owner's estate or interest in the land, if unencumbered by any mortgage or other charge, might be expected to realise at the time of valuation if offered for sale on such reasonable terms and conditions as a bone fide seller might be expected to impose, and if no improvements had been made on the land.
    
    (7) Every certificate given by a registered valuer for the purposes of this section shall have attached to it, or written or printed on it in prominent characters, a notice to the effect that the valuation to which the certificate relates is subject to objection in the manner prescribed by, and within the time limited in accordance with, [section 208][301].
