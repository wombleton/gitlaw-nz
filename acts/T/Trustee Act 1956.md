    (7) Where the donee of any power of attorney relating to any trust or estate is not a corporation aggregate, a certificate in [form 1][174] of Schedule 4, or to the like effect, shall, if given by the donee of the power of attorney, be taken to be conclusive evidence that the power of attorney has come into operation and that in any particular transaction the donee is acting in the execution of the trust or the administration of the estate.

    (7B) Where any such certificate relates to the execution of any instrument, it shall be sufficient if the certificate is endorsed on the instrument and signed by the donee of the power or by any of the persons specified in subsection (7A), as the case may be.

    (9) For the purpose of executing or exercising the trusts, powers, authorities, and discretions delegated to him the donee may exercise any of the powers, authorities, and discretions conferred on the donor as trustee by statute or by the instrument creating the trust, except the power of delegation conferred by this section.

##### 40 Power to apply income for maintenance, etc, and to accumulate surplus income during a minority
    
*   (1) Where any property is held by a trustee in trust for any person for any interest whatsoever, whether vested or contingent, then, subject to any prior interests or charges affecting that property,---
        
    *   (a) during the infancy of any such person, if his interest so long continues, the trustee may, at his sole discretion, pay to his parent or guardian, if any, or otherwise apply for or towards his maintenance or education (including past maintenance or education) or his advancement or benefit, the whole or such part, if any, of the income of that property as may, in all the circumstances, be reasonable, whether or not there is---
            
        *   (i) any other fund applicable to the same purpose; or
        
        *   (ii) any person bound by law to provide for his maintenance, education, advancement, or benefit; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) if the person on attaining the age of 20 years has not a vested interest in that income, the trustee shall thenceforth pay the income of that property and of any accretion thereto under subsection (2) to him until he either attains a vested interest therein or dies, or until failure of his interest:
    
    provided that, in deciding whether the whole or any part of the income of the property is during a minority to be paid or applied for the purposes aforesaid, the trustee shall have regard to the age of the infant and his requirements and generally to the circumstances of the case, and in particular to what other income, if any, is applicable for the same purposes; and where the trustee has notice that the income of more than 1 fund is applicable for those purposes, then, so far as practicable, unless the entire income of the funds is paid or applied as aforesaid or the court otherwise directs, a proportionate part only of the income of each fund shall be so paid or applied.
    
    (2) During the infancy of any such person, if his interest so long continues, the trustee shall accumulate all the residue of that income in the way of compound interest by investing the same and the resulting income thereof from time to time in accordance with the trust instrument or the provisions of this Act as to the investment of trust funds, and shall hold those accumulations as follows:
        
    *   (a) if any such person---
            
        *   (i) attains the age of 20 years, or marries or enters into a civil union under that age, and his interest in the income during his infancy or until he or she marries or enters into a civil union is a vested interest; or
        
        *   (ii) on attaining the age of 20 years or on marrying or entering into a civil union under that age becomes entitled to the property from which the income arose in fee simple absolute or determinable, or absolutely---
        
        the trustee shall hold the accumulations in trust for that person absolutely, but without prejudice to any provision with respect thereto contained in any settlement by him made under any statutory powers during his infancy, and so that the receipt of that person after marrying or entering into a civil union, and though still an infant, shall be a good discharge; and
    
    *   (b) in any other case the trustee shall, notwithstanding that that person had a vested interest in the income, hold the accumulations as an accretion to the capital of the property from which the accumulations arose and as 1 fund with that capital for all purposes,---
    
    but the trustee may, at any time during the infancy of that person if his interest so long continues, apply those accumulations, or any part thereof, as if they were income arising in the then current year.
    
    (3) This section applies in the case of a contingent interest only if the limitation or trust carries the intermediate income of the property, but it applies to a future or contingent legacy by the parent of, or a person standing in the place of a parent to, the legatee, if and for such period as, under the general law, the legacy carries interest for the maintenance of the legatee, and in any such case as last aforesaid the rate of interest shall (if the income available is sufficient and subject to any rules of court to the contrary) be that for the time being prescribed by or under [section 39][187] of the Administration Act 1969\.
    
    (4) This section applies to a vested annuity in like manner as if the annuity were the income of property held by a trustee in trust to pay the income thereof to the annuitant for the same period for which the annuity is payable, save that in any case accumulations made during the infancy of the annuitant shall be held in trust for the annuitant or his personal representatives absolutely.

        *   (ii) in any other case $7,500, or such other amount as the Governor-General, by Order in Council, may for the time being prescribe in place of that amount; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) where that person or any other person is or becomes absolutely and indefeasibly entitled to the share of the trust property in which that person had a presumptive or vested interest when the money or asset was so paid or applied, that money or asset shall be brought into account as part of that share in the trust property; and
    
    *   (c) no such payment or application shall be made so as to prejudice any person entitled to any prior life or other interest, whether vested or contingent, in the money or asset paid or applied unless that person is in existence and of full age and consents in writing to the payment or application, or unless the court, on the application of the trustee, so orders.

    *   (a) upon trust for the principal beneficiary during the trust period or until he, whether before or after the termination of any prior interest, does or attempts to do or suffers any act or thing, or until any event happens, other than an advance under any statutory or express power, whereby, if the said income were payable during the trust period to the principal beneficiary absolutely during that period, he would be deprived of the right to receive the same or any part thereof, in any of which cases, as well as on the termination of the trust period, whichever first happens, this trust of the said income shall fail or determine;
    
    *   (b) if the trust aforesaid fails or determines during the subsistence of the trust period, then, during the residue of that period, the said income shall be held upon trust for the application thereof for the maintenance or support, or otherwise for the benefit, of all or any 1 or more exclusively of the other or others of the following persons, that is to say:
            
        *   (i) the principal beneficiary and his or her wife, husband, civil union partner, or de facto partner, if any, and his or her children or more remote issue, if any; or
        
        *   (ii) if there is no wife or husband or civil union partner or de facto partner or issue of the principal beneficiary in existence, the principal beneficiary and the persons who would, if he were actually dead, be entitled to the trust property or the income thereof or to the annuity fund, if any, or arrears of the annuity, as the case may be;
        
        as the trustee in his absolute discretion, without being liable to account for the exercise of such discretion, thinks fit.
    
    (2) This section shall not apply to trusts coming into operation before the commencement of this Act, and has effect subject to any variation of the implied trusts aforesaid contained in the instrument creating the trust.

*   (1) Where any property settled by way of succession is employed in a business that the trustee is empowered or authorised to carry on, and the trustee considers that in the interests of the persons entitled to the income or capital of the property, and in accordance with good business practice, it is expedient to set aside and retain as a capital reserve part of the income or profits arising therefrom in any period, then, notwithstanding any rule of law to the contrary, and without in any way affecting any other power conferred on him by this Act or any other enactment (including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the power to set up a depreciation or replacement fund under [section 15(2)][39]), or by the instrument creating the trust, it shall be lawful for but not obligatory upon the trustee to direct that such part of the income or profits arising from the property in that period as he determines shall cease to be income and shall become a capital reserve of the business.
    
    (2) Any income or profits reserved by the trustee under this section may be applied by him in his discretion either immediately or at any time or times thereafter in, for, or towards all or any of the following purposes:
        
    *   (a) the payment or discharge of any debts or liabilities of the business that are properly payable out of capital:

##### 42B Power to apply capital of business for maintenance
    
*   (1) Where any property settled by way of succession is employed in a business that the trustee is empowered or authorised to carry on, and the trustee considers in any period that the income arising from the business and available for distribution to the person entitled to receive it (in this section referred to as the **income beneficiary**) is insufficient for the proper maintenance of the income beneficiary, having regard to any other income received or to be received during that period by the income beneficiary from whatever source and to all the other circumstances of the case, then, notwithstanding any rule of law to the contrary, and without in any way affecting any other power conferred on him by this Act or any other enactment (including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the power to make advances out of income and capital under [sections 40][72] and [41][73]) or by the instrument creating the trust, it shall be lawful for but not obligatory upon the trustee to pay or apply any capital money or other capital asset subject to the trust and employed in the business (including any money for the time being standing to the credit of any fund established by the trustee under [section 15(2)][39] or [section 42A][77]) for the maintenance or benefit, in such manner as he may in his absolute discretion think fit, of the income beneficiary.
    
    (2) If, in any such case, the trustee pays or applies any capital money or capital asset for the maintenance or benefit of the income beneficiary in accordance with subsection (1), and, in any subsequent period, the trustee considers that the income available from the business for distribution to the income beneficiary is more than sufficient for the proper maintenance of the income beneficiary, having regard to any other income received or to be received during that subsequent period by the income beneficiary from whatever source and to all the other circumstances of the case, then the trustee may recoup the whole or such part as he thinks fit of the sum so paid (or of a sum equivalent to the value of the capital asset so applied) from the income arising from the business during that period and available for distribution to the income beneficiary.

##### 42D Apportionment of income
    
*   Where any property settled by way of succession is employed in a business that the trustee is empowered or authorised to carry on, and the trustee considers that, in order better to determine the net income of the business that is available in any period for appropriation and distribution to the person or persons entitled under the trust to the income therefrom, it is expedient to do so, he may---
        
    *   (a) instead of commencing the accounting period to determine such income with the date of the commencement of the trust, adopt the accounting period employed in respect of the business immediately before the commencement of the trust, continue the accounting period so employed and current immediately before the commencement of the trust, and apportion the income so determined on such basis as if it had accrued evenly during that accounting period:
    
    *   (b) instead of preparing final accounts, in respect of any interest in the whole or any part of the income arising from the business, as at the date of the termination of that interest, prepare such accounts at the end of the accounting period employed in respect of the business immediately before the date of the termination of the interest and current at that date, and apportion the income so determined on such basis as if it had accrued evenly during that accounting period.

    (2) On the appointment of a trustee or trustees for the whole or any part of trust property---
        
    *   (a) the number of trustees may be increased; and

    provided that an additional trustee or additional trustees shall not be appointed under this subsection without the consent of---
        
    *   (a) the trustee or trustees for the time being; or
    
    *   (b) the court.
    
    (6) Every new trustee appointed under this section as well before as after all the trust property becomes by law, or by assurance, or otherwise, vested in him, shall have the same powers, authorities, and discretions, and may in all respects act as if he had been originally appointed a trustee by the instrument, if any, creating the trust.
    
    (7) The provisions of this section relative to a trustee who is dead include the case of a person nominated trustee whether sole or otherwise in a will, and who dies before the testator; and those relative to a continuing trustee include a refusing or retiring trustee, if willing to act in the execution of the provisions of this section.
    
    (8) The provisions of this section relative to a person nominated for the purpose of appointing new trustees apply whether the appointment is made in a case specified in this section or in a case specified in the instrument, if any, creating the trust, but where a new trustee is appointed under this section in a case specified in that instrument, the appointment shall be subject to the terms applicable to an appointment in that case under the provisions of that instrument.

## Part 5  
Powers of the court

#### Appointment of new trustees

##### 51 Power of court to appoint new trustees
    
*   (1) The court may, whenever it is expedient to appoint a new trustee or new trustees, and it is found inexpedient, difficult, or impracticable so to do without the assistance of the court, make an order appointing a new trustee or new trustees, either in substitution for or in addition to any existing trustee or trustees, or although there is no existing trustee.
    
    (2) In particular and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing provision, the court may make an order appointing a new trustee in substitution for a trustee who---
        
    *   (a) has been held by the court to have misconducted himself in the administration of the trust; or
    
    *   (b) is convicted of a crime involving dishonesty as defined by [section 2][200] of the Crimes Act 1961; or
    
    *   (c) is a mentally disordered person within the meaning of the [Mental Health (Compulsory Assessment and Treatment) Act 1992][201], or whose estate or any part thereof is subject to a property order made under the [Protection of Personal and Property Rights Act 1988][148]; or
    
    *   (d) is a bankrupt; or
    
    *   (e) is a corporation which has ceased to carry on business, or is in liquidation, or has been dissolved.
    
    (3) An order under this section, and any consequential vesting order or conveyance, shall not operate further or otherwise as a discharge to any former or continuing trustee than an appointment of new trustees under any power for that purpose contained in any instrument would have operated.
    
    (4) Nothing in this section shall give power to appoint an executor or administrator.
    
    (5) Every trustee appointed by the court shall, as well before as after the trust property becomes by law, or by assurance, or otherwise, vested in him, have the same powers, authorities, and discretions, and may in all respects act as if he had been originally appointed a trustee by the instrument, if any, creating the trust.

##### 73 Power to relieve trustee from personal liability
    
*   If it appears to the court that a trustee, whether appointed by the court or otherwise, is or may be personally liable for any breach of trust, whether the transaction alleged to be a breach of trust occurred before or after the commencement of this Act, but has acted honestly and reasonably, and ought fairly to be excused for the breach of trust and for omitting to obtain the directions of the court in the matter in which he committed the breach, then the court may relieve him either wholly or partly from personal liability for the same.
    
    Compare: 1908 No 200 s 89; Trustee Act 1925 s 61 (UK)

##### 74 Power to make beneficiary indemnify for breach of trust
    
*   (1) Where a trustee commits a breach of trust at the instigation or request or with the consent in writing of a beneficiary, the court may, if it thinks fit, and notwithstanding that the beneficiary may be a married woman restrained from anticipation, make such order as to the court seems just for impounding all or any part of the interest of the beneficiary in the trust estate by way of indemnity to the trustee or persons claiming through him.
    
    (2) This section applies to breaches of trust committed as well before as after the commencement of this Act.
    
    Compare: 1908 No 200 s 88; Trustee Act 1925 s 62 (UK)

##### 75 Barring of claims
    
*   (1) Where a trustee desires to reject a claim that has been made, or that he has reason to believe may be made,---
        
    *   (a) to or against the estate or property that he is administering; or
    
    *   (b) against the trustee personally by reason of his being under any liability in respect of which he is entitled to reimburse himself out of the estate or property that he is administering---
    
    the trustee may serve upon the claimant or the person who may become a claimant as aforesaid a notice calling upon him, within a period of 3 months from the date of service of the notice, to take legal proceedings to enforce the claim and also to prosecute the proceedings with all due diligence.
    
    (2) At the expiration of that period the trustee may apply to the court for an order under subsection (3), and shall serve a copy of the application on the person concerned.
    
    (3) If on the hearing of that application that person does not satisfy the court that he has commenced the proceedings and is prosecuting them with all due diligence, the court may make an order---
        
    *   (a) extending the period, or barring the claim, or enabling the trust property to be dealt with without regard to the claim; and
    
    *   (b) imposing such conditions and giving such directions, including a direction as to the payment of the costs of or incidental to the application, as to the court seems just.
    
    (3A) Where a trustee has served any such notices in respect of claims on 2 or more persons and the period specified in each of the said notices has expired, he may, if he thinks fit, apply for an order in respect of the claims of those persons in a single application, and the court may on that application make an order accordingly.
    
    (4) This section shall apply to every such claim as aforesaid, whether the claim is or may be made under the [Law Reform (Testamentary Promises) Act 1949][184] or as creditor or next of kin or beneficiary under the trust or otherwise:
    
    provided that nothing in this section shall apply to any claim under the [Family Protection Act 1955][183], and no order made under this section shall affect any application for revocation of any grant of administration, whether that application is made before or after the order.
    
    (5) \[Repealed\]
    
    (6) On an application by a trustee under this section, the persons beneficially entitled to the estate or property need not be made parties to the proceedings, and no order made by the court on the application shall prejudice their right to contest the claim of the trustee to be entitled to indemnify himself out of the estate or property that he is administering if they have not been parties to the proceedings in which the order was made.

##### 76 Distribution of shares of missing beneficiaries
    
*   (1) Where any property is held by a trustee and the property or any part thereof cannot be distributed because the trustee does not know whether any person who is or may be entitled thereto is or at any material date was in existence, or whether all or any of the persons who are members of any class who are or may be entitled thereto are or at any material date were in existence, or because the trustee does not know whether any such person is alive or dead or where he is, the trustee may publish such advertisements (whether in New Zealand or elsewhere) as are appropriate in the circumstances calling upon every such person and every person claiming through any such person to send in his claim within a time to be specified in the advertisements, not being less than 2 months in any case from the date on which the advertisement is published. Where the trustee is in doubt as to what advertisements should be published under this subsection, he may apply to the court for directions in that regard.
    
    (2) Where the trustee has received (whether as a result of the advertisements or not) any claim to be a person to whom any such advertisement relates, or any notice that any person may claim to be such a person, but the trustee is not satisfied that the claim is or would be valid, the trustee may serve upon the claimant or the person of whom the trustee has notice as aforesaid, a notice calling upon him, within a period of 3 months from the date of service of the notice, to take legal proceedings to enforce the claim, if he wishes to pursue it, and to prosecute the proceedings with all due diligence; and advising him that, if he fails to do so, his claim may be disregarded and application may be made to the court without further notice for an order authorising the distribution of the property. Nothing in this subsection shall make it necessary for the trustee to serve such a notice on any such person; and the court may make an order under this section, whether or not such a notice has been served on any such person, if it is satisfied that the information supplied to the trustee by that person or otherwise in the possession of the trustee indicates either that the person is not one of the persons specified in the advertisements or that he is not likely to be one of those persons.
    
    (3) Upon proof by affidavit of the circumstances, and of the inquiries that have been made, and of the results of inquiries and advertisements, and of the claims of which the trustee has received notice, and of the notices that the trustee has given to claimants under subsection (2), and of the action (if any) which the claimants have taken to enforce their claims, the court may order that the trustee may distribute the property or part thereof, subject to such conditions as the court may impose,---
        
    *   (a) as if every person and every member of any class of persons specified in the order (being all or any of the persons specified in the advertisements) is not in existence or never existed or has died before a date or event specified in the order; and
    
    *   (b) where as a consequence of the order it is not possible or practicable to determine whether or not any condition or requirement affecting a beneficial interest in the property or any part thereof has been complied with or fulfilled, as if that condition or requirement had or had not been complied with or fulfilled (as the court may determine).
    
    (4) In making any order under subsection (3), the court may---
        
    *   (a) disregard (without express reference thereto in the order) the claims of any persons who do not appear to the court to be, or to be likely to be, any of the persons specified in the advertisements:
    
    *   (b) disregard (without express reference thereto in the order) the claim of any person to whom the trustee has given notice under subsection (2) and who has failed to take legal proceedings to enforce the claim or to prosecute any such proceedings with all due diligence:
    
    *   (c) exclude from the operation of the order any person to whom the trustee has not given notice under subsection (2) and who in the opinion of the court may be one of the persons specified in the advertisements, or any person whom the court considers should for any reason be excluded from the operation of the order:
    
    *   (d) provide that the order shall not be acted on for such period or except on such conditions as may be specified in the order or that the effect of the order shall during a period so specified be advertised in such manner and form as may be specified in the order, or that the order be served upon such person or persons as are specified therein; and in the event of the court exercising the jurisdiction conferred by this paragraph it may in the order direct that the same shall be of no effect in respect of any person specified therein in the event of that person instituting proceedings in New Zealand to enforce his claim and serving the proceedings upon the trustee within such period as is specified in the order.
    
    (5) Any such order may be made notwithstanding that there has not been strict compliance with any directions as to advertisements previously given by the court, or that an error has been made in any advertisement (whether or not any directions have previously been given by the court) if the court considers that the error would not be likely to have prejudiced or misled the persons to whom the advertisement relates.
    
    (6) Where the court makes an order under this section that the trustee may distribute any property or part thereof as if every person and every member of any class of persons specified in the order (not being a person expressly excluded from the operation of the order) is not in existence or never existed or has died before a date or event specified in the order, and the trustee distributes in accordance with the order, the trustee shall be exonerated from any further liability to any such person or to any member of any such class:
    
    provided that nothing in this subsection shall prejudice any remedy which any person may have against any person other than the trustee, including any right which he may have to follow the property and any money or property into which it is converted.
    
    (7) The court may make 1 or more orders under this section in respect of the same property.
    
    (8) Any order made under this section may direct how the costs of the order and of advertising under or for the purposes of the order shall be borne.
    
    (9) It shall not be necessary to serve notice of an application for an order under this section upon any person, unless the court otherwise orders.
    
    (10) Nothing in this section shall prejudice the right of the trustee (if he so desires) to distribute under any other law or statutory provision or prejudice the protection thereby afforded when he makes distribution pursuant to any such law or provision.
    
    Section 76: replaced, on 25 October 1960, by section 12 of the Trustee Amendment Act 1960 (1960 No 101).

*   (1) Any notice, application, or order that is to be served in accordance with [section 75][122] or [section 76][123], or in accordance with any order made pursuant to section 76, may be served---
        
    *   (a) either by delivering it to the person for whom it is intended or by sending it by post in a registered letter addressed to that person at his usual or last known place of abode or business; or
    
    *   (b) in such other manner as may be directed by an order of the court.
    
    (2) Where a notice is sent by post as aforesaid it shall be deemed to be served at the time at which the letter would have been delivered in the ordinary course of post.

All money and securities so paid or transferred shall be administered in the Treasury. All such money and all money derived from securities which have been transferred to or vested in the Crown under this section shall be credited by the Secretary to the Treasury to the Trust Account established under section 42 of the Public Finance Act 1977 to be dealt with as hereafter provided in this Act.
    
    (2) The receipt of the Secretary to the Treasury shall be a sufficient discharge to the trustees for the money or securities paid or transferred to the Crown under this section.
    
    (3) Where money or securities are vested in any persons as trustees, and the majority are desirous of paying or transferring the same to the Crown as aforesaid, but the concurrence of the other or others cannot be obtained, the court may order the payment or transfer to the Crown to be made by the majority without the concurrence of the other or others.
    
    (4) Where any such money or securities are deposited with any banker, broker, or other depositary, the court may order payment or delivery of the money or securities to the majority of the trustees for the purpose of payment or transfer to the Crown.
    
    (5) Every transfer, payment, and delivery made in pursuance of any such order shall be valid and take effect as if the same had been made on the authority or by the act of all the persons entitled to the money and securities so transferred, paid, or delivered.
    
    (6) The Secretary to the Treasury may at any time sell any securities held by the Crown under this section.
    
    (7) Where any securities have been transferred to or deposited with any Registrar under section 67 of the Trustee Act 1908 or under the corresponding provisions of any former enactment and are held by him at the commencement of this Act, those securities shall thereupon vest without transfer or assignment in the Crown.
    
    (8) Where any trustee has obtained or is seeking a discharge in respect of any money or securities under this section or has obtained such a discharge under the corresponding provisions of any former section, the Secretary to the Treasury may at any time require that trustee to give such information in his possession or control as he may require in relation to the persons beneficially entitled to the money or securities, including information as to the steps taken to trace those persons; and if any person refuses or wilfully neglects to give any such information that is in his possession or control when so required, or wilfully gives any false information in answer to any such requisition, he or she commits an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $200\.

    *   (a) money which has not previously been credited to a Crown Bank Account under subsection (4); and
    
    *   (b) securities which were transferred to the Crown within the immediately preceding 6 years or which were transferred or deposited into or in the name of any Registrar under section 67 of the Trustee Act 1908 within the immediately preceding 6 years.
    
    (2) Every statement so published in the _Gazette_ shall contain sufficient particulars to show the matters in which the money and securities are held by the Crown and the amount held in respect of each matter.
    
    (3) All money and securities for the time being held by the Crown under [section 77][126] (whether or not they are held in a Crown Bank Account) shall be so held to attend the order of the court:
    
    provided that any such money or securities may be paid or transferred by the Secretary to the Treasury to the person entitled thereto upon his establishing a claim thereto or may be paid or transferred to the person from whom they were received to be held by him as trustee if that person so requests:
    
    provided also that all costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the Crown or the Secretary to the Treasury in connection with any such money or securities may be deducted out of the money or securities or out of any other money and securities which are for the time being held by the Crown and are subject to the same trusts.
    
    (4) The Secretary to the Treasury shall from time to time transfer to a Crown Bank Account all money held under [section 77][126], being money which was---

    (6) Under no circumstances shall the liability of the Crown or the Secretary to the Treasury in respect of any securities which are transferred to or vested in the Crown under [section 77][126] exceed the value of those securities and of any other securities and money which are held by the Crown and subject to the same trusts at the time when demand is made for satisfaction of the liability. If the said securities and money are insufficient to meet any such liability, the claimant shall, in respect of any unpaid balance of the liability, have the same rights and remedies against the person beneficially entitled to the securities in respect of which the liability arose as he would if those securities were transferred to that person.
    
    (7) Neither the Crown nor the Secretary to the Treasury shall have the duties or liabilities of a trustee in respect of any money or securities for the time being held by the Crown under [section 77][126] (whether in a Crown Bank Account or not); and no interest shall be payable by the Crown or the Secretary to the Treasury in respect of any money so held.
    
    (8) Where any money or securities paid or transferred to any claimant under this section are afterwards claimed by any other person, the Crown and the Secretary to the Treasury shall not be responsible for the payment or transfer thereof, but that person shall have recourse against the claimant to whom the money was paid or the securities were transferred.

##### 83 Special rules as to apportionment on purchase, sale, or transfer in certain cases
    
*   (1) For the purposes of this section---
        
    *   (a) the term _fixed-income asset_ means any asset bearing interest or carrying the right to a dividend if---
            
        *   (i) the interest or dividend is payable at a fixed rate; and
        
        *   (ii) the trustee has no reason to believe that the interest or dividend payable in respect of the period to which the apportionment relates will not be paid reasonably promptly after the interest or dividend falls due:
        
        
    
    *   (b) the term _shares_ means shares or stock of any company, whether incorporated in or outside New Zealand, except any such shares or stock which constitutes a fixed-income asset in accordance with paragraph (a):
    
    *   (c) an appropriation of shares (whether pursuant to the power conferred by paragraph (j) of subsection (1) of [section 15][39] or otherwise) shall be deemed to be a transfer of those shares to which subsection (4) applies.
    
    (2) Where any payment received by a trustee in respect of a sale of any fixed-income asset is or includes payment for the right to receive income accrued from that asset at the time of sale, though the income may not then be due, the amount of the accrued income shall, for the purposes of the trust, be deemed to have been received as income in respect of the period during which it so accrued.
    
    (3) Where any payment made by a trustee in respect of a purchase of any fixed-income asset is or includes payment for the right to receive any income accrued from that asset at the time of the purchase, though the income may not then be due, the amount of the accrued income when received shall, for the purposes of the trust, be deemed to have been received as purchase money repaid.
    
    (4) Where a trustee transfers any shares (not being a fixed-income asset) to the person entitled thereto under the trust, then, unless the trustee in his absolute discretion having regard to all the circumstances of the case thinks that it is equitable, practicable, and convenient to make an apportionment, there shall be no apportionment of any dividends which have accrued at the date of transfer but have not then been declared, and no person who would have been beneficially interested in any such dividends if they had been declared and paid to the trustee shall have any claim in respect thereof against the trustee or against the transferee of the shares.
    
    (5) Where a trustee sells any shares that are not a fixed-income asset, no part of the proceeds of the sale shall, for the purposes of the trust, be deemed to have been paid for the right to receive dividends which have accrued in respect of the shares at the time of the sale, but have not then been declared, and there shall accordingly be no apportionment of the proceeds as between capital and income.
    
    (6) Where a trustee purchases any shares that are not a fixed-income asset, no part of the purchase price shall, for the purposes of the trust, be deemed to be paid for the right to receive any dividends which have accrued in respect of the shares at the time of the purchase but have not then been declared, and there shall accordingly be no apportionment of the purchase price as between capital and income, nor shall any part of the dividends received by the trustee be deemed to have been received as purchase money repaid.
    
    (7) Except as herein expressly provided, nothing in this section shall affect the rights and obligations of the trustee or of any other person in respect of apportionment of income on the sale or purchase of any asset or the transfer thereof to any person beneficially entitled thereto.
    
    (8) Anything done by a trustee before the commencement of this section which would have been authorised by this section if then in force shall be deemed to have been authorised by this section.
    
    (9) The provisions of this section shall apply if and so far only as a contrary intention is not expressed in the instrument, if any, creating the trust, and shall have effect subject to the terms of that instrument.

##### 83B Audit of other trust estates

    provided that---
        
    *   (a) except with the leave of the court, such an investigation or audit shall not be required within 12 months after any such previous investigation or audit; and
    
    *   (b) a beneficiary shall not be appointed under this section to make an investigation or audit; and
    
    *   (c) Public Trust may require the applicant to deposit a sum of money covering the costs of the investigation and audit, as estimated by Public Trust, or to secure the same to Public Trust's satisfaction before proceeding with the application.
    
    (2) The person making the investigation or audit (in this section called the **auditor**) shall have a right of access to the books, accounts, and vouchers of the trustees, and to any securities and documents of title held by them on account of the estate, and may require from them such information and explanations as may be necessary for the performance of his duties.
    
    (3) Upon the completion of the investigation and audit, the auditor shall forward to the applicant, and to every trustee, and to Public Trust, a copy of the accounts of the estate, together with a report thereon, and a certificate signed by him to the effect that the accounts correctly show the state of the affairs of the estate, and that he has had the securities of the trust fund investments (if any) produced to and verified by him, or (as the case may be) that such accounts are deficient in such respects as may be specified in that certificate.
    
    (4) Every beneficiary shall, subject to the provisions of any regulations made under this section, be entitled at all reasonable times to inspect and take copies of the accounts, report, and certificate, and, at his own expense, to be furnished with copies thereof or extracts therefrom.

    (6) The remuneration of the auditor and the other expenses of the investigation and audit (including Public Trust's charges) shall be such as may be prescribed by regulations under this section or (in the absence of any such prescription) as may be determined by the court, and shall, unless the court otherwise orders, be borne by the estate; and, in the event of the court so ordering, such expenses shall be borne by the trustees personally or any of them, or by the applicant, or be apportioned between them or any of them, or between them and any of them and the estate, in such proportions as the court thinks just.
    
    (7) If any person having the custody of any books, accounts, vouchers, securities, or documents to which the auditor has a right of access under this section fails or refuses to allow him to have access thereto, or in anywise obstructs the investigation or audit, the auditor may apply to the court, and thereupon the court shall make such order as it thinks just.
    
    (8) Subject to any rules of court, applications under or for the purposes of this section to the court shall be made to a Judge in Chambers.
    
    (9) If any person in any statement of accounts, report, or certificate required for the purposes of this section wilfully makes a statement that is false in any material particular, he or she is liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or a fine not exceeding $200, or both.
    
    (10) Public Trust shall not be liable for any expenses or costs under this section.
    
    (11) All expenses and costs for which the estate is liable under this section shall be a charge on the assets of the estate, and that charge may be enforced in such manner as the court directs.
    
    (12) The Governor-General may from time to time, by Order in Council, make all such regulations as may in his opinion be necessary or expedient for specifying the procedure and regulating the remuneration, expenses, charges, and other matters in regard to the investigation and audit of trust estates.
    
    (13) All regulations made under this section shall be laid before Parliament within 28 days after the date of the making thereof if Parliament is then in session and, if not, shall be laid before Parliament within 28 days after the date of the commencement of the next ensuing session.
