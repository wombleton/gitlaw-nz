An Act to enable the Thames Borough Council to make and levy rates on behalf of the Hauraki Catchment Board each year at the same time as it makes and levies the borough rates and also to remove the trust provisions and mining reservations in respect of certain lands now vested in the Thames Borough Council and to prevent the granting of mining privileges over the surface of such lands under the provisions of the Mining Act 1926 and to empower the Council to dispose of part of such lands
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    Whereas the Borough of Thames is a constituent district of the Hauraki Catchment District:
    
    And whereas the Hauraki Catchment Board, pursuant to [section 95][11] of the Soil Conservation and Rivers Control Act 1941, may by special order direct the Thames Borough Council to make and levy rates on behalf of the Hauraki Catchment Board:
    
    And whereas the Hauraki Catchment Board is unable to notify the Thames Borough Council until the month of May in each rating year the amount of the rates to be made and levied for that year:
    
    And whereas the Council, pursuant to [section 19][12] of the Local Legislation Act 1947 and section 15 of the Thames Borough Commissioner Amendment Act 1934, demands the borough rates prior to receiving the notice from the Hauraki Catchment Board:
    
    And whereas it is expedient that the Thames Borough Council be empowered at the same time as it makes and levies the borough rates for any rating year to make and levy any rates directed by the Hauraki Catchment Board to be made and levied by the Thames Borough Council on behalf of the Hauraki Catchment Board:
    
    And whereas by the certificate of title mentioned in the [Schedule][10] the Thames Harbour Board was seized of an estate in fee simple in, _inter alia,_ the lands described in that schedule in trust for the improvement and maintenance of the harbour of the Port of Thames and the construction and maintenance of such harbour works at the said port as might be deemed advisable by the said Board:
    
    And whereas the said lands, pursuant to section 5 of the Thames Harbour Act 1936, are now vested in the Corporation of the Borough of Thames:
    
    And whereas the necessity for the improvement and maintenance of the harbour of the Port of Thames and the construction and maintenance of such harbour works at the said port has now ceased to exist.

*   (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the [Soil Conservation and Rivers Control Act 1941][13], the Hauraki Catchment Board may in respect of any rating year, by resolution, direct the Thames Borough Council to make and levy on behalf of the Board any rate that may be made and levied by the Board under that Act. Any such resolution may be passed notwithstanding that the Board has not at the time of the resolution made and levied any such rate, and it shall not be necessary for the amount of any such rate to be fixed in the resolution.
    
    (2) Where notice in writing of any resolution under subsection (1) is received by the Thames Borough Council, it shall, when making and levying the borough rates in respect of the rating year specified in the resolution, make, levy, and collect on behalf of the Board every rate referred to in the resolution:
    
    provided that where in respect of any such rate a maximum amount is prescribed by the said Act, the rate so made, levied, and collected by the Council shall not exceed the maximum amount so prescribed.
    
    (3) Every rate made and levied by the Thames Borough Council pursuant to this section shall be deemed to have been lawfully made and levied in all respects as if it had been made and levied pursuant to a direction contained in a special order under [section 95][11] of the Soil Conservation and Rivers Control Act 1941, and in so making and levying the rate the Council shall be deemed to have complied with any such special order made by the Hauraki Catchment Board, in respect of that rating year, after the passing of the resolution referred to in this section.

##### 3 Preventing granting of mining privileges over the surface of certain land
    
*   (1) From the date of the passing of this Act no mining privilege shall, without the prior consent of the Thames Borough Council, be granted or created under the provisions of the Mining Act 1926 over the surface of any part of the land described in the [Schedule][10] or within a distance of 50 feet from the surface of that part, so long as that part continues to be vested in the Council.
    
    (2) The District Land Registrar shall enter on the register and on every certificate of title issued to the Council in respect of the said land a memorandum stating that the reservations as to minerals therein are subject to the provisions of this section.

##### 4 Authority for District Land Registrar to remove trust provisions from title

##### 5 Power to sell or lease lands held on trust and to apply proceeds for Council purposes

    provided that no portion of the said land situated below high-water mark shall be so sold or transferred except with the prior consent of the Minister of Marine:
    
    provided also that nothing in this section shall derogate from the provisions of the Servicemen's Settlement and Land Sales Act 1943\.

##### 6 Application of Municipal Corporations Act 1933
    
*   The powers conferred by this Act on the Thames Borough Council are additional to those conferred by the Municipal Corporations Act 1933, and the provisions of that Act shall, so far as the same are applicable, apply to the exercise by the Thames Borough Council of the powers hereby conferred as if the powers hereby conferred had been conferred by that Act.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Thames Borough Council Empowering Act 1949\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 12 October 1949, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][14] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][15] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][16] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][17] and [17E][18] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
