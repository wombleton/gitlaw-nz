##### 18 Claims by beneficiaries against company
    
*   (1) Except with the consent of the High Court, no person who has or had a beneficial interest in property or funds at any time administered by any trustee company or associated company to which this Act applies (any such person being hereafter in this section referred to as a **beneficiary**) shall bring or maintain any action or other legal proceedings against the trustee company or associated company in respect of any breach or alleged breach of trust arising before the commencement of the application of this Act to that trustee company or associated company.
    
    (2) Subject to any directions that may be given by the High Court, it shall be the duty of the board to investigate the affairs of any trustee company or associated company to which this Act applies to ensure that its business has been conducted in a lawful manner.
    
    (3) If the board is satisfied that any such trustee company or associated company has been in breach of its fiduciary duties and it is satisfied that there is a common question of law or of fact affecting the several rights of all or any of the beneficiaries and a common relief is sought, it may bring an action or other legal proceedings in the name of the company against the company on behalf of all such beneficiaries and it shall not be necessary to make those beneficiaries parties to or join them in the action.
    
    (4) Any proceedings brought under this section may claim relief in respect of 1 or more causes of action.
    
    (5) In the conduct of proceedings to which this section applies, the High Court may make such orders as are appropriate for all or any of the following purposes:

    *   (b) determining the course of proceedings:
    
    *   (c) prescribing measures to prevent undue repetition or complication in the presentation of evidence or argument:
    
    *   (d) requiring, for the protection of the beneficiaries or otherwise for the fair conduct of the action, that notice be given to any person of the action, and the proposed extent or effect of the judgment:
    
    *   (e) consenting to other persons intervening and presenting claims or defences or otherwise coming into the action on such conditions as the court thinks just:
    
    *   (f) dealing with other procedural matters.
    
    (5A) Where the court is satisfied that the amount that could be recovered under a judgment given against a company under this section would be more than the net worth of the company, the court may at any time (whether at the time the judgment is given or thereafter) make an order determining that the maximum amount that can be recovered under the judgment is the amount that the court considers is the net worth of the company as a going concern (including any unpaid capital and any other amount liable to be contributed by the shareholders to the company in the event of the winding up thereof).
    
    (6) Every judgment given in an action brought under this section shall be final and binding on every beneficiary as if he had brought the action in his own name.
    
    (7) Where any judgment has been given under this section (whether before or after the commencement of the Trustee Companies Management Amendment Act 1987), the board shall so far as practicable settle a list of beneficiaries entitled to participate to the extent of $100 or more in the amount recovered under the judgment and their respective amounts.
    
    (7A) For the purpose of settling a list of beneficiaries so entitled, the board may, if it thinks fit, advertise for claims by beneficiaries; and in any such case the board shall not be required to include in the list any beneficiary who has not lodged a claim with the board within such period after the date of the last publication of the advertisement as shall be fixed by the court unless the board has funds recovered under the judgment that are available for distribution to beneficiaries and is satisfied that there is reasonable excuse for the failure to lodge a claim within that period.
    
    (7B) If the amounts of the entitlements of beneficiaries exceed the amount recovered under the judgment, those amounts shall reduce rateably.
    
    (7C) The board shall not advertise for claims under subsection (7A) unless the court has approved the form and content of the advertisements, the manner of advertising, and the dates of publication.
    
    (7D) The board shall not be required to calculate the exact amount of the entitlement of a beneficiary under this section but may calculate the amount of the entitlement as near to the exact amount as the board considers reasonable having regard to the amount of the claim and the costs involved in its calculation.
    
    (8) If any balance of the amount payable under the judgment remains undistributed, that balance shall be paid or applied for charitable purposes in accordance with a scheme prepared by the board and approved by the court.
    
    (9) Any such scheme prepared by the board shall be submitted to the High Court for approval with notice to such persons as that court directs.
    
    (10) The High Court may, after hearing the board and such other persons to whom notice has been given, approve such scheme as in its opinion is fair and just having regard to all the circumstances.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Trustee Companies Management Act 1975\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 July 2013, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][48] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][49] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][50] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][51] and [17E][52] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
