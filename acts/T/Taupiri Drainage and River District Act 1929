##### 3 Provision for constitution of Taupiri Drainage and River District
    
*   (1) As soon as practicable after the passing of this Act the Minister shall publish in the _Gazette_, and in one or more newspapers circulating in the locality, a notice containing an approximate description of the boundaries of the Taupiri Swamp, and such other particulars as may appear to him to be relevant, and shall in the said notice indicate that it is proposed to constitute the area so described a district for land-drainage and river-protection purposes, to be known as the Taupiri Drainage and River District; and shall call upon all persons affected to lodge written objections to or petitions against the proposal within one month from the first publication of the said notice.
    
    (2) No person other than a person having an interest in any land comprised in the area described in the said notice shall be entitled to lodge any objection to or petition against the proposal, and the only ground on which any person so entitled may lodge an objection or petition shall be either that the land in which he is interested does not and is not likely at any time to drain into the Mangawara River or its tributaries, or that such land has no community of interest with any other lands forming part of the Taupiri Swamp in respect of land-drainage or river-protection.
    
    (3) Any local authority may lodge objections to or petitions against the proposal on the ground that any lands included in the area described in the said notice should not be so included, or that any lands not included in such area should be included therein.
    
    (4) On the expiration of such period of one month the Governor-General may by Order in Council constitute the area described in the said notice, or any area substantially the same as that area, a district for the purposes of this Act, and he may leave the district undivided, or he may divide it into subdivisions with such names and boundaries as he assigns thereto; or he may appoint a Commission under the [Commissions of Inquiry Act 1908][29], to inquire and report to him whether the area described in the said notice or any other area (either a greater or a lesser area) should be constituted a district for the purposes of this Act, whether the district so constituted should be undivided or should be divided into subdivisions, and, if divided into subdivisions, to recommend suitable names and boundaries for such subdivisions.
    
    (5) On the receipt of the report of such Commission the Governor-General may by Order in Council constitute the area recommended by the Commission a district for the purposes of this Act, and, if the Commission so recommends, he may divide such district into not more than twelve subdivisions, with such names and boundaries as are recommended by the Commission.
    
    (6) The district so constituted shall be called the Taupiri Drainage and River District, and shall be deemed to be a drainage district within the meaning of the [Land Drainage Act 1908][25], duly constituted under that Act; and all the provisions of that Act, except in so far as they are inconsistent with the provisions of this Act, shall apply to such district accordingly.

##### 4 Taupiri Drainage and River Board
    
*   (1) The Governor-General may, in the Order in Council constituting the district or in any subsequent Order in Council, fix the number of members to comprise the Board of the Taupiri District, but so that there shall be not less than five nor more than twelve members of the Board.
    
    (2) If the district is divided into subdivisions, the Governor-General may in like manner fix the number of members to represent each subdivision, but so that there shall be not less than one nor more than five members for any subdivision.

##### 5 Powers of Board
    
*   The Taupiri Board, in addition to the powers conferred on it by the [Land Drainage Act 1908][25], shall have and may exercise, for the purpose of protecting lands in the district from flooding by the overflow of or the breaking of the banks of any river within the district, all the powers exercisable by a duly constituted River Board under the [River Boards Act 1908][24], for the protection of lands in a river district, including rating powers under the [Local Government (Rating) Act 2002][30].
    
    Section 5 was amended, as from 1 April 1989, by omitting the words ""the power to make and levy rates under that Act"" and substituting the words ""rating powers pursuant to sections 47 to 51 of the Rating Powers Act 1988"".
    
    Section 5 was amended, as from 1 July 2003, by section [137(1)][31] Local Government (Rating) Act 2002 (2002 No 6) by substituting the words ""under the Local Government (Rating) Act 2002"" for the words ""pursuant to sections 47 to 51 of the Rating Powers Act 1988"". _See_ section [137(2)][31] of that Act as to the savings provision that provides that the changes apply for the purpose of rating in a financial year that begins on or after 1 July 2003\.

    (5) The Commission shall report its decision to the Minister, who shall give notice thereof in the _Gazette_, and shall transmit a copy of the report of the Commission to the Taupiri Board.

    Subsection (3) was repealed, as from 1 July 2003, by section [262][26] Local Government Act 2002 (2002 No 84). _See_ sections [273 to 314][27] of that Act as to the savings and transitional provisions.

##### 13 Classification of lands before loan poll taken
    
*   (1) Before a poll of ratepayers is taken upon a proposal to raise a special loan as aforesaid, or, where several such polls are proposed to be taken, before the first of such polls is taken, the provisions of this and the next succeeding section shall be complied with.
    
    (2) The Board shall appoint one or more fit persons to examine and classify separately in each separate area all lands in the district, and the classification with respect to each such area shall be made without reference to lands of the district outside such area.
    
    (3) The lands within each separate area shall be classified according to---
        
    *   (a) The degree of benefit, direct or indirect, to be received or likely to be received from the carrying-out of the works; or
    
    *   (b) The degree (if any) to which any works theretofore carried out for the artificial drainage of any such lands has made it necessary to provide to a greater extent than would otherwise be required for the drainage of other lands in the separate area;
    
    or, as the case may require, according to both such considerations; and where, in the opinion of the persons making such classification, any land in the separate area will not benefit or be likely to benefit as aforesaid, and has not been artificially drained so as to require provision to be made as aforesaid for the drainage of other lands in the separate area, such land shall be placed in a separate class.
    
    (4) The said persons shall also name with respect to each separate area the proportions in which the special rate to be made and levied in respect of such loan shall be imposed on the several classes into which the lands in such area have been classified; but lands classified in the separate class referred to in the last preceding subsection shall not be liable to bear any proportion of the rate.
    
    (5) Every classification so made with respect to each separate area shall be set out in a list to be signed by the Chairman of the Board at a meeting thereof, which list shall also contain a statement of the proportions in which the special rate is to be imposed on the several classes; and the Board shall forthwith cause to be given public notice of all such classifications and of the said proportions, and of the place where the lists may be inspected for a period of twenty-one days, and of the right of appeal hereinafter conferred.
    
    (6) For the purposes of a classification to be made under the foregoing provisions of this section, the scheme of classification shall provide for six classes of lands liable to be rated for the purposes of any works, and for one class of land to be exempt from liability for rates. The said classes shall be respectively designated as Class A, Class B, Class C, Class D, Class E, Class F, and Class G.

##### 14 Appeal against classification and fixing of proportions in which special rate is to be borne
    
*   (1) Any person aggrieved by any such classification or by the fixing of the proportions in which the special rate is to be borne by the various classes may appeal against the same on the grounds following, and on no other grounds:---
        
    *   (a) That the classification does not fairly classify the land of the appellant:
    
    *   (b) That any land liable to be classified is omitted from the classification or is not fairly classified:
    
    *   (c) That any land is improperly included within or excluded from the area to which the classification relates:
    
    *   (d) That the proportions in which the special rate is proposed to be levied on the several classes do not fairly represent the relationship of the several classes to one another, or that the proportion of the rate imposed on any particular class or classes is too great or too small.
    
    (2) In the case of an appeal as aforesaid, a notice of appeal setting out the grounds thereof shall, before or within seven days after the expiration of the twenty-one days appointed for the inspection of the classification lists, be given to the Clerk of the District Court nearest to the office of the Board, and a copy thereof shall within the same period be lodged at the office of the Board. All objections so given shall forthwith be forwarded to the Minister by the Clerk of the Court.
    
    (3) The appeal shall be heard by a Commission appointed by the Governor-General, and consisting of such number of persons as he thinks fit, at such convenient time and place as the Commission appoints, of which not less than seven days' notice shall be given to the Board and to the appellant.
    
    (4) On the hearing of any such appeal the Commission may cause the appropriate classification list, or the statement therein of the proportions in which the rate is to be levied, to be amended in such manner as it thinks reasonable, and the Commission shall sign the list and the statement of proportions as so amended, and the decision of the Commission shall be final and conclusive.
    
    (5) The Board or any member or officer thereof authorized in that behalf by the Board shall have the same right of appeal as any person.
    
    The words ""District Court"" was substituted, as from 1 April 1980, for the words ""Magistrates Court"" pursuant to section [18(1)][33] District Courts Amendment Act 1979 (1979 No 125).

##### 15 Signed list to be sufficient evidence of classification
    
*   Every classification list signed by the Chairman of the Board, or signed by the Commission in the case of any such appeal as aforesaid, shall for all purposes be sufficient evidence of such classification and proportions as aforesaid having been duly made and fixed.

##### 16 Number of votes that ratepayer may exercise at loan poll
    
*   (1) The number of votes that may be exercised by any ratepayer at a poll upon a proposal to raise a loan under the authority conferred by this Act shall, subject to the provisions of the [Land Drainage Act 1908][25], as to disqualification of ratepayers from voting, be determined as follows:---

    (2) For the purposes of this section the value of any land in respect of which any person claims to be entitled to vote shall be ascertained as follows:---
        
    *   (a) The value of any land in any separate area classified as Class A land in accordance with section [thirteen][14] hereof shall be deemed to be the rateable value of that land (within the meaning of the Rating Powers Act 1988) as appearing on the valuation roll of the district:
    
    *   (b) The value of any land classified as aforesaid as Class B land shall be deemed to be five-sixths of the rateable value as aforesaid:
    
    *   (c) The value of any land classified as aforesaid as Class C land shall be deemed to be four-sixths of the rateable value as aforesaid:
    
    *   (d) The value of any land classified as aforesaid as Class D land shall be deemed to be three-sixths of the rateable value as aforesaid:
    
    *   (e) The value of any land classified as aforesaid as Class E land shall be deemed to be two-sixths of the rateable value as aforesaid:
    
    *   (f) The value of any land classified as aforesaid as Class F land shall be deemed to be one-sixth of the rateable value as aforesaid.
    
    (3) Land classified as aforesaid as Class G land shall be deemed not to be rateable property for the purposes of this section.
    
    (4) Where any person is entitled to vote by virtue of being the occupier of lands of more than one class, the number of votes that he may exercise shall be determined in accordance with the total value of all such lands as ascertained in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this section.
    
    The words ""two thousand dollars"" and ""four thousand dollars"" were substituted, as from 10 July 1967, for the words ""one thousand pounds"" and ""two thousand pounds"" pursuant to section [7(1)][34] Decimal Currency Act 1964 (1964 No 27).
    
    The Rating Act 1925 (1925 No 30) was substituted, as from 1 April 1968, by a reference to the Rating Act 1967 pursuant to section 177(1) Rating Act 1967 (1967 No 123). That reference was in turn substituted, as from 28 June 1988, by a reference to the Rating Powers Act 1988 pursuant to section 209(1) Rating Powers Act 1988 (1988 No 97).

##### 17 Special rate to meet annual and other loan charges to be made and levied separately in each separate area
