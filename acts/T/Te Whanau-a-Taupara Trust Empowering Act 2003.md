*   #### Preamble
    
    *   (1) The Taupara whanau gifted a block of land, ""Waerenga-a-hika"", as described in [Schedule 1][24], to the Crown by deed dated 9 April 1857 for the purpose of establishing an educational trust:
    
    *   (2) The Crown gifted the lands to George Augustus Selwyn, Lord Bishop of New Zealand, who, by deed of conveyance dated 28 April 1862, passed the Waerenga-a-hika lands upon trust to the Right Reverend William Williams, Bishop of Waiapu; the Reverend William Leonard Williams, of Turanga, Clerk; Ihaia te Noti, Poihipi te Rohe, Henare Kepa Ruru, Wiremu Pere, Matina Ruta Toti, Pita te Huhu, and Te Teira Kupa, all of Turanga, for a school for Maori in connection with the Anglican Church:
    
    *   (3) The school was destroyed by fire in 1937 and the trust funds were insufficient to rebuild the school:
    
    *   (4) The Waerenga-a-hika Trust Act 1947 was enacted to extend and vary the trusts and to establish a new board to administer the amended trusts:
    
    *   (5) The main object of the trust is to provide scholarships for the post-primary education, firstly of children of the Whanau-a-Taupara section of the Mahaki Tribe, and secondly for children of other sections of that tribe:
    
    *   (6) The objects of the trust provide that half of the trust's income must be put towards scholarships at schools conducted by the Church of England and that in all other cases preference must be given to schools conducted by the Church of England:
    
    *   (7) The Anglican Church and the Waerenga-a-hika Trust Board have successfully worked together for many years providing schooling, and educational support and opportunities, to children of the Mahaki Tribe:
    
    *   (8) It is difficult for the Waerenga-a-hika Trust Board to fulfil its objects, and children must travel further afield than the Gisborne area to boarding schools to take up their scholarships:
    
    *   (9) The powers of the trustees are restrictive and require all leases of land to be in accordance with the [Public Bodies Leases Act 1969][26]:
    
    *   (10) The trustees desire to---
            
        *   (a) widen the charitable and educational objects of the trust and widen the powers of the trustees under a new trust; and
        
        *   (b) ameliorate the restrictive conditions imposed on the Trust by virtue of the [Public Bodies Leases Act 1969][26]:
        
        
    
    *   (11) The trustees have executed a deed of trust known as the Te Whanau-a-Taupara Trust, as set out in [Schedule 2][25]:
    
    *   (12) The objects of this Act cannot be attained otherwise than by legislation.
    
    

##### 1 Title
    
*   This Act is Te Whanau-a-Taupara Trust Empowering Act 2003\.

##### 2 Commencement
    
*   This Act comes into force on the 28th day after the date on which it receives the Royal assent.

##### 3 Purpose
    
*   The purpose of this Act is---
    
    *   (a) to dissolve the Waerenga-a-hika Trust Board constituted by the Waerenga-a-hika Trust Act 1947 and to vest the assets of that trust in the trustees of Te Whanau-a-Taupara Trust as established by the trust deed dated 30 October 2001, a copy of which is set out in [Schedule 2][25]; and
    
    *   (b) to extinguish previous trusts; and
    
    *   (c) to modify, for the period specified in [section 6][7], the application (in relation to the purposes of the trusts declared by the trust deed) of the public benefit requirement of the law relating to charitable trusts; and
    
    *   (d) to limit the application of the [Public Bodies Leases Act 1969][26].
    
    

##### 4 Interpretation
    
*   In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,---
    
    _beneficiaries_ means the persons who, under clause 2 of the trust deed, are beneficiaries of the Te Whanau-a-Taupara Trust; and **beneficiary** has a corresponding meaning
    
    _Board_ means the Waerenga-a-hika Trust Board established by the Waerenga-a-hika Trust Act 1947
    
    _Te Whanau-a-Taupara Trust_ means Te Whanau-a-Taupara Trust established by the trust deed
    
    _trust deed_ means the trust deed dated 30 October 2001, a copy of which is set out in [Schedule 2][25]
    
    _trustees_ means the trustees for the time being of Te Whanau-a-Taupara Trust.

##### 5 Act binds the Crown
    
*   This Act binds the Crown.

##### 6 Blood ties

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][39] and [17E][40] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
