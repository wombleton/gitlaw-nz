The Parliament of New Zealand enacts as follows:

##### 1 Title
    
*   This Act is the Te Urewera Act 2014\.

##### 2 Commencement
    
*   This Act comes into force on the day after the date on which it receives the Royal assent.

## Part 1  
Te Urewera

#### 

### Subpart 1---Background, purpose, and principles

##### 3 Background to this Act
    
*   ###### Te Urewera
    
    (1) Te Urewera is ancient and enduring, a fortress of nature, alive with history; its scenery is abundant with mystery, adventure, and remote beauty.
    
    (2) Te Urewera is a place of spiritual value, with its own mana and mauri.
    
    (3) Te Urewera has an identity in and of itself, inspiring people to commit to its care.
    
    ###### Te Urewera and Tūhoe
    
    (4) For Tūhoe, Te Urewera is Te Manawa o te Ika a Māui; it is the heart of the great fish of Maui, its name being derived from Murakareke, the son of the ancestor Tūhoe.
    
    (5) For Tūhoe, Te Urewera is their ewe whenua, their place of origin and return, their homeland.
    
    (6) Te Urewera expresses and gives meaning to Tūhoe culture, language, customs, and identity. There Tūhoe hold mana by ahikāroa; they are tangata whenua and kaitiaki of Te Urewera.
    
    ###### Te Urewera and all New Zealanders
    
    (7) Te Urewera is prized by other iwi and hapū who have acknowledged special associations with, and customary interests in, parts of Te Urewera.
    
    (8) Te Urewera is also prized by all New Zealanders as a place of outstanding national value and intrinsic worth; it is treasured by all for the distinctive natural values of its vast and rugged primeval forest, and for the integrity of those values; for its indigenous ecological systems and biodiversity, its historical and cultural heritage, its scientific importance, and as a place for outdoor recreation and spiritual reflection.
    
    ###### Tūhoe and the Crown: shared views and intentions
    
    (9) Tūhoe and the Crown share the view that Te Urewera should have legal recognition in its own right, with the responsibilities for its care and conservation set out in the law of New Zealand. To this end, Tūhoe and the Crown have together taken a unique approach, as set out in this Act, to protecting Te Urewera in a way that reflects New Zealand's culture and values.
    
    (10) The Crown and Tūhoe intend this Act to contribute to resolving the grief of Tūhoe and to strengthening and maintaining the connection between Tūhoe and Te Urewera.

##### 4 Purpose of this Act
    
*   The purpose of this Act is to establish and preserve in perpetuity a legal identity and protected status for Te Urewera for its intrinsic worth, its distinctive natural and cultural values, the integrity of those values, and for its national importance, and in particular to---
        
    *   (a) strengthen and maintain the connection between Tūhoe and Te Urewera; and
    
    *   (b) preserve as far as possible the natural features and beauty of Te Urewera, the integrity of its indigenous ecological systems and biodiversity, and its historical and cultural heritage; and
    
    *   (c) provide for Te Urewera as a place for public use and enjoyment, for recreation, learning, and spiritual reflection, and as an inspiration for all.
    
    

##### 5 Principles for implementing this Act
    
*   (1) In achieving the purpose of this Act, all persons performing functions and exercising powers under this Act must act so that, as far as possible,---
        
    *   (a) Te Urewera is preserved in its natural state:
    
    *   (b) the indigenous ecological systems and biodiversity of Te Urewera are preserved, and introduced plants and animals are exterminated:
    
    *   (c) Tūhoetanga, which gives expression to Te Urewera, is valued and respected:
    
    *   (d) the relationship of other iwi and hapū with parts of Te Urewera is recognised, valued, and respected:
    
    *   (e) the historical and cultural heritage of Te Urewera is preserved:
    
    *   (f) the value of Te Urewera for soil, water, and forest conservation is maintained:
    
    *   (g) the contribution that Te Urewera can make to conservation nationally is recognised.
    
    (2) In achieving the purpose of this Act, all persons performing functions and exercising powers under this Act must act so that the public has freedom of entry and access to Te Urewera, subject to any conditions and restrictions that may be necessary to achieve the purpose of this Act or for public safety.

    *   (b) in any case where the application includes an area or areas around the structure or facility,---
            
        *   (i) either---
                
            *   (A) it is necessary for the purposes of safety or security of the site, structure, or facility to include any area or areas (including any security fence) around the structure or facility; or

    *   (b) there are no adequate or reasonable methods for remedying, avoiding, or mitigating the adverse effects of the activity, structure, or facility.
    
    (2) The Board may decline an application, whether or not it is provided for in the management plan, if the Board considers that the effects of the activity are such that a review of the management plan would be more appropriate.

##### 15 Mandatory conditions
    
*   (1) Every concession document must include (and is to be treated as including) a condition that the person in whose favour the concession is granted (the _concessionaire_) must act in accordance with the management plan, whether the plan or any amendment to it was approved before, on, or after the date on which the concession became effective.
    
    (2) A provision of a concession document that contravenes, or allows expressly or impliedly a contravention of, the management plan is of no effect.

    *   (b) the variation is necessary to deal with significant adverse effects of the activity that were not reasonably foreseeable at the time the concession was granted; or

    *   (c) the chief executive or the Director-General may, if the owner of the dog is not known and cannot be identified, sell, destroy, or otherwise dispose of the dog after the expiry of 7 days after the date of the seizure of the dog as he or she thinks fit.
    
    (3) The sale, destruction, or other disposal of a dog under these provisions does not relieve a former owner of the dog of the liability to pay any fees incurred for the seizure, sustenance, and holding of the dog.
    
    (4) No offence is committed against [section 42][410] of the Dog Control Act 1996 if the chief executive or the Director-General holds or disposes of a dog under subclause (1)(b) in the case of a dog that ought to be, but is not, registered under that Act.
    
    (5) Except as provided in subclause (1)(c), nothing in [section 69][409] of the Dog Control Act 1996 affects or limits the provisions of this clause.

##### 20 Recovery of costs relating to dogs
    
*   (1) The reasonable costs of seizing, holding, maintaining, or destroying a dog under this Act is a debt due by the owner of the dog to the chief executive or the Director-General, whoever incurred the costs, and may be recovered from the owner of the dog.
    
    (2) The chief executive or the Director-General may, in his or her absolute discretion, refund or waive payment of all or part of a sum paid or required to be paid under this clause.

##### 21 Power of warranted officer to request information
    
*   (1) A warranted officer may, for the purposes of dog control in Te Urewera, request any person who is in Te Urewera and who appears to be in charge of a dog to give his or her name, address, and date of birth, and, if that person claims that he or she is not the owner of the dog, to state the name and address of the owner of the dog.
    
    (2) Every person commits an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $1,500 who, without reasonable excuse, fails or refuses to comply with a lawful request under subclause (1), or wilfully states a false name, address, or date of birth in response to a request.
    
    (3) A warranted officer who is a constable may arrest a person without a warrant if the warranted officer---
        
    *   (a) has good cause to suspect that an offence against subclause (2) has been committed by a person; and
    
    *   (b) has warned that person of the provisions of this subclause; and
    
    *   (c) has good cause to suspect that a further offence against subclause (2) has been committed by that person subsequent to the warning.
    
    

##### 22 Evidence in proceedings
    
*   (1) In proceedings for an offence against this Act, a certificate purporting to be signed by the chair of the Board to the effect that, on the date specified in the certificate, the defendant or other named person was not the holder of a dog control permit is, in the absence of proof to the contrary, sufficient evidence of the matter stated in the certificate.
    
    (2) Subclause (1) is subject to subclauses (4) and (5).
    
    (3) A copy of a licence or document granted or issued under this Act, which is certified correct by the chief executive or the Director-General or an officer authorised by either, is, in the absence of proof of the contrary, sufficient to prove the validity of the licence or other document in proceedings for an offence against [section 84][120].
    
    (4) For the purpose of this clause, the production of a certificate or copy of a document purporting to be signed by a person authorised under this clause to sign it is, in proceedings for an offence against [section 84][120], prima facie evidence of the certificate or copy without proof of the signature of the person appearing to have signed it.
    
    (5) The production of a certificate or copy of a document that is signed by the chief executive or the Director-General and which certifies that the land upon which any offence is alleged to have taken place was within Te Urewera is, in proceedings for an offence against [section 84][120], sufficient evidence that the land was within Te Urewera.

##### 23 Strict liability
    
*   (1) In a prosecution for an offence against [section 86][122], it is not necessary for the prosecution to prove that the defendant intended to commit an offence.
    
    (2) It is a defence in such a prosecution if the defendant proves---
        
    *   (a) that the defendant did not intend to commit the offence; and
    
    *   (b) that, in a case where it is alleged---
            
        *   (i) that anything required to be done was not done, the defendant took all reasonable steps to ensure that it was done; or
        
        *   (ii) that anything prohibited was done, the defendant took all reasonable steps to ensure that it was not done.
