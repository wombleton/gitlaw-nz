##### 8 Summary of historical account
    
*   (1) Although Tapuika did not sign the Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti o Waitangi), from the 1840s to the early 1860s they sought to work with the Crown in the administration of their district. During this time, Māori customary law largely continued to prevail.
    
    (2) In 1864, Crown forces and Māori allies blocked a Kīngitanga taua at Matatā that was intent on reaching the Waikato. At the ensuing battle of Kaokoaroa in April 1864, some Tapuika opposed the Crown. Tapuika were also among the warriors that defeated Crown troops at Gate Pā in April 1864 and they participated in the battle of Te Ranga in June 1864\.
    
    (3) The Crown regarded Māori who fought at Gate Pā and Te Ranga as rebels. Between 1865 and 1868, the Crown confiscated 290 000 acres of land around Tauranga. The Crown retained 50 000 acres and returned the remainder to Māori. However, Tapuika and other rebels who had not surrendered were generally excluded from this process and Tapuika were awarded none of the land they claimed.
    
    (4) Kenana, a Tapuika settlement, was the base for Pai Mārire religion affiliates who opposed the survey of the confiscated lands. Crown forces, using a scorched-earth policy, destroyed Kenana and the surrounding cultivations, as well as kāinga further inland. The Crown then ordered a military occupation of Tapuika land.
    
    (5) In the 1860s, the Crown established the Native Land Court and tasked it with converting customary title into title derived from the Crown. Tapuika had no alternative but to use the court if they wished to secure legal title to their lands.
    
    (6) In the early 1870s, Native Land Court operations and Crown land purchase activities caused tensions between Tapuika and other iwi over rights to land in the Maketū district. In 1875 the Native Minister, seeking to resolve the issue, drew a boundary across the takapū that conflicted with an earlier judgment of the Native Land Court. Tapuika were subsequently excluded from almost all their ancestral lands beyond that boundary---approximately 40 000 prized coastal acres. Tapuika, a coastal people, were left with no coastal lands.
    
    (7) In purchasing land, the Crown used pre-title advances, some of which were made to individuals of other iwi, and used outstanding debts to apply pressure to Tapuika. By 1900, Crown purchases had left Tapuika with approximately 10 000 acres of land. Title to this land had been fragmented by Native Land Court partition and succession processes, which also undermined the tribal structures of Tapuika.
    
    (8) In the twentieth century, the Crown took land from Tapuika for public works 80 times, including land taken in 1939 for a Native School. Rather than pay compensation, the Crown returned a smaller area that Tapuika had gifted to the Crown for another school in 1886\. In 1971, the Crown took land from within Kenana urupā in breach of the provisions of the Public Works Act 1928\.
    
    (9) For Tapuika, the waterways of their rohe are taonga. However, since the late nineteenth century, these waterways have been modified and polluted. As a result, Tapuika wāhi tapu have been destroyed, Tapuika's traditional sources of food and water have been compromised, and it has become increasingly difficult for Tapuika to maintain their customary relationships with their waterways.

##### 9 Acknowledgements
    
*   (1) The Crown acknowledges that it has failed to address until now the long-standing, deeply felt grievances of Tapuika. The Crown hereby recognises the legitimacy of the grievances of Tapuika, and makes the following acknowledgements.
    
    ###### War
    
    (2) The Crown acknowledges that,---
        
    *   (a) in the 1860s, Tapuika were drawn into wars that were not of their making. These conflicts had a divisive effect as individuals within Tapuika were compelled to align themselves with different sides in the conflict, as evidenced by their participation on both sides of the battle of Kaokaoroa in April 1864; and
    
    *   (b) members of Tapuika were attacked by Crown troops at Pukehinahina in April 1864, and suffered loss of life at Te Ranga in June 1864; and
    
    *   (c) the Crown was ultimately responsible for the outbreak of war in Tauranga in 1864 and the resulting loss of life, and thus breached the Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti o Waitangi) and its principles.
    
    ###### Raupatu
    
    (3) The Crown acknowledges that its 1868 extension of the Tauranga confiscation boundary compulsorily extinguished any customary interests in that land, including those of Tapuika, and this was a breach of the Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti o Waitangi) and its principles.
    
    (4) The Crown also acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) the process for returning such land was ad hoc, slow, and arbitrary in nature; and
    
    *   (b) Tapuika were rebels who had not surrendered at the time the lands were returned; and
    
    *   (c) as rebels who had not surrendered, Tapuika were generally excluded from the lands return process.
    
    (5) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) it inflicted a scorched-earth policy in its assaults on the Tapuika settlements of Kenana and Rangiuru near Te Puke during the 1867 bush campaign; and
    
    *   (b) the destruction of these settlements had a devastating and unnecessary impact on Tapuika and was a breach of the Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti o Waitangi) and its principles.
    
    ###### Native land laws
    
    (6) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) it did not consult with Tapuika about the introduction of the native land laws in the 1860s; and
    
    *   (b) the title determination process carried significant costs for Tapuika, including survey and court costs. These costs were a particularly heavy burden for Tapuika, given the length and number of hearings into blocks near Maketū and that some of these hearings took place outside the Tapuika rohe; and
    
    *   (c) the workings of the native land laws, in particular the awarding of land to individuals rather than to iwi or hapū and the enabling of individuals to deal with that land without reference to iwi or hapū, made the lands of Tapuika more susceptible to alienation. As a result, the traditional tribal structures, mana, and rangatiratanga of Tapuika were eroded. The Crown acknowledges that it failed to take adequate steps to protect these structures, and this was a breach of the Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti o Waitangi) and its principles.
    
    ###### Toa claims
    
    (7) The Crown acknowledges that Tapuika's deepest grievance arises from the Crown's handling of the toa claims. The Crown further acknowledges that its determination of a toa boundary within the Tapuika rohe in 1875---
        
    *   (a) exacerbated a customary tenure dispute arising from decisions of the Native Land Court and Crown land purchase operations and further alienated Tapuika from their kin; and
    
    *   (b) conflicted with an earlier judgment of the Native Land Court, which found that Tapuika were the customary owners of land within the boundary set by the Crown; and
    
    *   (c) influenced subsequent Native Land Court judgments to lands within the boundary; and
    
    *   (d) ultimately excluded Tapuika from title to approximately 40 000 acres of their ancestral coastal lands and some of their most sacred sites. This had a severe and lasting impact on the economic base and tino rangatiratanga of Tapuika.
    
    ###### Crown land purchase tactics
    
    (8) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) it failed to ensure that pre-title advances recorded as paid to Tapuika for the Paengaroa block were received by Tapuika and then insisted on receiving land in other blocks from Tapuika in return for those advances; and
    
    *   (b) it used outstanding debts to pressure Tapuika into selling land at Paengaroa; and
    
    *   (c) it used lease agreements and monopoly purchasing powers to facilitate the purchase of Tapuika land, and refused to accept Tapuika's 1876 request to withdraw from a lease for Rangiuru while maintaining monopoly purchasing powers over the block; and
    
    *   (d) its monopoly purchasing powers prevented Tapuika selling Rangiuru for a significantly higher price to private parties than the price paid by the Crown; and
    
    *   (e) the combined effect of these aggressive purchase techniques meant that the Crown failed to act in good faith or protect actively the interests of Tapuika in land they wished to retain and this was a breach of the Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti o Waitangi) and its principles.
    
    ###### Public works takings
    
    (9) The Crown acknowledges that in 1888 Tapuika gifted the Crown 3 acres of land near Te Matai for a Native School. In 1939, the Crown used public works legislation to take 7.7 acres of land from Tapuika for a new school site. Instead of paying compensation, the Crown returned the smaller area of gifted land to Tapuika.
    
    (10) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) the Crown took land from within the Tapuika urupā at Kenana 3 times between 1917 and 1971 and that the urupā was in use by Tapuika when each of the takings occurred; and
    
    *   (b) Tapuika did not consent to any of these takings and were deeply distressed by them; and
    
    *   (c) the urupā, which is still in use today, is now divided in two by a highway and an adjacent railway line; and
    
    *   (d) the third taking, in 1971, was found by the Māori Land Court to be in breach of the Public Works Act 1928\. The Crown acknowledges that the 1971 taking was also made in breach of the Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti o Waitangi) and its principles.
    
    ###### Waterways
    
    (11) The Crown acknowledges that Tapuika consider the Kaituna River and its tributaries as taonga of great significance, with their own mauri. For Tapuika, their relationships with the Kaituna River and its tributaries give rise to their responsibilities to protect the mana and mauri of the waterways and to exercise their tino rangatiratanga, mana whakahaere and kaitiakitanga in accordance with their tikanga. Their relationships with the waterways lie at the heart of their spiritual and physical well-being and their tribal identity and culture.
    
    (12) The Crown further acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) the modification, pollution, and degradation of the Kaituna River and its tributaries since the 1890s have drained resource-rich wetlands, destroyed Tapuika wāhi tapu, caused significant harm to kaimoana sources relied on by Tapuika, compromised the traditional water supplies of Tapuika communities, and caused great anguish to Tapuika; and
    
    *   (b) the Crown has failed to respect, provide for, and protect the special relationship of Tapuika with the Kaituna River and its tributaries.
    
    

##### 10 Apology
    
*   (1) To the iwi of Tapuika, to the tūpuna, the descendants, the hapū and the whānau, the Crown now makes this apology. It is long overdue. Your grievances are acutely felt, and they go back generations. For too long the Crown has failed to find a way to respond to them appropriately.
    
    (2) The Crown is deeply sorry that it has not lived up to its obligations to Tapuika under Te Tiriti o Waitangi/the Treaty of Waitangi.
    
    (3) Beginning in the 1860s and continuing well into the twentieth century, the Crown's dealings with Tapuika have dishonoured the Treaty and its spirit.
    
    (4) In the 1860s Tapuika were swept up in the bitter tide of war, confiscation, and urupātu. From the 1870s, the native land laws and Crown land purchase operations compromised your rangatiratanga and facilitated the alienation of much of your rohe, Te Takapū o Tapuika. The line the Crown drew through your rohe in 1875 influenced subsequent decisions of the Native Land Court, which ultimately excluded Tapuika from title to your ancestral coastal lands and sacred sites.
    
    (5) In the twentieth century, the Crown took land from you that had been marked out as a resting place for your dead, not once but 3 times. The Crown sincerely and with deep remorse apologises for the trauma it thereby caused.
    
    (6) The waterways you live beside and cherish have, since the 1950s, been degraded and polluted. The Crown profoundly regrets the anguish this has caused for Tapuika, and failing to protect the special relationship Tapuika has with the Kaituna River and its tributaries.
    
    (7) Despite all these challenges, Tapuika have survived by holding fast to their whenua and their awa, their traditions and their identity. The Crown acknowledges the resilience and the unextinguished mana of Tapuika.
    
    (8) Through this apology, and this settlement, the Crown hopes to honestly confront the past and relieve the burden of grievance Tapuika has carried all these years. By the same means, the Crown hopes to forge a new relationship with the people of Tapuika, a relationship firmly founded on mutual trust, co-operation and respect for the Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti o Waitangi).
    
    ###### Tā te Karauna Whakapāha ki a Tapuika
    
    (1) Kei te iwi o Tapuika, kei ngā tūpuna, kei ngā uri, kei ngā hapū me ngā whānau, tēnei te Karauna te whakapāha atu nei. Kua takaroa rawa. E kai kinikini ana ō koutou mamae, ā, e hia kē whakatupuranga te roa. Kua roa ukauka kē te Karauna e kimi urupare tōtika ana, kihai i kitea.
    
    (2) Kāore te pāpōuri o te Karauna i te korenga ōna e whakaea i ngā herenga ki a Tapuika i raro i te Tiriti o Waitangi.
    
    (3) Kua takahia te Tiriti me tōna wairua e te Karauna me āna mahi ki a Tapuika mai anō i ngā tau 1860, ā, tae rawa ake ki te takapū o te rautau rua ngahuru.
    
    (4) I ngā tau 1860, i whawhati mai ki runga i a Tapuika te tai tūāuri o te matawhāura, o te murunga whenua me te urupatu. Mai anō i ngā tau 1870, i turakina tō koutou rangatiratanga e ngā ture whenua Māori me ngā mahi hoko whenua a te Karauna. Nā konei hoki te Karauna i huawaere te hokonga o te nuinga o tō koutou rohe, o Te Takapū o Tapuika. He kaha te pā o te rārangi i tuhia e te Karauna i te tau 1875 ki ā te Kōti Whenua Māori whakatau i whai iho, ā, ko tōna otinga atu ko te ngaromanga i a Tapuika o te mana ki ō koutou whenua kura i ngā pāpāringa o te moana, me ngā wāhi tapu hoki.
    
    (5) I te rautau rua ngahuru, i murua e te Karauna ō koutou whenua i whakatapua hei moenga roa mō ō koutou mate, kaua rā ko te murunga kotahi, engari kē ia e toru rawa. Kāore te kaniawhea i te Karauna e whakapāha tūturu nei mō ngā mate i pā.
    
    (6) Mai anō i ngā tau 1950, kua tāhawahawatia, kua whakaparuparutia hoki ngā wai a Parawhenuamea e noho ai koutou, e whakamaimoatia ai e koutou. E ngaukino ana te manawa pā i te Karauna i te auhī i pā ki a Tapuika, mōna i kore nei e taurima i te hononga motuhake o Tapuika ki te Awa Nui o Tapuika me ōna hikuwai.
    
    (7) Ahakoa ngā mātātaki huhua nei, nā te pūpuri pūmau ki tōna whenua, ki ōna awa, ki āna tikanga, ki tōna whakapapa hoki a Tapuika i takatū tonu ai i te mata o te whenua. E aumihi ana te Karauna ki te pūtohe me te mana tūmau o Tapuika.
    
    (8) Mā roto i tēnei whakapāha, e tūmanako ana te Karauna kia ea ngā mahi o mua, kia māriri hoki te mamae kua roa nei e ngaukino ana i a Tapuika. Mā konei anō hoki, e tūmanako ana te Karauna ki te whakawhirikoka i te taukaea hou i waenga i ngā uri o Tapuika, he taukaea e takea mai ana i te whakapono o tētehi ki tētehi, i te mahi ngātahi, i te whai koha ki Te Tiriti o Waitangi hoki.

    (3) The term of office of a chairperson is 3 years, unless the chairperson resigns or is removed by the Authority during that term.
    
    (4) The chairperson of the Authority may be reappointed or removed by the Authority.
    
    (5) The Authority must appoint a deputy chairperson and that appointment is subject to the same conditions as set out in subclauses (3) and (4).
    
    (6) The Authority may appoint subcommittees that the Authority considers appropriate, and [clause 30(4)][333] of Schedule 7 of the Local Government Act 2002 applies, except that a reference in that clause to a committee is to be read as a reference to the Authority.
    
    (7) [Clause 26(3) and (4)][376] of Schedule 7 of the Local Government Act 2002 do not apply to the Authority.

##### 2 Standing orders

    (2) The standing orders of the Authority---

    *   (a) all references to a local authority being read as references to the Authority; and
    
    *   (b) the reference in [clause 19(5)][379] to the chief executive being read as a reference to the chair of the Authority.
    
    (2) At the first meeting of the Authority, the Authority must adopt a schedule of meetings that it considers will enable it to discharge its functions.
    
    (3) The Authority must review the schedule from time to time to ensure that the Authority meets often enough to discharge its functions.
    
    (4) The quorum for a meeting of the Authority is---
        
    *   (a) the chairperson or deputy chairperson; and
    
    *   (b) 2 members appointed by the iwi appointing organisations; and

    (5) [Clauses 23(3)][382] and [30(9)(b)][333] of Schedule 7 of the Local Government Act 2002 do not apply to the Authority.

##### 4 Decision making
    
*   (1) The Authority must make its decisions by a vote at a meeting.
    
    (2) However, the members of the Authority must approach decision making in a manner that---
        
    *   (a) seeks to achieve consensus; and
    
    *   (b) is consistent with, and reflects, the purpose of the Authority; and
    
    *   (c) acknowledges as appropriate the interests of iwi in particular parts of the Kaituna River and its catchment.

    (4) The chairperson and deputy chairperson of the Authority may vote on any matter but do not have a casting vote.

*   (1) A member of the Authority who is interested in a matter relating to the Authority must disclose details of the interest to the Authority.
    
    (2) For the purposes of subclause (1), a member is _interested in a matter_ if he or she---
        
    *   (a) may derive a financial benefit from the matter; or

    *   (e) is otherwise directly or indirectly interested in the matter.
    
    (3) However, a person is not interested in a matter if his or her interest is so remote or insignificant that it cannot reasonably be regarded as likely to influence him or her in carrying out his or her responsibilities as a member of the Authority.
    
    (4) To avoid doubt, the affiliation of a member of the Authority with an iwi or a hapū that has customary interests over the river is not an interest that must be disclosed under subclause (1) or recorded under [clause 6][384].
    
    (5) In this section, _matter_ means---
        
    *   (a) the performance of the Authority's functions or the exercise of its powers; or

##### 7 Conflict of interest
    
*   A member of the Authority is not precluded by the [Local Authorities (Members' Interests) Act 1968][385] from discussing or voting on a matter merely because---
        
    *   (a) the member is also a member of a local authority; or
    
    *   (b) the member is a member of a relevant iwi or a hapū; or
    
    *   (c) the economic, social, cultural, and spiritual values of any iwi or hapū and their relationships with the Authority are advanced by or reflected in---
            
        *   (i) the subject matter under consideration; or
        
        *   (ii) any decision by or recommendation of the Authority; or
        
        *   (iii) participation in the matter by the member.
        
        
    
    

##### 8 Application of other statutory provisions
    
*   Despite [clause 19(2)][379] of Schedule 7 of the Local Government Act 2002, the members of the Authority appointed by iwi---
        
    *   (a) have the right to attend any meeting of the Authority; but
    
    *   (b) do not have the right to attend meetings of the local authorities by reason merely of their membership of the Authority.
