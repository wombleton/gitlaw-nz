    (2) Where a design, or the right to apply a design to any article, becomes vested, whether by assignment, transmission, or operation of law, in any person other than the original proprietor, either alone or jointly with the original proprietor, that other person, or, as the case may be, the original proprietor and that other person, shall be treated for the purposes of this Act as the proprietor of the design or as the proprietor of the design in relation to that article.

    provided that no proceedings shall be taken in respect of any infringement committed before the date on which the certificate of registration of the design under this Act is issued.

    Compare: 1921--22 No 18 s 53; 1939 No 26 s 69; Registered Designs Act 1949 s 4 (UK)

    (2) Regulations may be made under this Act for securing that the representation or specimen of a design in the case of which directions are given under this section shall not be open to inspection by the public during the continuance in force of the directions.
    
    (3) Where the Commissioner gives any such directions as aforesaid, he shall give notice of the application and of the directions to the Minister of Defence, and thereupon the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say:
        
    *   (a) the Minister of Defence shall, upon receipt of the notice, consider whether the publication of the design would be prejudicial to the defence of New Zealand, and, unless a notice under paragraph (c) has previously been given by the Minister of Defence to the Commissioner, shall reconsider that question before the expiration of 9 months from the date of filing of the application for registration of the design and at least once in every subsequent year:
    
    *   (b) for the purpose aforesaid, the Minister of Defence may, at any time after the design has been registered or, with the consent of the applicant, at any time before the design has been registered, inspect the representation or specimen of the design filed in pursuance of the application:
    
    *   (c) if upon consideration of the design at any time it appears to the Minister of Defence that the publication of the design would not, or would no longer, be prejudicial to the defence of New Zealand, the Minister of Defence shall give notice to the Commissioner to that effect:
    
    *   (d) on the receipt of any such notice the Commissioner shall revoke the directions and may, subject to such conditions, if any, as he thinks fit, extend the time for doing anything required or authorized to be done by or under this Act in connection with the application or registration, whether or not that time has previously expired.
    
    (4) No person resident in New Zealand shall, except under the authority of a written permit granted by or on behalf of the Commissioner, make or cause to be made any application outside New Zealand for the registration of a design of any class prescribed for the purposes of this subsection unless---
        
    *   (a) an application for registration of the same or substantially the same design has been made in New Zealand not less than 6 weeks before the application outside New Zealand; and
    
    *   (b) either no directions have been given under subsection (1) in relation to the application in New Zealand or all such directions have been revoked:
    
    provided that this subsection shall not apply in relation to a design for which an application for protection has first been filed in a country outside New Zealand by a person resident outside New Zealand.

##### 10 Provisions as to confidential disclosure, etc
    
*   (1) An application for the registration of a design shall not be refused, and the registration of a design shall not be invalidated, by reason only of,---
        
    *   (a) the disclosure of the design by the proprietor to any other person in such circumstances as would make it contrary to good faith for that other person to use or publish the design; or
    
    *   (b) the disclosure of the design in breach of good faith by any person other than the proprietor of the design; or
    
    *   (c) in the case of a new or original textile design intended for registration, the acceptance of a first and confidential order for goods bearing the design.

    *   (a) that a representation of the design, or any article to which the design has been applied, has been displayed, with the consent of the proprietor of the design, at an international or industrial exhibition declared as such by the Commissioner by notice in the Journal, whether the exhibition is held in New Zealand or elsewhere; or
    
    *   (b) that after any such display as aforesaid, and during the period of the exhibition, a representation of the design or any such article as aforesaid has been displayed by any person without the consent of the proprietor; or
    
    *   (c) that a representation of the design has been published in consequence of any such display as is mentioned in paragraph (a),---

    (2) Subject to the provisions of this Act and of subsection (3) of [section 7][87] of the Crown Proceedings Act 1950, the registration of a design shall have the same effect against the Crown as it has against a subject.

    (2) Unless in any action brought by virtue of this section the defendant proves that the acts in respect of which proceedings were threatened constitute or, if done, would constitute an infringement of the copyright in a registered design the registration of which is not shown by the plaintiff to be invalid, the plaintiff shall be entitled to the following relief, that is to say:
