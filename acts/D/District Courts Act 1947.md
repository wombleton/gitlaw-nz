##### 84I Effect of attachment orders
    
*   (1) An attachment order shall direct that the money due and payable under the judgment shall, by way of sums of such amount, and payable by reference to such earnings period, as is specified in the attachment order, be a charge on any salary or wages that from time to time while the attachment order remains in force become due and payable by the employer to the judgment debtor.
    
    (2) The charge so created---
        
    *   (a) shall accrue from earnings period to earnings period, and on such day of the earnings period as is specified in the attachment order; and
    
    *   (b) shall attach to all salary or wages that become due by the employer to the judgment debtor at any time while the attachment order is in force, whether or not the contract of employment in respect of which the salary or wages so become due existed at the date of the attachment order; and
    
    *   (c) shall be subject to any charge created by an attachment order under the [Family Proceedings Act 1980][368] or the [Summary Proceedings Act 1957][369] and to any item referred to in subsection (5)(a) and (b) (whether created, issued, or authorised before or after the date on which the order referred to in subsection (1) was made); but
    
    *   (d) shall prevail over and have priority to any assignment or charge created by the judgment debtor (whether before or after the making of the attachment order under this Act), and so that the attachment order shall have the same effect as if no such assignment or charge had been made or created by the judgment debtor.
    
    (3) Despite subsections (1) and (2), no attachment order is to operate so that, when its effect is considered either alone or with the effect of any item referred to in subsection (5), the net amount paid to a judgment debtor for an earnings period is below the protected earnings rate for the earnings period; and, where necessary, the amount to be deducted from the judgment debtor's salary or wages for the earnings period is treated as being reduced or cancelled accordingly.
    
    (4) Nothing in [section 84][370] of the Social Security Act 1964 applies to an attachment order.

    *   (b) a deduction for the recovery of payments under [section 86][373] of the Social Security Act 1964:
    
    *   (c) a charge created by an attachment order under this or any other Act.

    _protected earnings rate_, in relation to an earnings period, means the higher of---
        
    *   (a) 60% of net earnings for the earnings period; and

    (3) All sums so deducted shall be deemed to have been paid by the judgment debtor in satisfaction of the judgment debtor's liability to pay the judgment debt.
    
    (4) If the judgment debtor gives notice of resignation, or is given notice of dismissal, from the employment of the employer to whom the attachment order relates, the employer must, within 7 days after receiving or giving the notice, notify the person referred to in [section 84H(e)][153] of the date of the last day of the judgment debtor's employment.
    
    (4A) If the employer to whom the attachment order relates ceases to pay salary or wages to the judgment debtor for a reason other than the judgment debtor's dismissal or resignation from the employment of the employer, the employer must, within 7 days after ceasing to pay the salary or wages, notify the person referred to in [section 84H(e)][153] of the day on which the salary or wages ceased to be paid.
    
    (5) Where the employer makes default in the payment of any money in satisfaction of any such charge, that money shall become a debt due by the employer to the judgment creditor, and may be recovered by the judgment creditor by action in any court of competent jurisdiction.
