An Act to confer further powers upon the Dunedin City Corporation in respect of the supply of water to the suburbs of Dunedin
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    Whereas by an Act of the General Assembly of New Zealand intituled the Dunedin Waterworks Extension Act 1875 Amendment Act 1878 it was provided by section 4 thereof that the Corporation of any suburban borough should pay to the Corporation of the City of Dunedin (hereinafter called the _said Corporation_) in respect of water drawn from the Dunedin Waterworks or from any stream lawfully impounded by and transferred to the said Corporation for the purposes of the Dunedin Waterworks for the supply of the inhabitants of such suburban borough a sum not exceeding 6 pence for every 1 000 gallons of water so drawn:
    
    And whereas by the Dunedin Waterworks Extension Act 1901 the said Corporation was empowered (subject to the conditions therein set out) to construct certain further works with the object of conducting water to a higher level than that to which it was capable of being conducted by means of the waterworks then owned by the said Corporation:
    
    And whereas by such last-mentioned enactment the rights of boroughs under the Dunedin Waterworks Extension Act 1875 Amendment Act 1878 were preserved but were not to be deemed to extend to waterworks constructed under the provisions of the Dunedin Waterworks Extension Act 1901, or to any waterworks thereafter constructed by the said Corporation whereby water might be conducted to a higher level than that to which it was capable of being conducted by means of the waterworks then owned by the said Corporation:
    
    And whereas the only suburban boroughs which have not now amalgamated with the said city are the Boroughs of Saint Kilda, Green Island, and West Harbour:
    
    And whereas, in view of the magnitude of the waterworks carried out by the said Corporation and the greatly increased costs in connection therewith, it is proper and expedient that the said Corporation should be given authority to increase the rate or charges payable in respect of water supplied to the said boroughs and to review the rate or charges from time to time.

##### 1 Short Title
    
*   This Act may be cited as the Dunedin City (Suburban Water Charges) Empowering Act 1937\.

##### 2 Interpretation
    
*   In this Act _the said Corporation_ means the Mayor, Councillors, and Citizens of the City of Dunedin.

##### 3 Power to fix charges for water supplied to boroughs
    
*   (1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Act contained, it shall be lawful for the said Corporation to charge to the suburban boroughs of Saint Kilda, Green Island, and West Harbour aforesaid, and the Corporation of any of such suburban boroughs shall pay to the said Corporation, for and in respect of the water drawn from the Dunedin Waterworks or from any stream that is lawfully impounded by and transferred to the said Corporation for the purpose of the Dunedin Waterworks for the supply of the inhabitants of any of such suburban boroughs, such price as may from time to time be payable as provided in this section.
    
    (2) The price payable under this section for water drawn at any time after 1 October 1961 shall be 1 shilling and 6 pence a 1 000 gallons or such other price as may from time to time be mutually agreed upon between the said Corporation and the Council of any such suburban boroughs or, failing agreement, as may from time to time be fixed by arbitration under the Arbitration Act 1908 of 2 indifferent persons, one to be appointed by the said Corporation and one by such Council or Councils, and an umpire to be appointed by the arbitrators or by the Supreme Court in manner provided by the Arbitration Act 1908\.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Dunedin City (Suburban Water Charges) Empowering Act 1937\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 15 September 1961, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][6] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][7] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][8] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][9] and [17E][10] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
