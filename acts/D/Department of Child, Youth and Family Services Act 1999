##### 4 Application of employment contracts
    
*   
    
    
    
    (1) This section
    and [sections 5][7] and [6][8] apply to any transferred
    employee.
    
    
    (2) Unless a transferred
    employee's employment contract otherwise provides and subject to subsection
    (3), the transferred employee's employment contract continues to apply
    to that employee, on and from the date the employee transfers to the
    responsible department, on the same terms and conditions (including
    the period of the contract)---
    
    *   (a) as if it were a contract that had been
        made in respect of the responsible department; and
        
        
    
    
    
    *   (b) as if it were binding on both that employee
        and on the chief executive of the responsible department, and on any
        other party to that contract.
        
    
    
    
    
    (3) If there is
    a change to an employee's duties or location arising out of his or
    her transfer to the responsible department, the conditions of employment
    of that employee may be varied by agreement to reflect that change
    but the conditions of employment (as so varied) must be no less favourable
    than those that the employee was entitled to receive under the employment
    contract applying to the employee at the date of the transfer.
    
    
    (4) Subsections
    (2) and (3) continue to apply to the conditions of employment of each
    transferred employee to whom this section applies until such time
    as any of the conditions of employment that apply under the employment
    contract applying to that employee at the date of the transfer are
    subsequently varied (otherwise than for the purpose referred to in
    subsection (3)).
    
    
    (5) The conditions
    of employment of each such transferred employee are, on and from the
    date of any subsequent variation to which subsection (4) applies,
    to be determined in accordance with the employment contract applying
    to that employee in the responsible department.
    
    
    (6) Nothing in
    subsection (2) or subsection (3) continues to apply to any transferred
    employee who receives any subsequent appointment, whether within the
    responsible department or any other department.
    
    
    



##### 5 Employment to be continuous
    
*   
    
    
    
    For the purposes
    of any provisions of a transferred employee's employment contract
    relating to continuity of service, that employee's transfer from the
    Department of Social Welfare to the responsible department is insufficient
    by itself to break his or her employment.
    
    
    



##### 6 Transfer not sufficient to entitle employee to redundancy
or severance payment
    
*   
    
    
    
    No transferred
    employee is entitled to receive any compensation for redundancy or
    any severance payment because---
    
    *   (a) the position held by that employee in
        the Department of Social Welfare has ceased to exist; or
        
        
    
    
    
    *   (b) he or she has ceased by virtue of his
        or her transfer to be an employee of the Department of Social Welfare.
        
        
    
    
    
    
    




## Part 2  
Transfer of obligations and functions, and
other matters



##### 7 Transfers of contracts or leases not to give rise
to claims
    
*   
    
    
    
    (1) No person
    has any claim against the Crown for breach of any contract merely
    because the administration of the contract or the benefit or burden
    of the contract is transferred (in whole or in part) to the responsible
    department, whether or not the person has agreed to the transfer.
    
    
    (2) Subsection
    (1) applies whether or not the transfer involves the responsible department
    and its employees gaining access to any information, data, programme,
    intellectual property right, know-how, chattel, equipment, transmission
    device, or facility of the claimant or any other person.
    
    
    (3) No person
    has any claim against the Crown for breach of any lease of any premises
    which are to be occupied or administered (in whole or in part) by
    the responsible department merely because of that occupation or administration
    of the premises by the responsible department, whether or not the
    person has agreed to the occupation or administration of the premises.

    Welfare), the proceedings may be continued, completed, and enforced
    by or against the designated successor.
    
    
    (2) If, before
    the commencement of this Act, any person was entitled, or claimed
    to be entitled, to issue any proceedings, apply for or exercise any
    right of review, or to exercise any right of appeal, referred to in
    subsection (1),---
    
    *   (a) that person may, after the commencement
        of this Act, commence the proceedings, review, or appeal as if the
        designated successor were the appropriate person in respect of whom
        the proceedings, review, or appeal relates; and
        
        
    
    
    
    *   (b) the provisions of subsection (1) apply
        to any such proceedings, review, or appeal commenced under paragraph
        (a) as if they had been commenced prior to the commencement of this
        Act; and
        
    
    
    
    *   (c) no such proceedings, review, or appeal
        may be commenced in respect of any person other than the designated

##### Notes


###### 1 General
    
*   
    
    
    This is a reprint of the Department of Child, Youth and
    Family Services Act 1999\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments
    to the Act as at 1 July 2005, as specified in the list of amendments
    at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that have
    yet to come into force or that contain relevant transitional or savings
    provisions are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological
    order.
    



###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   
    
    
    Under [section 16D][57] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act
    1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the
    date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and
    by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even
    though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations
    Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official
    volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal
    enactment and its amendments are contained.
    



###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   
    
    
    A number of editorial conventions are followed in the
    preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included
    in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted.
    For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/
    or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts
    and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in
    Force_.
    



###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations
Publication Act 1989
    
*   
    
    
    [Section
    17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out
    in [sections 17D][58] and [17E][59] of that Act
    so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted
    enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice.
    Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January
    2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since
    1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of
    the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation
    reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation
    and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under
    the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act
    1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where
    relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
    
        
    *   
        
        •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   
        
        •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
        
    *   
        
        •layout of provisions, including:
        
            
        *   
            
            •indentation
        *   
            
            •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear
            above the section)
            
        
        
        
    *   
        
        •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type,
        without quotation marks)
    *   
        
        •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   
        
        •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page
        of each Act)
    *   
        
        •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
        
    *   
        
        •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals,
        and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   
        
        •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
        
            
        *   
            
            •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared
            with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are
            amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word
            (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
            
        *   
            
            •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now
            capital letters
            
        
        
        
    *   
        
        •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule),
        and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   
        
        •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
        
    *   
        
        •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules
        of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather
        than chronological).
