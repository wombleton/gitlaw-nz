            *   (A) such amounts as the Secretary determines would be reasonable amounts for administrative and selling costs, delivery charges, and other charges incurred in the sale; and
            
            *   (B) an amount calculated in accordance with such rate as the Secretary determines would be the rate of profit on that sale having regard to the rate of profit normally realised on sales of goods (where such sales exist) of the same general category in the domestic market of the country of export of the goods; or

    *   (a) at the same level of trade; and
    
    *   (b) in respect of sales made at as nearly as possible the same time; and

    (4) Where the normal value of goods exported to New Zealand is to be ascertained in accordance with subsection (2), the Secretary shall make such adjustments as are necessary to ensure that the normal value so ascertained is properly comparable with the export price of those goods.
    
    (5) Where---
        
    *   (a) the actual country of export of goods imported or intended to be imported into New Zealand is not the country of origin of the goods; and
    
    *   (b) the Secretary is of the opinion that the normal value of the goods should be ascertained for the purposes of this Act as if the country of origin were the country of export,---
    
    the Secretary may direct that the normal value of the goods shall be so ascertained.
    
    (6) Where the Secretary is satisfied, in relation to goods imported or intended to be imported into New Zealand, that---
        
    *   (a) the price paid for like goods---
            
        *   (i) sold for home consumption in the country of export in sales that are arm's length transactions; or
        
        *   (ii) sold in the country of export to a third country in sales that are arm's length transactions,---
        
        is, and has been for an extended period of time and in respect of a substantial quantity of like goods, less than the sum of---
            
        *   (iii) such amount as the Secretary determines to be the cost of production or manufacture of the like goods in the country of export; and
        
        *   (iv) such amounts as the Secretary determines to be reasonable amounts for administrative and selling costs, delivery charges, and other charges necessarily incurred in the sale of the like goods by the seller of the goods; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) it is likely that the seller of those like goods will not be able to fully recover the amounts referred to in subparagraphs (iii) and (iv) of paragraph (a) within a reasonable period of time,---
    
    the price so paid for those like goods shall be deemed not to have been paid in the ordinary course of trade.

    *   (d) the provision of goods or services, or the purchase of goods, by a foreign Government shall not be regarded as conferring a benefit, unless the goods or services are provided for less than adequate remuneration within the meaning of subsection (4), or the goods are purchased for more than adequate remuneration, as the case may be.

    *   (c) the extent to which the effect of the dumped or subsidised goods is or is likely significantly to depress prices for like goods of New Zealand producers or significantly to prevent price increases for those goods that otherwise would have been likely to have occurred:

    *   (a) there is insufficient evidence of dumping or subsidisation to justify proceeding with the investigation; or
    
    *   (b) there is insufficient evidence that material injury to a New Zealand industry has been or is being caused or is threatened or the establishment of a New Zealand industry has been or is being materially retarded by means of the dumping or subsidisation of the goods; or
    
    *   (c) in the case of subsidisation, the imposition of a countervailing duty in respect of those goods would be inconsistent with New Zealand's obligations as a party to the WTO Agreement; or
    
    *   (d) the application for the investigation has been withdrawn in writing by those New Zealand producers by or on whose behalf the application was made; or
    
    *   (e) New Zealand producers who previously expressed support for the application for the investigation have withdrawn that support in writing to such an extent that, by reason of [section 10(3)][16], the investigation could not have been initiated,---
    
    the Minister shall---
        
    *   (f) terminate the investigation with respect to those goods; and
    
    *   (g) give notice of such termination.

        *   (i) in the case of goods of Singaporean origin, less than 5% (expressed as a percentage of the export price); or
        
        *   (ii) in the case of goods of any other origin, less than 2% (expressed as a percentage of the export price); or
        
        
    
    *   (b) in the case of subsidisation, the amount of the subsidy is less than 1% of the value of the goods at the time of import; or
    
    *   (c) in the case of either dumping or subsidisation, the volume of imports of dumped or subsidised goods, expressed as a percentage of total imports of like goods into New Zealand, is negligible, having regard to New Zealand's obligations as a party to the WTO Agreement.
    
    (2A) For the purposes of subsection (2)(c), in applying Article 5.8 of the Agreement on the Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994, annexed to the WTO Agreement, in relation to goods of Singaporean origin,---
        
    *   (a) the first reference in Article 5.8 to ""3 per cent"" must be read as a reference to ""5 per cent""; and
    
    *   (b) accordingly, if the volume of goods of Singaporean origin dumped is found to account for less than 5% of the total imports of like goods into New Zealand, the volume of goods dumped must normally be regarded as negligible.

    *   (b) any investigation is terminated pursuant to an undertaking given by the Government of the country of export or by an exporter, as the case may be, under [section 15(1)][24] and that Government or that exporter violates that undertaking,---
    
    the Secretary may initiate a further investigation and all the provisions of this Act shall have effect accordingly.
    
    (4) Notice shall be given of the initiation of every further investigation under subsection (3).

    *   (b) by reason thereof material injury to an industry has been or is being caused or is threatened or the establishment of an industry has been or is being materially retarded.

    *   (a) in the case of dumped goods, not exceeding the difference between the export price of the goods and their normal value; and
    
    *   (b) in the case of subsidised goods, not exceeding the amount of the subsidy on the goods.
    
    (5) In exercising the discretion under subsection (4), the Minister shall have regard to the desirability of ensuring that the amount of anti-dumping or countervailing duty in respect of those goods is not greater than is necessary to prevent the material injury or a recurrence of the material injury or to remove the threat of material injury to an industry or the material retardation to the establishment of an industry, as the case may require.
    
    (6) The Secretary may initiate a reassessment of any rate or amount of anti-dumping or countervailing duty determined under subsection (4), including any elements of any formula used to establish such a rate or amount,---
        
    *   (a) on the initiative of the Secretary; or
    
    *   (b) where a request for a reassessment is submitted to the Secretary by an interested party who submits evidence justifying the need for a reassessment; or
    
    *   (c) following the completion of a review carried out under subsection (8)---
    
    and the Minister may determine a new rate or amount in accordance with subsection (4), and, in that event, shall give notice of the new rate or amount.
    
    (7) The Minister may, by notice, terminate, in whole or in part, the imposition of any anti-dumping or countervailing duty imposed under this section, with effect from the date specified in the notice, which date may be prior to the date of the notice.
    
    (8) The Secretary may, on his or her own initiative, and shall, where requested to do so by an interested party that submits positive evidence justifying the need for a review, initiate a review of the imposition of anti-dumping duty or countervailing duty in relation to goods and shall complete that review within 180 days of its initiation.
    
    (9) Anti-dumping duty or countervailing duty applying to any goods shall cease to be payable on those goods from the date that is the specified period after---
        
    *   (a) the date of the final determination made under [section 13][20] in relation to those goods; or
    
    *   (b) the date of notice of any reassessment of duty given under subsection (6), following a review carried out under subsection (8),---
    
    whichever is the later, unless, at that date, the goods are subject to review under subsection (8).
    
    (9A) In subsection (9), _specified period_ means,---
        
    *   (a) in the case of goods of Singaporean origin, 3 years; and
    
    *   (b) in the case of goods of any other origin, 5 years.
    
    (10) Without limiting the ability of the Minister to require refunds in other circumstances, where a reassessment under subsection (6) results in a lower duty being imposed on any goods, the Minister may require the Customs to refund, with effect from the date of initiation of the reassessment (or, in the case of a reassessment carried out under paragraph (c) of that subsection, from the date of initiation of the review referred to in that paragraph), the difference between the duty paid and the lower duty.
