## Schedule 1  
The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations

[s 3][5]

The States Parties to the present Convention,

Recalling that peoples of all nations from ancient times have recognized the status of diplomatic agents,

Having in mind the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations concerning the sovereign equality of States, the maintenance of international peace and security, and the promotion of friendly relations among nations,

Believing that an international convention on diplomatic intercourse, privileges and immunities would contribute to the development of friendly relations among nations, irrespective of their differing constitutional and social systems,

Realizing that the purpose of such privileges and immunities is not to benefit individuals but to ensure the efficient performance of the functions of diplomatic missions as representing States,

Affirming that the rules of customary international law should continue to govern questions not expressly regulated by the provisions of the present Convention,

Have agreed as follows:

## Article 1

For the purpose of the present Convention, the following expressions shall have the meanings hereunder assigned to them:
    
*   (a) the ""head of the mission"" is the person charged by the sending State with the duty of acting in that capacity;

*   (b) the ""members of the mission"" are the head of the mission and the members of the staff of the mission;

*   (c) the ""members of the staff of the mission"" are the members of the diplomatic staff, of the administrative and technical staff and of the service staff of the mission;

*   (d) the ""members of the diplomatic staff"" are the members of the staff of the mission having diplomatic rank;

*   (e) a ""diplomatic agent"" is the head of the mission or a member of the diplomatic staff of the mission;

*   (f) the ""members of the administrative and technical staff"" are the members of the staff of the mission employed in the administrative and technical service of the mission;

*   (g) the ""members of the service staff"" are the members of the staff of the mission in the domestic service of the mission;

*   (h) a ""private servant"" is a person who is in the domestic service of a member of the mission and who is not an employee of the sending State;

*   (i) the ""premises of the mission"" are the buildings or parts of buildings and the land ancillary thereto, irrespective of ownership, used for the purposes of the mission including the residence of the head of the mission.

## Article 2

The establishment of diplomatic relations between States, and of permanent diplomatic missions, takes place by mutual consent.

## Article 3
    
*   1\. The functions of a diplomatic mission consist _inter alia_ in:
        
    *   (a) representing the sending State in the receiving State;
    
    *   (b) protecting in the receiving State the interests of the sending State and of its nationals, within the limits permitted by international law;
    
    *   (c) negotiating with the Government of the receiving State;
    
    *   (d) ascertaining by all lawful means conditions and developments in the receiving State, and reporting thereon to the Government of the sending State;
    
    *   (e) promoting friendly relations between the sending State and the receiving State, and developing their economic, cultural and scientific relations.
    
    

*   2\. Nothing in the present Convention shall be construed as preventing the performance of consular functions by a diplomatic mission.

## Article 4
    
*   1\. The sending State must make certain that the _agrément_ of the receiving State has been given for the person it proposes to accredit as head of the mission to that State.

*   2\. The receiving State is not obliged to give reasons to the sending State for a refusal of _agrément_.

## Article 5
    
*   1\. The sending State may, after it has given due notification to the receiving States concerned, accredit a head of mission or assign any member of the diplomatic staff, as the case may be, to more than one State, unless there is express objection by any of the receiving States.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Diplomatic Privileges and Immunities Act 1968\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 25 January 2005, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][71] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][72] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][73] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][74] and [17E][75] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
