An Act to enable the Dilworth Trust Board to enter into an integration agreement under the [Private Schools Conditional Integration Act 1975][8]
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    Whereas the Dilworth Trust Board (hereinafter referred to as the Board) is incorporated as a Board pursuant to the provisions of the [Charitable Trusts Act 1957][9] and is trustee of the Trust as defined in [section 2][10] of the Dilworth Trustees Act 1967 and as varied first by that latter Act, and secondly, by the statutory provisions (as defined in [section 2][10] of that latter Act) and thirdly by order of the High Court dated 20 March 1981 made pursuant to [section 7][11] of that latter Act:
    
    And whereas the Board in terms of the Trust administers the Dilworth Ulster Institute more commonly known as the Dilworth School situated at Great South Road, Auckland:
    
    And whereas the said Board has entered into negotiations with the Minister of Education for the integration pursuant to the [Private Schools Conditional Integration Act 1975][8] of part of the Institute: 
    
    And whereas the terms of the Trust provide generally for the provision of education at the Institute for orphans or children from poor families normally resident in the Auckland Provincial District or the Province of Ulster in Northern Ireland: 
    
    And whereas in terms of [section 29(2)][12] of the Private Schools Conditional Integration Act 1975 no prospective pupil shall be refused enrolment at an integrated school on the ground of the pupil's socio-economic background and the Board and the Minister of Education are thereby prevented from entering into an integration agreement, notwithstanding anything contained in [section 7(3)][13] of the Private Schools Conditional Integration Act 1975:
    
    And whereas this matter can only be dealt with by legislation: And whereas it is desirable that the Minister and the Board be empowered in terms that preserve the basis of selection of pupils as specified in the terms of the Trust to enter into an integration agreement: 
    
    And whereas although [section 7(3)][13] of the Private Schools Conditional Integration Act 1975 otherwise empowers the Board to enter into an integration agreement, it is desirable and expedient that the Board be so specifically empowered.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Dilworth Trustees Empowering Act 1983\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 16 December 1983, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][15] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][16] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][17] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][18] and [17E][19] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
