An Act for enabling the Trustees of the Dunedin Garrison Hall to borrow Moneys for the Purpose of paying off Loans or Mortgages now or hereafter subsisting on the whole or any part of the Lands vested in the said Trustees, or the Rents, Issues, and Profits thereof, and to execute Mortgages for securing Payment of the Moneys so borrowed and Interest thereon.
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    WHEREAS the said Trustees or their predecessors in office have, in pursuance of the powers vested in them, borrowed on the security of the rents, issues, and profits of the lands vested in them the sum of twelve thousand dollars, and have executed mortgages of such rents, issues, and profits, and the said sum of twelve thousand dollars is now overdue: And whereas the mortgagees have given notice of their intention to exercise the powers vested in them under or by virtue of the said mortgages: And whereas the said Trustees are unable to raise sufficient money to pay off the said sum of twelve thousand dollars on the security of a mortgage granted in pursuance of The Volunteer Drill-sheds and Lands Act 1888: And whereas it is expedient that the said Trustees should have the further powers hereinafter vested in them:
    
    The reference to ""twelve thousand dollars"" was substituted, as from 10 July 1967, for a reference to ""six thousand pounds"" pursuant to section [7(1)][5] of the Decimal Currency Act 1964 (1964 No 27).
