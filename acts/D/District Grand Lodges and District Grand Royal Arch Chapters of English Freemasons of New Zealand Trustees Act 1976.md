An Act to provide for the holding of certain real and personal property by trustees on behalf of the District Grand Lodge of the District of the North Island New Zealand, under the United Grand Lodge of Antient Free and Accepted Masons of England, the District Grand Lodge of the District of the South Island New Zealand, under the said United Grand Lodge, and the Lodges subject to such District Grand Lodges and on behalf of the District Grand Royal Arch Chapter North Island New Zealand, under the Supreme Grand Chapter of Royal Arch Masons of England, the District Grand Royal Arch Chapter South Island New Zealand, under the said Supreme Grand Chapter and the Chapters subject to such District Grand Royal Arch Chapters
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    Whereas the said District Grand Lodges have recently been formed to replace all District Grand Lodges under the said United Grand Lodge heretofore existing in the Dominion of New Zealand: And whereas it is desirable that certain of the real and personal property that belongs now or may hereafter belong to the said District Grand Lodges, or Lodges subject thereto, should vest in and be managed by trustees and that on any change in the trusteeship becoming necessary the title to such property should devolve without the inconvenience and expense of conveyance or transfer being incurred: And whereas under and by virtue of the District Grand Lodge of English Freemasons of Auckland Trustees Act 1935 provision was made for the real and personal property then or thereafter held by the District Grand Lodge of Auckland or by any person or persons on behalf of such District Grand Lodge, or by any Craft Lodge (as therein defined) that, pursuant to section 4 of that Act, resolved to adopt the provisions of the Act, to vest in and be managed by trustees, and thereafter to devolve on a change in trusteeship without incurring the inconvenience and expense of conveyance or transfer: And whereas under and by virtue of the [Masonic Property Trusts Act 1956][18] provision was made inter alia for the real and personal property then and thereafter held by the former District Grand Lodge of Otago and Southland under the said United Grand Lodge or by any person or persons on behalf of such District Lodge, or by any Lodge under the authority of such District Lodge, that pursuant to section 4 of that Act resolved to adopt the provisions of that Act, to vest in and be managed by trustees and thereafter to devolve on a change in trusteeship without incurring the inconvenience and expense of conveyance or transfer: And whereas the said District Grand Royal Arch Chapters North Island and South Island New Zealand, and the Chapters subject to such District Grand Royal Arch Chapters, are desirous of similar provisions being made for them to avoid incurring the inconvenience and expense of conveyance or transfer on a change in trusteeship: And whereas the English Masonic Benevolent Institution (being a Craft Lodge within the meaning of the District Grand Lodge of English Freemasons of Auckland Trustees Act 1935) has now been incorporated under the provisions of the [Charitable Trusts Act 1957][19], and no longer requires to be subject to any private Act of Parliament: And whereas it is desirable that the provisions relating to the vesting and management of certain real and personal property now belonging to or held by or that may hereafter belong to or be held by or on behalf of the said District Grand Lodges, and Lodges subject thereto and the said District Grand Royal Arch Chapters, and Chapters subject thereto should be contained in one Act of Parliament.

*   All Masonic property now held by a Controlling Authority or by any person or persons on behalf of a Controlling Authority, and all Masonic property that may at any time or times hereafter be acquired by a Controlling Authority by gift, purchase, devise, bequest, or otherwise, shall, after the passing of this Act, but subject to and without prejudice to any mortgage, charge, encumbrance, lien, or lease affecting the same respectively, become vested in the trustees, who shall be appointed by such Controlling Authority in accordance with the constitution and laws of a Controlling Authority, upon such trusts and for such purposes and subject to such conditions as shall from time to time be defined by such constitution and laws of a Controlling Authority and shall be subject to the provisions of this Act.

##### 4 Authorising the vesting of Masonic lands and other property of any lodge in trustees
    
*   (1) Upon the passing of a resolution by any Lodge adopting this Act, all Masonic property then held by such Lodge or by any person or persons on behalf of such Lodge, and all Masonic property that may at any time or times thereafter be acquired by such Lodge by gift, purchase, devise, bequest, or otherwise, shall, subject to and without prejudice to any mortgage, charge, encumbrance, lien, or lease affecting the same respectively, become vested in trustees who shall be appointed by such Lodge in accordance with the bylaws for the time being governing such Lodge, upon such trusts and for such purposes and subject to such conditions as shall from time to time be defined by such bylaws and shall be subject to the provisions of this Act.

*   (1) Where any sale, mortgage, transfer, assignment, exchange, lease, surrender, release, or other disposition of any Masonic property subject to the provisions of this Act is made the transfer, mortgage, assignment, exchange, lease, surrender, release, or other disposition of such Masonic property shall be as effectual if signed by any 2 of the trustees for the time being of such Masonic property whose names are entered in the Register of Trustees hereinafter mentioned as if such transfer, mortgage, assignment, exchange, lease, surrender, release, or other disposition had been duly signed by all the trustees or, in the case of any interest in land registered under the [Land Transfer Act 1952][20], by all the registered proprietors thereof.
    
    (2) Any vesting of Masonic property by virtue of [sections 3][5] and [4][6] may be effected upon a Certificate in the form set out in [Schedule 1][16], being endorsed on or enclosed with a dealing as provided in subsection (1).

##### 7 Register of Trustees

##### 8 Provisions as to vesting of lands on appointment of new trustees
    
*   On the entry as aforesaid in the said Register of Trustees of the name or names of any new or additional trustee or trustees of any Masonic property held subject to the provisions of this Act, the interest in such Masonic property that was held by the former trustee to trustees immediately before such entry shall forthwith vest in such new or additional trustee or trustees, solely or jointly as the case may be, together with the former or continuing trustee or trustees (if any) and be subject to the same trusts, without any conveyance or assignment whatsoever; and without derogating from the generality of the foregoing, any entry in the Register of Trustees of the name or names of any new or additional trustee or trustees holding any land or any interest therein subject to the provisions of the [Land Transfer Act 1952][20] shall upon the filing of a certificate in the appropriate District Land Registry in the form set out in [Schedule 1][16] operate so that such new or additional trustee or trustees together with the former or continuing trustees (if any) shall be deemed the proprietor or proprietors thereof within the meaning of the said Land Transfer Act as if the name or names of such new or additional trustee or trustees appeared or was or were entered as such proprietor or proprietors in the Register kept under the provisions of that Act, and as if a certificate of title had been duly issued to him or them, solely, or jointly, as the case may be, with the former continuing proprietor or proprietors (if any) for all the same estate and interest as the former proprietor or proprietors had therein, and subject to the same trusts without any transfer being made for the purpose.

##### 9 Provision for appointment of Deputy Authorised Representative
    
*   The District Grand Master or Grand Superintendent for the time being of any Controlling Authority may at any time and from time to time in addition to appointing the Authorised Representative appoint a Deputy Authorised Representative who shall be designated the Deputy Authorised Representative of the District Grand Lodge of the District of the North (or South) Island New Zealand or of the District Grand Royal Arch Chapter of North (or South) Island New Zealand as the case may be; and such Deputy Authorised Representative during the time for which he shall be so appointed shall have, and may perform and execute all the powers, authorities, and duties of such Authorised Representative, and shall, underneath his signature in the column of the said Register of Trustees, insert the word ""Deputy"", and shall, underneath his signature to any extract to be made by him from such Register of Trustees insert the words ""Deputy Authorised Representative of the District Grand Lodge of the North (or South) Island New Zealand or of the District Grand Royal Arch Chapter of the North (or South) Island New Zealand"", as the case may be.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the District Grand Lodges and District Grand Royal Arch Chapters of English Freemasons of New Zealand Trustees Act 1976\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 26 November 1976, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][24] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][25] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][26] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][27] and [17E][28] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
