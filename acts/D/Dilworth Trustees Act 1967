An Act to facilitate the administration of property and income of the trusts of the will of the late James Dilworth, of Remuera in the Province of Auckland, settler
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    Whereas it is expedient to make better provision for the administration of the trusts and the remuneration of the Trustees and the honorarium of the Visitor of the will of the late James Dilworth, of Remuera in the Province of Auckland, settler, bearing date 15 November 1894 in relation to the Dilworth Ulster Institute as varied by the provisions of the [Dilworth Trustees Act 1902][11], the Dilworth Trustees Act 1902 Amendment Act 1905, the Dilworth Trustees Acts Amendment Act 1912, [section 25][12] of the Reserves and Other Lands Disposal and Public Bodies Empowering Act 1914, [section 21][13] of the Finance Act (No 2) 1940, and the [Dilworth Trust Board Act 1946][14] respectively by conferring wider powers upon the Trustees in the selection of pupils for admission to the said Institute, and by increasing the remuneration of the Trustees and the honorarium of the Visitor, and by providing for the future authorisation and approval of the variation, modification, or extension of the powers of the Trustees or the mode of administration of the trusts by the High Court of New Zealand pursuant to the powers conferred upon it by the [Charitable Trusts Act 1957][15] and any amendment thereof or any Act hereafter passed in substitution therefor and any other powers conferred upon the said court from time to time by any other Act notwithstanding that any such variation, modification, or extension may be at variance or in conflict with any of the provisions of any of the above-mentioned Acts or of [sections 3][5], [4][6], [5][7] and [6][8]:
    
    And whereas the terms and conditions expressly or impliedly imposed upon the Trustees by the said will and the said Acts in the selection of boys as pupils for the said Institute are considered to be unduly restrictive having regard to the changed social conditions presently obtaining in New Zealand:
    
    And whereas it is expedient that those terms and conditions should be varied in order that the Trustees may have wider discretionary powers in respect of the selection of pupils of the said Institute:
    
    And whereas the aggregate remuneration of the Trustees was fixed at 600 pounds per annum under the provisions of the said will:
    
    And whereas the said remuneration is now considered inadequate having regard to the depreciated purchasing power of money and the increased amount of time required to be expended by the Trustees in administering the trusts of the said will and ought to be increased:
    
    And whereas the honorarium of the Visitor was fixed at 50 pounds per annum under the provisions of the said will:
    
    And whereas the said honorarium is now considered inadequate having regard to the depreciated purchasing power of money and ought to be increased:
    
    And whereas having regard to the changing social conditions within New Zealand the Trustees have from time to time considered it necessary or desirable that there be a variation or extension of the powers conferred upon them in relation to the trusts prescribed by the said will and that the mode of administration of those trusts be varied and it has been found necessary to promote legislation to that end:
    
    And whereas it would be more convenient to provide that any variations or extensions of those powers or of the mode of the administration of those trusts which from time to time may be required should be submitted to the High Court of New Zealand for approval in the form of a scheme prepared pursuant to [Part 3][16] of the Charitable Trusts Act 1957 rather than that the Trustees should be required to promote from time to time Acts of Parliament for such purposes as aforesaid:
    
    And whereas the said Charitable Trusts Act 1957 provides adequate safeguards in that it provides for a report from the Attorney-General on any such scheme and that the said court has power to approve with or without modification or reject any such scheme.
    
    Preamble: amended, on 1 April 1980, pursuant to [section 12][17] of the Judicature Amendment Act 1979 (1979 No 124).

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Dilworth Trustees Act 1967\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 April 1980, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][20] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][21] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][22] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][23] and [17E][24] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
