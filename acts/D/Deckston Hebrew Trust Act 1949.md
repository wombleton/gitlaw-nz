An Act to incorporate a board to hold the property now held by the trustees of the Deckston Hebrew Trust and to vary the terms of that trust
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    Whereas by deed poll bearing date 31 March 1936, a copy of which is set out in the [Schedule][28], Annie Deckston, wife of Max Deckston, of the City of Wellington, in New Zealand, settler, declared that she held certain freehold and leasehold properties, more particularly described in the schedule to the said deed, upon trust that the same and the net income from time to time arising therefrom should be appropriated and used in perpetuity for the establishment, maintenance, continuance, and carrying on of a home for Jewish orphan and destitute children in Wellington aforesaid in continuance of the institution for those purposes theretofore carried on by the said Annie Deckston in Rintoul Street, in Wellington aforesaid, and known as the Deckston Hebrew Institute, and for the maintenance, support, housing, upbringing, clothing, benefit, and education of such Jewish orphan children as were then or might thereafter be inmates of the said home, and for the payment of certain expenses in connection with such inmates incurred preliminary to their admittance to or upon their leaving the said home and any other expenses incurred in the execution of the trusts created by the said deed:
    
    And whereas by the said deed the said Annie Deckston declared her intention to appoint a custodian trustee, or trustees of the said freehold and leasehold properties and also to appoint certain persons to be the managing trustees of the trusts therein created:
    
    And whereas the said Annie Deckston died at Wellington aforesaid on 26 September 1938 without having effected any such appointments:
    
    And whereas by orders of the Supreme Court of New Zealand bearing dates 11 March 1940 and 3 December 1940 Philip Myers, of Wellington aforesaid, merchant, Isaac Gotlieb, of Wellington aforesaid, company manager, Charles Weinstein, of Wellington aforesaid, company manager, and David Markham, of Wellington aforesaid, public accountant, were appointed trustees of the trusts created by the said deed, and the said freehold and leasehold properties were vested in them as such trustees:
    
    And whereas the said deed contains no powers to the trustees thereof to sell (except in certain limited circumstances), mortgage or otherwise encumber (except in certain limited circumstances), let, or otherwise deal with the said freehold and leasehold properties, as a result whereof the said trustees have been hindered in the management and use of the said freehold and leasehold properties and in the execution of the trusts of the said deed:
    
    And whereas experience has shown that the number of needy Jewish orphan children in or able to be brought to New Zealand does not justify the continuance at the present time of the said home:
    
    And whereas owing to the limited number of Jewish orphan children in New Zealand now and for some years past requiring the assistance provided for in the said deed the income arising from the said freehold and leasehold properties has not been expended, but has been and is being accumulated:
    
    And whereas for the purposes of making the best practicable use of the said freehold and leasehold properties and the income arising therefrom, in furtherance of the charitable intentions of the said Annie Deckston, it is expedient to extend and vary as hereinafter appears the trusts created by the said deed and to establish a body corporate with perpetual succession and a common seal to administer the trusts as so extended and varied and to confer on such body corporate certain additional powers as hereinafter appears:
    
    And whereas the objects of this Act are not attainable otherwise than by legislation.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Deckston Hebrew Trust Act 1949\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 January 1987, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][31] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][32] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][33] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][34] and [17E][35] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
