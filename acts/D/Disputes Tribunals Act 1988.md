    *   (b) where it dismisses a claim for a declaration under [section 10(1)(b)][17] in respect of a debt or liquidated demand, make an order under [section 19(1)(a)][26] requiring the applicant to pay the debt or liquidated demand, or part of the debt or liquidated demand, to the respondent.
    
    (3) Subject to subsection (4), no claim shall be heard and determined under this Act in respect of the destruction or loss of any property, or any damage or injury to any property, where any offender has been sentenced, under [section 32][136] of the Sentencing Act 2002, to make reparation to the applicant in respect of that destruction, loss, damage, or injury.

    (7) Without limiting [section 10(1A) or (2)][17], nothing in subsection (1) of that section in so far as it confers jurisdiction in quasi-contract on a Tribunal shall be construed as authorising a claim in respect of money due under any enactment.

    (4) Where, in respect of any claim, the applicant has abandoned part of the claim under [section 14][21], and the parties subsequently make an agreement pursuant to subsection (1), then, subject to subsection (2), the claim shall be heard and determined as if that abandonment had not been made.

##### 14 Abandonment to bring claim within jurisdiction
    
*   A person may abandon so much of a claim as exceeds $15,000 in order to bring the claim within the jurisdiction of a Tribunal; and in that event the approval of an agreed settlement under [section 18(3)][25] or, as the case may require, an order of the Tribunal under this Act or any other enactment, in relation to the claim, shall operate to discharge from liability in respect of the amount so abandoned any other person---

    *   (d) the Tribunal may make a work order against any party to the proceedings:

    *   (f) where it appears to the Tribunal that an agreement between the parties has been induced by fraud, misrepresentation, or mistake, or any writing purporting to express the agreement between the parties does not accord with their true agreement, the Tribunal may make an order varying, or setting aside, the agreement or the writing (either wholly or in part):
    
    *   (g) the Tribunal may make an order dismissing the claim.
    
    (1A) The Tribunal may record in an order made under subsection (1)(a) (a _money order_) that the parties have agreed to enforce the payment of the amount specified in that order by way of an attachment order made under the [District Courts Act 1947][145] if---
        
    *   (a) the money order was made at a hearing at which both parties were present; and
    
    *   (b) the party ordered to pay money consented to the payment of the money being enforced by way of an attachment order; and

    (3) Where a Tribunal makes a work order against a party, it shall, where the order is made under [section 18(8)][25] or [section 46(2)][59], at the same time make an order under subsection (1)(a) of this section to be complied with as an alternative to compliance with the work order.
    
    (4) Subject to [section 20][27], a Tribunal shall not make an order under this Act that exceeds any of the monetary restrictions specified in subsection (5), and any order that exceeds any such restriction shall be entirely of no effect.

    (7) Where, in respect of any claim, the jurisdiction of a Tribunal has been extended under an agreement made pursuant to [section 13][20], subsections (5) and (6) shall be read as if every reference in those subsections to $15,000 were a reference to $20,000\.
    
    (8) Nothing in subsection (1) shall restrict the making by a Tribunal of any order that it is authorised to make by any other enactment.
