##### 6 Persons who may bring action
    
*   (1) Every such action shall be brought by and in the name of the executor or administrator of the deceased person:
    
    provided that, where no action is so brought within 6 months after the date of the death of the deceased person, or where within 6 months after the date of the death of the deceased person the executor or administrator declares in writing his desire not to bring the action, or where there is for the time being no executor or administrator of the deceased person, the action may be brought by and in the name of the person, or (if there are more than 1) the names of all or of any of the persons, for whose benefit the action would have been if it had been brought by and in the name of the executor or administrator.
    
    (2) Where any such action is brought by and in the name of any person or persons other than the executor or administrator of the deceased person, the action shall be for the benefit of the same person or persons, and shall be subject to the same procedure, as nearly as may be, as if it were brought by and in the name of the executor or administrator.
    
    Compare: 1908 No 39 ss 5, 10

##### 7 Amount of damages
    
*   (1) In every such action the court may award---
        
    *   (a) such damages as it may think proportioned to the injury resulting from the death to the person or persons for whose benefit the action is brought; and
    
    *   (b) damages in respect of the amount of actual pecuniary benefit which the person or persons for whose benefit the action is brought might reasonably have expected to enjoy if the death had not occurred, whether or not the person or persons have been either wholly or partially dependent upon the deceased person before his death; and
    
    *   (c) damages in respect of the medical and funeral expenses of the deceased person if the expenses have been incurred by the person or any of the persons by whom or for whose benefit the action is brought.

    Compare: 1908 No 39 s 7

*   (1) Except as provided in this section, no action shall be brought under this Act after the expiration of 2 years from the date of the death of the deceased person.
    
    (2) Application may be made to the court, after notice to the intended defendant, for leave to bring such an action at any time within 6 years from the date of the death of the deceased person; and the court may, if it thinks it is just to do so, grant leave accordingly, subject to such conditions (if any) as it thinks it is just to impose, where it considers that the delay in bringing the action was occasioned by mistake or by any other reasonable cause or that the intended defendant was not materially prejudiced in his defence or otherwise by the delay.
    
    (3) Where any person who is under a disability at the date of the death of the deceased person is entitled, under the proviso to subsection (1) of [section 6][8], to bring an action in respect of that death, that action may be brought, without the leave of the court, within 2 years from the date when he ceased to be under a disability or sooner died, or an application for leave to bring that action may be made under subsection (2) within 6 years from the date when he ceased to be under a disability or sooner died, if when the action (without such leave) is commenced or the application is made, as the case may be,---
        
    *   (a) no other person has commenced an action under this Act in respect of the death of the deceased person or made an application for leave to bring such an action; and
    
    *   (b) no grant of administration and no order to or election by Public Trust to administer (other than a grant or order or election made more than 5 years from the date of the death of the deceased person) has been made in New Zealand in respect of the estate of the deceased person.
    
    (4) For the purposes of this section, a person shall be deemed to be under a disability while he is an infant or of unsound mind.

    Compare: 1908 No 39 s 6

##### 13 Damages may be allotted to a dependant or held as class fund
    
*   (1) Where the court makes an order under this Part and is satisfied that there was only 1 dependant of the deceased person, the balance of the damages shall be allotted to that dependant.
    
    (2) Where the court makes an order under this Part and is satisfied that there were 2 or more dependants, the court may order---
        
    *   (a) that the balance of the damages or so much thereof as it may specify shall be allotted to any dependant exclusively, or shall be allotted in such proportions as the court determines among the dependants or among such 2 or more of them to the exclusion of the other or others of them as the court specifies:
    
    *   (b) that the balance of the damages or so much thereof as it may specify shall be held on trust as a class fund for the benefit of the dependants or of such 2 or more of them to the exclusion of the other or others of them as the court specifies.
    
    

##### 14 Disposition of damages allotted to a dependant
    
*   (1) Where any amount is allotted to a dependant under [section 13][16], that amount shall be paid to him unless he is an infant or of unsound mind or except in so far as the court orders that the whole or any part of that amount shall be held on trust under subsection (2).
    
    (2) Where any amount is allotted to any dependant who is an infant or of unsound mind or the court orders that the whole or any part of the amount allotted to a dependant is to be held on trust for that dependant under this subsection, then, except so far as the court directs any immediate payment therefrom, and subject to any directions or conditions given or imposed by the court---
        
    *   (a) the amount shall be invested and held by the trustee upon trust---
            
        *   (i) to make such payments (if any) to the dependant out of the income and capital of the amount as the court may specify; and
        
        *   (ii) to apply the income and capital of the amount or so much thereof as the trustee from time to time thinks fit for or towards the maintenance or education (including past maintenance or education provided after the death of the deceased person) or the advancement or benefit of the dependant:
        
        
    
    *   (b) the dependant shall have no power, either by himself or in conjunction with any other person or persons, to terminate the trusts upon which the amount is held or to modify or extinguish those trusts:
    
    *   (c) the interest of the dependant in the income and capital of the amount shall not, while it remains in the hands of the trustee, be alienated, or pass by bankruptcy, or be liable to be seized, sold, attached, or taken in execution by process of law.
    
    (3) Upon any dependant ceasing to be an infant or of unsound mind while any amount is held on trust for his benefit under subsection (2), the balance of that amount and of the income therefrom remaining in the hands of the trustee shall be paid to the dependant except in so far as the court may have ordered before the payment is made that the whole or any part of that amount shall continue to be held on trust under that subsection:
    
    provided that where the trustee has notice that an application has been made to the court for such an order he shall not make any payment under this subsection until the application has been disposed of.
    
    (4) The court may order that, if any dependant dies while any amount allotted to him is held on trust under subsection (2) (whether or not he is an infant or of unsound mind) any balance of the amount and of the income therefrom remaining in the hands of the trustee at his death, or so much thereof as the court may specify, shall form part of the dependant's estate, or shall be added to the amount allotted to any other dependant or to the amounts allotted to all or any of the other dependants in such proportions as the court may specify or to any class fund set aside out of the balance of the damages, and shall be subject to the trusts of the amount or amounts or fund to which it is added:
    
    provided that if and so far as that balance is not wholly disposed of under any order of the court made during the lifetime of the dependant for whose benefit it had been held, or made on an application to the court made not later than 6 months after that dependant's death, it shall form part of his estate.
    
    Compare: 1939 No 39 [s 14][42]

##### 15 Class fund
    
*   Where any amount is to be held on trust as a class fund for any dependants under subsection (2) of [section 13][16], that amount shall be invested and the trustee may at his discretion, but subject to such directions and conditions as the court may give or impose, apply the income and capital of that amount or so much thereof as the trustee from time to time thinks fit for or towards the maintenance or education (including past maintenance or education provided after the death of the deceased person) or the advancement or benefit of those dependants or of any 1 or more of them to the exclusion of the other or others of them in such shares and proportions and generally in such manner as the trustee from time to time thinks fit; and may so apply the income and capital of that amount notwithstanding that only 1 of those dependants remains alive.

##### 16 Power of court to authorize advances, etc
    
*   (1) The court may from time to time, at its discretion, authorize moneys to be advanced to any dependant (whether by way of loan or otherwise) as it thinks fit, and upon or subject to such conditions as it thinks fit, out of the damages or out of any amounts allotted to other dependants or out of any amount held on trust as a class fund, for any purpose that the court thinks proper in the interests of the dependants or any of them. Without limiting the generality of this subsection, it is hereby declared that any such advance may be made for the purpose of purchasing or otherwise acquiring a residential property for the use of the dependant either alone or in conjunction with any other dependants, or for the purpose of repaying any moneys secured by way of mortgage or otherwise on any residential property owned by the dependant and so used, or for the purpose of furnishing any such residential property. Where moneys are advanced by way of loan, the court may give such directions as it thinks fit in respect of the security to be taken, and may either prescribe the conditions upon or subject to which the moneys are to be advanced or authorize the trustee to prescribe the conditions at his discretion. The conditions may include power to the trustee to remit interest and principal moneys or any part thereof to the extent of the amount or value of any maintenance, education, advancement, or benefit which the dependant to whom the moneys are advanced may provide for any other dependants.
    
    (2) The court may exercise any power under [section 64][43] of the Trustee Act 1956 (which relates to dealings with trust property) either on the creation of any trust under any of the provisions of this Part or from time to time during the continuance of any such trust.

*   In making or varying an order under this Part the court shall have regard to all relevant considerations including, where the damages are recovered in an action which is tried with a jury, any recommendation which the jury may make in respect of the order; and the court may, whenever it considers that it is just and proper to do so, take into consideration all or any of the following matters:
        
    *   (a) any gain to any dependant that is consequent on the death of the deceased person; and
    
    *   (b) circumstances which have arisen after the date of the death of the deceased person; and
    
    *   (c) the probable future needs of the dependants.
    
    

##### 19 Persons who may apply for order or variation of order
    
*   An order or variation of an order under this Part may be made by the court of its own motion or on an application made by---
        
    *   (a) any dependant of the deceased person;
    
    *   (b) the spouse or civil union partner of any such dependant;
    
    *   (c) any near relation by blood or marriage or civil union of any such dependant;

For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][53] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][54] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][55] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][56] and [17E][57] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
