    *   (b) apply pursuant to [section 22][29] for the modification or discharge of the standard condition relating to weapons, in so far as the standard condition relates to him or her:

    Compare: 1982 No 120 s 5

#### Scope of protection orders

##### 14 Power to make protection order
    
*   (1) The court may make a protection order if it is satisfied that---
        
    *   (a) the respondent is using, or has used, domestic violence against the applicant, or a child of the applicant's family, or both; and
    
    *   (b) the making of an order is necessary for the protection of the applicant, or a child of the applicant's family, or both.
    
    (2) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), a respondent who encourages another person to engage in behaviour that, if engaged in by the respondent, would amount to domestic violence against the applicant, or a child of the applicant's family, or both, is regarded as having engaged in that behaviour personally.
    
    (3) Without limiting [section 3(4)(b)][5] or the matters that the court may consider in determining, for the purposes of subsection (1)(b) of this section, whether the making of an order is necessary for the protection of the applicant, or a child of the applicant's family, or both, where some or all of the behaviour in respect of which the application is made appears to be minor or trivial when viewed in isolation, or appears unlikely to recur, the court must nevertheless consider whether the behaviour forms part of a pattern of behaviour in respect of which the applicant, or a child of the applicant's family, or both, need protection.
    
    (4) For the avoidance of doubt, an order may be made under subsection (1) where the need for protection arises from the risk of domestic violence of a different type from the behaviour found to have occurred for the purposes of paragraph (a) of that subsection.
    
    (5) Without limiting the matters that the court may consider when determining whether to make a protection order, the court must have regard to---
        
    *   (a) the perception of the applicant, or a child of the applicant's family, or both, of the nature and seriousness of the behaviour in respect of which the application is made; and
    
    *   (b) the effect of that behaviour on the applicant, or a child of the applicant's family, or both.
    
    

##### 15 Existence of other proceedings not to preclude granting of protection order
    
*   A court must not decline to make a protection order merely because of the existence of other proceedings (including, but not limited to, proceedings relating to the role of providing day-to-day care for, or contact with, or custody of a minor) between or relating to the parties, whether or not those proceedings also relate to any other person.
    
    Section 15: amended, on 1 July 2005, by [section 151][225] of the Care of Children Act 2004 (2004 No 90).

##### 16 Protection of persons other than applicant
    
*   (1) Where the court makes a protection order, that order applies for the benefit of any child of the applicant's family.
    
    (1A) A protection order continues to apply for the benefit of a child of the applicant's family until---
        
    *   (a) the child ceases to be a child of the applicant's family; or
    
    *   (b) the order sooner lapses or is discharged.
    
    (1B) If a child of the applicant's family having attained the age of 17 years continues to ordinarily or periodically reside with the applicant (an **adult child**), a protection order continues to apply for the benefit of the adult child until---
        
    *   (a) the adult child ceases to ordinarily or periodically reside with the applicant; or
    
    *   (b) the order sooner lapses or is discharged.
    
    (2) Subject to subsection (3), where the court makes a protection order, it may direct that the order also apply for the benefit of a particular person with whom the applicant has a domestic relationship.
    
    (3) No direction may be made pursuant to subsection (2) in respect of a person unless the court is satisfied that---
        
    *   (a) the respondent is engaging, or has engaged, in behaviour that, if the respondent and the person were or, as the case may be, had been in a domestic relationship, would amount to domestic violence against the person; and
