##### 14 Power to make protection order
    
*   (1) The court may make a protection order if it is satisfied that---
        
    *   (a) the respondent is using, or has used, domestic violence against the applicant, or a child of the applicant's family, or both; and
    
    *   (b) the making of an order is necessary for the protection of the applicant, or a child of the applicant's family, or both.
    
    (2) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), a respondent who encourages another person to engage in behaviour that, if engaged in by the respondent, would amount to domestic violence against the applicant, or a child of the applicant's family, or both, is regarded as having engaged in that behaviour personally.
    
    (3) Without limiting [section 3(4)(b)][5] or the matters that the court may consider in determining, for the purposes of subsection (1)(b) of this section, whether the making of an order is necessary for the protection of the applicant, or a child of the applicant's family, or both, where some or all of the behaviour in respect of which the application is made appears to be minor or trivial when viewed in isolation, or appears unlikely to recur, the court must nevertheless consider whether the behaviour forms part of a pattern of behaviour in respect of which the applicant, or a child of the applicant's family, or both, need protection.
    
    (4) For the avoidance of doubt, an order may be made under subsection (1) where the need for protection arises from the risk of domestic violence of a different type from the behaviour found to have occurred for the purposes of paragraph (a) of that subsection.
    
    (5) Without limiting the matters that the court may consider when determining whether to make a protection order, the court must have regard to---
        
    *   (a) the perception of the applicant, or a child of the applicant's family, or both, of the nature and seriousness of the behaviour in respect of which the application is made; and
    
    *   (b) the effect of that behaviour on the applicant, or a child of the applicant's family, or both.
    
    

##### 15 Existence of other proceedings not to preclude granting of protection order
    
*   A court must not decline to make a protection order merely because of the existence of other proceedings (including, but not limited to, proceedings relating to the role of providing day-to-day care for, or contact with, or custody of a minor) between or relating to the parties, whether or not those proceedings also relate to any other person.

*   (1) Where the court makes a protection order, that order applies for the benefit of any child of the applicant's family.
    
    (1A) A protection order continues to apply for the benefit of a child of the applicant's family until---
        
    *   (a) the child ceases to be a child of the applicant's family; or
    
    *   (b) the order sooner lapses or is discharged.
    
    (1B) If a child of the applicant's family having attained the age of 17 years continues to ordinarily or periodically reside with the applicant (an **adult child**), a protection order continues to apply for the benefit of the adult child until---
        
    *   (a) the adult child ceases to ordinarily or periodically reside with the applicant; or
    
    *   (b) the order sooner lapses or is discharged.
    
    (2) Subject to subsection (3), where the court makes a protection order, it may direct that the order also apply for the benefit of a particular person with whom the applicant has a domestic relationship.
    
    (3) No direction may be made pursuant to subsection (2) in respect of a person unless the court is satisfied that---
        
    *   (a) the respondent is engaging, or has engaged, in behaviour that, if the respondent and the person were or, as the case may be, had been in a domestic relationship, would amount to domestic violence against the person; and
    
    *   (b) the respondent's behaviour towards the person is due, in whole or in part, to the applicant's domestic relationship with the person; and
    
    *   (c) the making of a direction under this section is necessary for the protection of the person; and
    
    *   (d) where practicable, the person consents to the direction being made.
    
    (4) Subsections (2) to (5) of [section 14][19] apply, with the necessary modifications, in respect of an application for a direction pursuant to subsection (2) of this section.
    
    (5) If the applicant dies at any time after a protection order is made for the protection of the applicant, then, notwithstanding the death of the applicant, the order (if it has not sooner lapsed or been discharged) continues to apply for the benefit of---
        
    *   (a) a child who at the time of the applicant's death was a child of the applicant's family, until that child attains the age of 17 years; and
    
    *   (b) a person in respect of whom a direction has been made under subsection (2), until the order lapses or is discharged.
    
    (6) Subsections (1A), (1B), and (5) apply in respect of a protection order regardless of whether the protection order is made before or after the commencement of those subsections.

*   (1) Subject to subsection (2), where the court makes a protection order against the respondent, the court may also direct that the order apply against a person whom the respondent is encouraging, or has encouraged, to engage in behaviour against a protected person, where that behaviour, if engaged in by the respondent, would amount to domestic violence.
    
    (2) No direction may be made under subsection (1) in respect of a person unless the court is satisfied that---

##### 76 Respondent to notify intention to appear
