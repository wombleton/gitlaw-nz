    *   (a) in relation to an agreement for the sale, letting, hiring, or bailment of goods, premises at which the vendor normally carries on a business or at which goods of the description to which the agreement relates, or goods of a similar description, are normally offered or exposed for sale in the course of a business carried on at those premises:
    
    *   (b) in relation to an agreement for the provision of services (whether alone or together with goods), premises (not being premises belonging to or occupied by the purchaser) at which the vendor or any bank, solicitor, or chartered accountant normally carries on business

    *   (a) any agreement under which the purchaser is a body corporate; or
    
    *   (b) any agreement under which the purchaser is a person engaged in buying and selling goods of the same or a similar nature or description as the goods that are the subject of the agreement; or
    
    *   (c) any agreement under which the purchaser is a person who is carrying on any farming, agricultural, or manufacturing business, or any other business of any kind whatsoever or who is practising any profession if the goods that are the subject of the agreement are goods of a type that are normally used in the carrying on of the business or in the practice of the profession; or

    *   (e) where the purchaser has supplied other goods in part exchange for the goods that are the subject of the agreement or any collateral agreement the vendor shall forthwith redeliver the goods so supplied to the purchaser.
    
    (2) Unless before the end of the period of 10 days beginning with the date of the giving of the notice under [section 7][9], the goods supplied by the purchaser in part exchange for the goods that are the subject of the agreement are redelivered to the purchaser, the purchaser shall be entitled to receive from the vendor an amount equal to the value of the goods at the time at which they were supplied by the purchaser or to the sum (if any) which was agreed to be allowed by the vendor in respect of the goods whichever is the greater.
    
    (3) The vendor shall be liable to pay compensation to the purchaser for any damage done to the goods supplied by the purchaser in part exchange, while these goods have been in the custody of the vendor, other than damage arising from the normal use of the goods or damage arising from circumstances beyond the vendor's control.
    
    (4) During the period of 10 days referred to in subsection (2) the purchaser, if he is in possession of the goods that are the subject of the agreement, shall be entitled to retain possession of them until either---
        
    *   (a) the goods agreed to be taken in part exchange are redelivered to him; or
    
    *   (b) a sum equal to their value or the part exchange value, as the case may require, has been paid to him; or
    
    *   (c) compensation in terms of subsection (3) has been paid to him;
    
    and if, immediately before the end of that period, he continues by virtue of this subsection to be entitled to retain possession of the goods to which the agreement relates, he shall have a lien on those goods for any sum which he is entitled to recover by virtue of subsection (2) or subsection (3).
    
    (5) Any sum payable under any of the provisions of subsections (1) to (3) shall be recoverable as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction. In any action for the recovery of any such sum the purchaser shall, if successful, be entitled to recover from the vendor his full costs, fees, and other reasonable expenses, including reasonable costs incurred between solicitor and client.
    
    (6) If the vendor has provided any services under the agreement before it is cancelled, he shall not be entitled to any compensation for those services.

    (2) The purchaser shall not be under any obligation to deliver any such goods except at his own premises and in pursuance of a request (whether oral or in writing) from the vendor, and any such obligation shall be subject to any lien or other right to retain the goods which he may have under subsection (1) or subsection (4) of [section 9][11].
    
    (3) Subject to the following provisions of this section, the purchaser shall be under an obligation to take reasonable care of any such goods, if they have come into his possession in consequence, or in anticipation, of the making of the agreement, until the end of the period of 21 days beginning with the date of the giving of the notice of cancellation.
    
    (4) The purchaser may send any such goods at his own expense to the vendor and, if the purchaser does so, he shall be under an obligation to take reasonable care to see that they are received by the vendor and are not damaged in transit to him, but in other respects his obligation to take care of the goods shall cease on his sending the goods to the vendor.
    
    (5) Where at any time during the period of 21 days the purchaser receives such a request as is mentioned in subsection (2), and unreasonably refuses or fails to comply with it, his obligation to take reasonable care of the goods shall continue until he has complied with the request.
    
    (6) The purchaser shall take reasonable care to see that the goods are received by the vendor or a person for the time being entitled to the possession of the goods.

    (8) The purchaser shall also be liable to pay compensation to the vendor for any damage done to the goods or for the loss or destruction thereof while the goods have been in the custody of the purchaser, other than damage arising from the normal use of the goods or loss or damage arising from circumstances beyond his control:
    
    provided that no compensation shall be payable under this subsection in respect of any damage done to the goods or of their loss or destruction if it occurs more than 21 days after the day on which the notice of cancellation was given unless the purchaser is still under an obligation to take reasonable care of them pursuant to subsection (5).
    
    (9) The liability of the purchaser to pay compensation under subsection (8) also applies in respect of any loss occasioned by any breach of his duty under subsection (6) or by the performance by him of any act in relation to the goods (other than an act involved in the normal use of them) which is inconsistent with ownership of them by the vendor.
    
    (10) Except as provided for in subsections (3) to (9) the purchaser shall not be under any obligation to take care of the goods by reason of their having come into his possession.

The court shall not be precluded from inquiring into and determining those questions by any provision in the agreement or in any other document unless the court considers that in all the circumstances of the case, including the subject matter and value of the transaction and the respective bargaining strengths of the parties, it is fair and reasonable that the provision should be conclusive between the parties.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Door to Door Sales Act 1967\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 July 2013, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][34] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][35] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][36] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][37] and [17E][38] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
