An Act to extend the powers of the Whanganui College Board of Trustees, and to vary the trusts upon which the properties of that Board are held
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    Whereas by Crown grant dated 13 October 1852, after reciting that a school was about to be established in Wanganui under the superintendence of the Right Reverend George Augustus, Lord Bishop of New Zealand, for the education of children of Her Majesty's subjects of all races, and of children of other poor and destitute persons being the inhabitants of islands in the Pacific Ocean, certain land in the district of Wanganui containing 250 acres and 32 perches, more or less (which land is more particularly described in [Schedule 1][7]), was granted unto the said George Augustus, Lord Bishop of New Zealand, and his successors to hold unto the said George Augustus, Lord Bishop of New Zealand, and his successors in trust nevertheless and for the use and towards the maintenance and support of the said school so long as religious education, industrial training, and instruction in the English language should be given to the youth educated therein or maintained thereat:
    
    And whereas approximately 39 acres of the said land were taken by the Crown by Proclamation in the year 1947:
    
    And whereas the balance of the said piece or parcel of land described in [Schedule 1][7] is now vested (subject to the trusts declared by the said Crown grant) in a Board of Trustees incorporated under the Religious, Charitable, and Educational Trusts Boards Incorporation Act 1884 under the name of the Whanganui College Board of Trustees (hereinafter referred to as the **Board of Trustees**):
    
    And whereas the Board of Trustees has maintained, and is maintaining, 2 schools at Wanganui pursuant to and in terms of the said trusts:
    
    And whereas, pursuant to the Church of England Trusts Act 1913, the members of the Board of Trustees are appointed by the Wellington Diocesan Trusts Board, and the Board of Trustees is responsible to make periodical reports to the Synod of the Diocese of Wellington and to the General Synod:
    
    And whereas, with the object of best furthering the education contemplated in the said Crown grant, it is expedient that the industrial training referred to in the said Crown grant should be given by the Education Department at technical colleges fully equipped with the plant and apparatus necessary for modern industrial training and that the Board of Trustees, in consideration of the concession to the Crown hereinafter mentioned, should be released forever from their responsibility to give industrial training at the said schools and that the trusts declared by the said Crown grant should be varied accordingly:
    
    And whereas the Education Department already provides and will continue to provide industrial training at Wanganui:
    
    And whereas it is desirable further to clarify and define the trusts of the said Crown grant:
    
    And whereas the Board of Trustees has leased to the Wanganui Education Board under leases for terms of up to 60 years certain portions of the said land which are more particularly described in [Schedule 2][8], and which leases are for the terms set forth in [Schedule 2][8] and do not provide for any compensation to the lessee for improvements:
    
    And whereas the Wanganui Education Board holds on renewable lease from the Board of Trustees certain other portions of the said land which are more particularly described in [Schedule 3][9]:
    
    And whereas the Wanganui Education Board has effected improvements of considerable value upon the land contained in all the aforesaid leases.

    (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1), the Board of Trustees shall set aside in each year out of the net income derived by it from such part of the land described in [Schedule 1][7] as shall from time to time be held by the Board of Trustees the sum of 400 pounds.

    provided that if in any year the full sum of 400 pounds shall not be expended in the scholarships or concessions heretofore referred to in this subsection, then the unexpended balance of the said moneys shall be available for the purposes referred to in subsection (1).

*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][15] and [17E][16] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.

        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)

    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
