*   #### Preamble
    
    WHEREAS by Crown grant dated the fourteenth day of February, one thousand eight hundred and sixty, all that parcel of land described in the Schedule hereto was granted to the Right Reverend Father in God, George Augustus, Bishop of New Zealand, upon trust that the same should be consecrated as a site for a church and burial-ground according to the rites of the United Church of England and Ireland; and the Bishop of New Zealand, in pursuance of the powers vested in him in that behalf by the Bishop of New Zealand Trusts Act 1858, did convey the land so granted to him to trustees appointed by the General Synod of the religious body then known as ""The Branch of the United Church of England and Ireland in New Zealand"", but now known as ""The Church of the Province of New Zealand, commonly called **The Church of England**"": And whereas the successors in title as trustees of the said lands are now incorporated under the provisions of the Religious, Charitable, and Educational Trust Boards Incorporation Act 1884, and named **The Wellington Diocesan Board of Trustees**: And whereas the trusts of the said land as regards a burying-ground have long since ceased to be capable of being carried out, by reason of a Provincial Ordinance forbidding the burying of the dead in the said land as from the seventh day of March, one thousand eight hundred and fifty-five, and the area of the said land is larger than is required only for the site of a church, and the General Synod is desirous that the said Board should have powers whereby the land might be more effectually utilized for the benefit of the Church in the Borough of Wanganui and the district surrounding the same:

BE IT THEREFORE ENACTED by the General Assembly of New Zealand in Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:---
