*   #### Preamble
    
    (1) The Whakarewarewa Valley Land and the Roto-a-Tamaheke Reserve are of significant cultural, traditional, historical, and spiritual importance to Ngāti Whakaue and Tūhourangi Ngāti Wahiao:
    
    (2) The Whakarewarewa Valley Land comprises the Whakarewarewa Thermal Springs Reserve and the Southern Arikikapakapa Reserve:
    
    (3) The fee simple estate in the Whakarewarewa Valley Land and the Roto-a-Tamaheke Reserve is vested as follows:
        
    *   (a) the fee simple estate in the Southern Arikikapakapa Reserve is vested in the Crown:
    
    *   (b) the fee simple estate in the Whakarewarewa Thermal Springs Reserve was vested in the Crown but, under the [Affiliate Te Arawa Act][52], is being vested in the Te Pūmautanga trustees:
    
    *   (c) the fee simple estate in the Roto-a-Tamaheke Reserve was vested in the Crown but, under the Affiliate Te Arawa Act, is being vested in the Te Pūmautanga trustees:
    
    (4) The Whakarewarewa Valley Land is subject to certain leases that are being granted to MACI in connection with the vesting of the fee simple estate in the Whakarewarewa Thermal Springs Reserve under the [Affiliate Te Arawa Act][52]:
    
    (5) The Whakarewarewa Thermal Springs Reserve and the Roto-a-Tamaheke Reserve are recreation reserves under the [Reserves Act 1977][53], administered under the [Tourist and Health Resorts Control Act 1908][54]. Under the [Affiliate Te Arawa Act][52], the Te Pūmautanga trustees will become the administering body of those Reserves, and the Reserves will be renamed the Whakarewarewa Thermal Springs Recreation Reserve and the Roto-a-Tamaheke Recreation Reserve respectively:
    
    (6) Some of the land included in the Southern Arikikapakapa Reserve forms part of a recreation reserve under the [Reserves Act 1977][53] known as the Arikikapakapa Reserve. The Arikikapakapa Reserve is administered under the [Tourist and Health Resorts Control Act 1908][54]. The Arikikapakapa section 8 land is also a recreation reserve under the Reserves Act 1977 administered under the Tourist and Health Resorts Control Act 1908:
    
    (7) On 8 April 2008, in order to assist its objective of building healthy relationships with Ngāti Whakaue and Tūhourangi Ngāti Wahiao, the Crown agreed (in principle) to transfer the fee simple estate in the Southern Arikikapakapa Reserve to Ngāti Whakaue and Tūhourangi Ngāti Wahiao, subject to certain conditions. The transfer was not to be consideration or redress of any nature for the settlement of any claim against the Crown that was, or was founded on, a right arising from the [Treaty of Waitangi][55], the principles of the Treaty, or otherwise:
    
    (8) The Te Pūmautanga trustees agreed to transfer the fee simple estate in the Whakarewarewa Thermal Springs Reserve and the Roto-a-Tamaheke Reserve to Ngāti Whakaue and Tūhourangi Ngāti Wahiao:
    
    (9) Ngāti Whakaue and Tūhourangi Ngāti Wahiao agreed to establish a joint trust to hold the fee simple estate in the Whakarewarewa Valley Land and the Roto-a-Tamaheke Reserve:
    
    (10) The deed establishing the joint trust includes a procedure for determining the beneficial entitlement to the fee simple estate in the Whakarewarewa Valley Land and the Roto-a-Tamaheke Reserve and for the possible transfer of some or all of those lands following the determination. Under the vesting deed dated 5 August 2008 (_see_ recital (12)), the Crown acknowledged that Tūhourangi, Ngāti Wahiao (including Ngāti Tukiterangi, Ngāti Huarere and Ngāti Hinganoa) and Ngāti Hurungaterangi, Ngāti Taeotu me Ngāti Te Kahu o Ngāti Whakaue and the Koromatua hapū of Ngāti Whakaue, including the collective of the beneficial owners of Pukeroa Oruawhata block, all have the right to have their claims to the beneficial ownership of the Whakarewarewa Valley Land and the Roto-a-Tamaheke Reserve independently determined through that procedure:
    
    (11) Legislation is required to enable the Whakarewarewa Valley Land and the Roto-a-Tamaheke Reserve to be vested in the trustees of the joint trust and the Crown's conditions in relation to the vesting to be met:
    
    (12) A deed to introduce the vesting legislation, dated 5 August 2008, was signed by the Minister in Charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations, the Minister of Māori Affairs, the Minister of Tourism, representatives of Ngāti Whakaue and Tūhourangi Ngāti Wahiao, and the Te Pūmautanga trustees (on behalf of the Affiliate Te Arawa Iwi/Hapū):

The Parliament of New Zealand therefore enacts as follows:

    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][95] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][96] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][98] and [17E][99] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly

    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
