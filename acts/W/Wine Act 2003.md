    *   (a) the Director-General would be justified under [section 24][29] in suspending operations under the plan but, in light of repeated suspensions of operations under the wine standards management plan in the past under that section, it would be more appropriate to deregister the plan; or
    
    *   (b) there is or has been such a serious failure of operations or other matters under the plan as to cast doubt on the fitness for its intended purpose of the wine produced under the plan; or

*   (1) The Director-General may at any time remove any wine business from the coverage of a registered wine standards management plan that applies to 2 or more comparable businesses if the Director-General is satisfied that deregistration of the plan would be appropriate under [section 25(1)][30] if the business were the only one operating under the plan.
    
    (2) Subsections (2) to (7) of [section 25][30] apply in relation to the removal of the business from the coverage of the wine standards management plan as if references in those subsections to deregistration of the plan were references to removal from the coverage of the plan.

    *   (b) are fit for the intended purpose of the wine no matter what the status or description of the consumer, or what has happened to the consignment since it left New Zealand; or
    
    *   (c) are fit for a purpose other than that for which they were intended.

*   (1) An official assurance may be withdrawn by the Director-General or other authorised person if the Director-General or person is satisfied that---
        
    *   (a) the assurance was incorrectly or inappropriately given; or

### Subpart 2---Cost recovery

##### 84 Principles of cost recovery
    
*   (1) The Minister and the Director-General must take all reasonable steps to ensure that so many of the direct and indirect costs of administering this Act as are not provided for by money appropriated by Parliament for the purpose are recovered under this subpart, whether by way of fees, levies, or otherwise.
    
    (2) In determining the most appropriate method of cost recovery under [section 85][137], and its level, in any particular case or class of cases of wine, business, person, or other matter, the Minister and Director-General must have regard, as far as is reasonably practicable, to the following criteria:
        
    *   (a) equity, in that funding for a particular function, power, or service, or a particular class of functions, powers, or services, should generally, and to the extent practicable, be sourced from the users or beneficiaries of the relevant function, power, or service at a level commensurate with their use or benefit from the function, power, or service:
    
    *   (b) efficiency, in that costs should generally be allocated and recovered in order to ensure that maximum benefits are delivered at minimum cost:
    
    *   (c) justifiability, in that costs should be collected only to meet the reasonable costs (including indirect costs) for the provision or exercise of the relevant function, power, or service:
    
    *   (d) transparency, in that costs should be identified and allocated as closely as practicable in relation to tangible service provision for the recovery period in which the service is provided.
    
    (3) Costs should not be recovered under this subpart unless there has been appropriate consultation with affected parties and relevant industry organisations in accordance with [section 115][173], and the parties involved have been given sufficient time and information to make an informed contribution.
    
    (4) Nothing in subsection (3) or in [section 87][139] or [section 115][173] requires consultation in relation to specific fees or charges, or the specific levels of fees or charges, so long as the fees or charges set are reasonably within the purview of any general consultation or any consultation carried out for the purposes of section 115, and a failure to comply with subsection (3) does not affect the validity of any regulations made for the purposes of this subpart.
    
    (5) Nothing in this section requires a strict apportionment of the costs to be recovered for a particular function or service based on usage; and, without limiting the way in which fees or charges may be set, a fee or charge may be set at a level or in a way that---
        
    *   (a) is determined by calculations that involve an averaging of costs or potential costs:
    
    *   (b) takes into account costs or potential costs of services that are not directly to be provided to the person who pays the fee or charge but which are an indirect or potential cost arising from the delivery of the service in question to a class of persons or all persons who use the service.
    
    

##### 85 Methods of cost recovery
    
*   The methods by which costs may be recovered under this subpart are as follows:
        
    *   (a) fixed fees or charges:
    
    *   (b) fees or charges based on a scale or formula or at a rate determined on an hourly or other unit basis:
    
    *   (c) use of a formula or other method of calculation for fixing fees and charges:
    
    *   (d) the recovery by way of fee or charge of actual and reasonable costs expended in, or associated with, the performance of a service or function:
    
    *   (e) estimated fees or charges, or fees or charges based on estimated costs, paid before the provision of the service or function, followed by reconciliation and an appropriate further payment or refund after provision of the service or function:
    
    *   (f) refundable or non-refundable deposits paid before provision of the service or performance of the function:
    
    *   (g) fees or charges imposed on users of services or third parties:
    
    *   (h) levies:
    
    *   (i) any combination of the above.
    
    

##### 86 Cost recovery to relate generally to financial year
    
*   (1) Except as provided in subsection (2), any regulations under this subpart that set a fee, charge, or levy that applies in any financial year---
        
    *   (a) must have been made before the start of that financial year; but
    
    *   (b) except as the regulations may otherwise provide, apply in that year and all subsequent years until revoked or replaced.
    
    (2) Subsection (1) does not prevent the alteration or setting during any financial year of a fee, charge, or levy payable in that year if either---
        
    *   (a) the fee, charge, or levy is reduced, removed, or restated without substantive alteration; or
    
    *   (b) in the case of an increase or a new fee, charge, or levy,---
            
        *   (i) appropriate consultation in accordance with [section 115][173] has been carried out with persons or representatives of persons substantially affected by the alteration or setting; and
        
        *   (ii) the Minister is satisfied that those persons, or their representatives, agree or do not substantially disagree with the alteration or setting.
        
        
    
    (3) Subsection (1) does not prevent the amendment of any regulation setting a fee, charge, or levy if any substantive alteration effected by the amendment is for the purpose of correcting an error.
    
    (4) Recovery may be made in any financial year of any shortfall in cost recovery for any of the preceding 4 financial years, and allowance may be made for any over-recovery of costs in those years (including any estimated shortfall or over-recovery for the immediately preceding financial year).

##### 87 Three-yearly review of cost recovery
    
*   (1) The Minister must cause to be reviewed, at least once in every 3-year period occurring since the original setting of, or latest change to, the levels and methods of cost recovery in relation to any class of wine, business, person, or other matter, the levels and methods of cost recovery in the relevant area that are likely to be appropriate for the following financial year or years.
    
    (2) The Minister must ensure that appropriate consultation in accordance with [section 115][173] takes place in relation to any such review.
    
    (3) A review may make provision for recovery in any relevant financial year of any shortfall in cost recovery for any of the preceding 4 financial years, or make allowance for any over-recovery of costs in those years (including any estimated shortfall or over-recovery for the immediately preceding financial year).
    
    (4) Subsection (1) does not require all areas of cost recovery to be reviewed at the same time, nor does it impose any time limit on the making of regulations to implement the results of a review.

##### 88 Fees and charges to be prescribed by regulations
    
*   (1) Regulations may be made under this Act, on the recommendation of the Minister, prescribing fees and charges for the purposes of this Act.

    (3) Different fees and charges, or different rates or types of fee or charge, may be prescribed in respect of different classes or descriptions of wine, persons or businesses, operations, or other matters, or any combination of them.

    *   (c) differ for otherwise similar services provided in different ways:
    
    *   (d) differ for otherwise similar services provided to different categories of person:
    
    *   (e) differ depending on the amount of service required or the components of the service required for the particular person or class of person.
    
    (5) Where regulations prescribe a formula for determining a fee or charge, the formula may specify the value of 1 or more of its components as being an amount or amounts notified for these components by the Director-General under [section 120][179].
    
    (6) The Minister may not recommend the making of regulations under this section unless satisfied that, to the extent appropriate in the circumstances, the requirements of [sections 84][136] and [86][138] have been met.

##### 89 Regulations may impose levies
    
*   (1) Regulations may be made under this Act, on the recommendation of the Minister, prescribing levies for the purposes of this Act.

    *   (a) specify when and how any levy is to be paid:
    
    *   (b) require that any levy, or estimated amount of levy, be paid in advance of performance of the services or functions to which it relates:
    
    *   (c) specify persons, other than persons primarily responsible for paying the levy, who are to be responsible for collecting a levy, and provide for retention of any part of the levy money collected as a fee for that service:
    
    *   (d) require, or empower the Director-General to require, the provision of information and returns in relation to levies:
    
    *   (e) require the keeping of separate trust accounts for levy money received or deducted by persons responsible for collecting levies, and prescribe matters in relation to those trust accounts:

    *   (a) any amount held in such an account that is due to be paid to the Director-General by the levy collector is to be treated as levy money held on trust for the Director-General; and
    
    *   (b) any amount so held on trust is not available for the payment of any creditor (other than the Director-General) of the levy collector, and is not liable to be attached or taken in execution at the instance of any such creditor; and
    
    *   (c) a person who ceases to be a person responsible for collecting a levy must continue to maintain the trust account until all the levy money payable to the Director-General in respect of the period during which the person was responsible for collecting the levy has been paid.
