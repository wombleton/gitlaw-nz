*   #### Preamble
    
    WHEREAS it is expedient to consolidate and amend the laws relating to the Wellington College and the High School for Girls established in the City of Wellington:

BE IT THEREFORE ENACTED by the General Assembly of New Zealand in Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:---

##### 1 Short Title
    
*   The Short Title of this Act is The Wellington College and Girls' High School Act 1887\.

##### 2 Constitution of governing body of Wellington College and Girls' High School
    
*   The governing body of the Wellington College and Girls' High School shall consist of eight members to be called **the Governors**, one of whom shall be the Mayor for the time being of the City of Wellington, another shall be the Chairman for the time being of the Education Board of the District of Wellington, and of the remaining six members divided into two equal groups three shall be elected by the parents or guardians of pupils attending the school who have attended the school for not less than one quarter, and three others shall be appointed by the Governor in Council. And every person so appointed, excepting the Mayor of the City of Wellington for the time being, and the Chairman for the time being of the Education Board, shall, subject to the provisions hereinafter contained, continue in office for the term of five years from his appointment.
    
    Provided that the Mayor of Wellington may at any time by notice in writing to the Town Clerk retire from membership of the governing body, and the Wellington City Council may at any time thereafter by resolution appoint one of their number to be a Governor, to hold office until the expiry of the then current term of office of the Mayor.
    
    Provided also that the Chairman for the time being of the Education Board of the District of Wellington may at any time, by notice in writing to the Secretary of that Education Board, retire from membership of the governing Body, and that Education Board may at any time thereafter by resolution appoint one of their number to be a Governor, to hold office until the expiry of the then current term of office of the Chairman of that Education Board.
    
    Section 2 was amended, as from 10 March 1933, by section 12 Education Amendment Act 1932-33 (1932-33 No 49), by inserting the first proviso. The repeal of section 12 Education Amendment Act 1932-33 by section [142(3)][24] Education Act 1989 does not affect that proviso.
    
    Section 2 was amended, as from 1 December 1951, by section 2 Wellington College and Girls' High School Amendment Act 1951 (1951 No 34), by inserting the second proviso.

##### 3 Election of Governors
    
*   The first election of Governors by parents or guardians as aforesaid shall be held in such manner as the Governor in Council shall direct, and subsequent elections by parents or guardians as aforesaid shall be conducted by the Governors in such manner as they shall think fit.

*   The said Governors for the time being shall be a body corporate by the name of **The Governors of the Wellington College and Girls' High School**, and shall have a common seal, with power to break, alter, and renew the same. The said body corporate is hereinafter referred to as **the Governors**.

##### 5 Governors to vacate office in certain cases
    
*   If any of the Governors, excepting the Mayor or Chairman of the Education Board aforesaid, shall die, or by writing under his hand addressed to the Governors resign, or hold or be directly or indirectly interested in any office of profit or contract with the Governors of the Wellington College, or cease by lapse of time to be a Governor, or cease for six calendar months to reside in the Provincial District of Wellington, or fail to attend any meeting of the Governors for three consecutive months without having obtained leave of absence from the Governors, or become bankrupt, or make any arrangement or composition with his creditors under the provisions of any law for the time being in force relating to bankruptcy or insolvency, or be convicted of any treason, felony, or indictable misdemeanour, he shall immediately cease to be a Governor, and the vacancy so occasioned shall be filled by the appointment of a new member in the manner in which the vacating member was appointed, but the number of Governors for the time being in office shall never exceed eight:
    
    Provided that if any such Governor shall be resident out of the Provincial District of Wellington with the permission in writing of the Governors, then any period for which such permission is expressed to be granted shall not be included in the computation of the said period of six calendar months, and fresh permissions may be granted from time to time.
    
    Section 5 was amended, as from 1 December 1951, by section 3 Wellington College and Girl's High School Amendment Act 1951 (1951 No 34), by substituting the words ""filled by the appointment of a new member in the manner in which the vacating member was appointed"" for the words ""filled up by the parents or guardians as aforesaid, or by the Governor in Council, as the case may require"".

##### 6 First meeting and election of Chairman
    
*   The Governors shall meet for the first time at such time and place as the Governor in Council shall appoint, and shall forthwith proceed to elect a Chairman, who shall preside at all meetings of the Governors at which he is present held during the year next after his election, and until some other Governor shall be elected Chairman in his place, and when so presiding shall have a deliberative and casting vote, and until other provision shall be made by the Governors he shall have the custody of the common seal; and if at any meeting of the said Governors the Chairman shall not be present, the Governors then present shall appoint one of their number as Chairman for that meeting, and the Governor so appointed shall, during the meeting for which he is so appointed, have all the powers of the Chairman. Until such first meeting the Governors now acting shall continue in office with such powers and authorities as they possessed prior to the passing of this Act.

##### 7 Governors may regulate meetings, &c
    
*   The Governors shall make, and may from time to time vary, add to, suspend, revoke, and make afresh, regulations for the conduct of business at their meetings, for determining how meetings shall be convened and what number shall be a quorum thereat, for the custody of their common seal, for the appointment of committees, and for other like purposes.

##### 8 Minutes of proceedings to be kept

##### 13 Power to let lands
    
*   The Governors shall have power with respect to all lands which may be vested in them upon trust for the purposes of this Act to manage the same as they may deem fit, and, except as hereinafter provided from time to time, to let the same or any part thereof for any term not exceeding forty-two years from the date of the lease thereof at such rent and on such terms and conditions as they shall think fit, but so that no fine, premium, or foregift be taken.

*   The Governors shall have power with respect to the lands described in Schedule [1][22] hereto, being portions of the College Site Reserve not required as a playground or for other college purposes, to manage the same as they may think fit, and from time to time to let the same, or any parts thereof, for any term not exceeding forty-two years in possession from the date of the lease thereof, at such rent and on such conditions as they shall think fit, but so that no fine, foregift, or premium be taken:
    
    Provided always that only such of the said lands shall be so leased as are described on a certain plan deposited by the Governors in the office of the Colonial Secretary, showing the allotments into which the lands intended to be let were subdivided, and the streets to be dedicated to public use:

    Provided that the Governors shall have power, if they think fit, to set apart out of the said rents, profits, and annual income, such part as they shall think fit, either as an addition to the capital fund which shall then be invested and dealt with as part of such capital, or as a reserve fund to meet extraordinary expenses, which shall be invested and dealt with in such manner as the Governors shall direct.

##### 16 Governors to have control of College and Girls' High School
    
*   The whole control and management of the Wellington College and Girls' High School shall be vested in the Governors, who shall have power to appoint, and from time to time to remove, all teachers, examiners, and other officers and servants.
