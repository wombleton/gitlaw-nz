    Whereas it is expedient to consolidate and amend the laws relating to the Wellington College and the High School for Girls established in the City of Wellington:

##### 1 Short Title
    
*   The Short Title of this Act is the Wellington College and Girls' High School Act 1887\.

##### 2 Constitution of governing body of Wellington College and Girls' High School
    
*   The governing body of the Wellington College and Girls' High School shall consist of eight members to be called **the Governors**, one of whom shall be the Mayor for the time being of the City of Wellington, another shall be the Chairman for the time being of the Education Board of the District of Wellington, and of the remaining 6 members divided into 2 equal groups 3 shall be elected by the parents or guardians of pupils attending the school who have attended the school for not less than one quarter, and 3 others shall be appointed by the Governor in Council. And every person so appointed, excepting the Mayor of the City of Wellington for the time being, and the Chairman for the time being of the Education Board, shall, subject to the provisions hereinafter contained, continue in office for the term of 5 years from his appointment.
    
    Provided that the Mayor of Wellington may at any time by notice in writing to the Town Clerk retire from membership of the governing body, and the Wellington City Council may at any time thereafter by resolution appoint one of their number to be a Governor, to hold office until the expiry of the then current term of office of the Mayor.
    
    Provided also that the Chairman for the time being of the Education Board of the District of Wellington may at any time, by notice in writing to the Secretary of that Education Board, retire from membership of the governing Body, and that Education Board may at any time thereafter by resolution appoint one of their number to be a Governor, to hold office until the expiry of the then current term of office of the Chairman of that Education Board.
    
    Section 2 was amended, as from 10 March 1933, by section 12 Education Amendment Act 1932-33 (1932-33 No 49), by inserting the first proviso. The repeal of section 12 Education Amendment Act 1932-33 by [section 142(3)][25] Education Act 1989 does not affect that proviso.
