##### 7 Authority to carry out reclamation

    provided that where any part of the lands described in item 3 of [Schedule 2][17] are reclaimed under the authority given under this subsection and are taken pursuant to section 148 of the Act for motorway purposes the compensation entitled to be received by the Board shall not exceed the amount which the Board has actually laid out upon the said land either for the costs of reclamation or otherwise in permanently improving the same.
    
    (2) Whereas by a grant (hereinafter called the _Te Aro grant_) from the Crown dated 24 June 1874 a piece of land described in the [Schedule][20] of the Te Aro Reclamation Act 1879 was granted to the Mayor, Councillors, and Citizens of the City of Wellington (hereinafter called the _Corporation_) upon certain trusts for reclamation:
    
    And whereas the said land was in the harbour of Wellington and below high-water mark:
    
    And whereas by the [Te Aro Reclamation Act 1879][21] power to fill up and reclaim the whole of the land in the Te Aro grant from the sea was conferred on the Corporation:
    
    And whereas the [Reclamation Within the Harbour of Wellington Act 1887][22] recited that reclamation as far as the seaward boundary line of the land comprised in the Te Aro grant would be injurious to the harbour of Wellington and it was necessary to define the limits beyond which future reclamation by the Corporation should not extend and further to provide for certain reclamation to the limits so defined:
    
    And whereas the [Reclamation Within the Harbour of Wellington Act 1887][22] defined a line as set forth in [Schedule 1][23] of the said Act (hereinafter called the _defined line_) and provided that it should not be lawful for the Corporation to reclaim from the sea any part of the harbour of Wellington beyond (that is to say on the seaward side of) the limit of the defined line:
    
    And whereas the [Reclamation Within the Harbour of Wellington Act 1887][22] by [section 10][24] thereof provided that the Board should have certain rights, privileges, and powers in respect of the said land lying between the defined line and the seaward limit of the Te Aro grant and the water covering the same other than the power of reclamation:
    
    And whereas by the [Wellington Harbour Board and Corporation Empowering Act 1898][25] and a deed dated 13 June 1898 between the Board and the Corporation (which deed was validated by such Act and is hereinafter called the _deed_) the Board was given power to carry out certain reclamation work over part of the said land lying between the defined line and the seaward limit of the Te Aro grant but by [section 8][26] of the Wellington Harbour Board and Corporation Empowering Act 1898 the land specified in the fifteenth schedule to the deed (which land forms part of the Te Aro grant) was excluded from the power to reclaim and the Board covenanted in clause 7 of the deed that it would not reclaim from the sea any of the land described in the fifteenth schedule to the deed:
    
    And whereas, pursuant to the deed, the land described in the fifteenth schedule was vested in the Board and now constitutes the land described in item 1(b) of [Schedule 2][17]:
    
    And whereas to improve the facilities of the Port of Wellington and to suit the convenience of ships it is desired to reclaim the land described in items 1(a) and (b) of [Schedule 2][17] (including the land described in the fifteenth schedule to the deed):
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
        
    *   (a) the Board is hereby authorised and empowered, notwithstanding anything contained in section 175 of the Act, but subject to sections 176 to 182 of the Act, to reclaim lands in the harbour of Wellington, namely, the land described in items 1(a) and (b) of [Schedule 2][17]:
    
    *   (b) the land described in item 1(b) of [Schedule 2][17] shall cease to be subject to any restrictions imposed by the [Reclamation Within the Harbour of Wellington Act 1887][22], the [Wellington Harbour Board and Corporation Empowering Act 1898][25], and the deed dated 13 June 1898 between the Board and the Corporation:
    
    *   (c) the District Land Registrar for the Land Registration District of Wellington is hereby authorised and directed to remove any such restrictions from any certificates of title or other document relating to the land described in item 1(b) of [Schedule 2][17].
    
    

##### 8 Authority to borrow
    
*   (1) It shall be lawful for the Board from time to time, as it may require, to borrow, subject to the provisions of the Harbours Act 1950 and the Local Authorities Loans Act 1956 a sum or sums of money not exceeding in the aggregate the sum of $6,200,000\.
    
    (2) The money hereby authorised to be borrowed is in addition to any money heretofore authorised to be borrowed by the Board under any other Act.

    And whereas it is no longer desirable to proceed with the construction of the Thorndon Wharf and the Lambton Wharf as specified in the 1952 Act:
    
    And whereas the Board desires to apply the said sum of $5,000,000 towards the harbour work specified in item 3 of [Schedule 3][18]:

    And whereas the Board has borrowed pursuant to the 1961 Act and for the said work at King's Wharf and has not expended at the present time the sum of $551,272:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    The Board is hereby empowered, in addition to the expenditure hereinbefore authorised by this Act and its [Schedule 3][18], to apply and expend in and towards the harbour work specified in item 3 of the said Schedule 3, being part of the Thorndon Wharf development and the harbour work specified in item 1 of the said Schedule 3, being part of the Taranaki Street Wharf development, in such proportions as the Board may determine, the sum of $551,272 or such amount as may not be otherwise expended under the said authority contained in the 1961 Act and to provide that sum from the said moneys borrowed under the authority of the 1961 Act.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Wellington Harbour Board Loan and Empowering Act 1967\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 October 1988, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][33] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][34] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][35] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][36] and [17E][37] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
