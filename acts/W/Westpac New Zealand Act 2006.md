    (3) For the avoidance of doubt, **tax book value** in subsection (2) includes any interest accrued immediately before the appointed day but, other than where an amount has been written off in accordance with [section DB 31][46] of the Income Tax Act 2007, does not include any adjustment for---
        
    *   (a) a decline in the other party's creditworthiness between the date on which the financial arrangement was entered into and the appointed day; or
    
    *   (b) an increase in the possibility that the other party will not meet an obligation under the financial arrangement between the date on which the financial arrangement was entered into and the appointed day.

    *   (c) for any income year the last day of which falls on or after the appointed day, [section EA 3][47] of that Act applies---
            
        *   (i) to Westpac New Zealand as if Westpac New Zealand had been allowed a deduction under that Act for the amount of expenditure to which paragraph (a) applies; and

    (3) For the purposes of the [Income Tax Act 2007][39], if Westpac New Zealand derives an amount on or after the appointed day in respect of a designated asset or designated liability, that amount is income of Westpac New Zealand if it would have been income of Westpac Banking Corporation if the designated asset or designated liability had not vested in Westpac New Zealand and Westpac Banking Corporation had derived the amount.
    
    (4) For the purposes of [sections CG 3][50] and [DB 31][46] of the Income Tax Act 2007, on and from the appointed day Westpac Banking Corporation and Westpac New Zealand must be treated as the same person in respect of any obligation that is owed to Westpac Banking Corporation immediately before the appointed day and that vests in Westpac New Zealand.
    
    (5) The amount of tax payable by Westpac New Zealand under the [Goods and Services Tax Act 1985][51] in respect of, or in relation to, any of the designated assets and liabilities must be determined as if Westpac New Zealand and Westpac Banking Corporation were the same person.
    
    (6) The vesting of the designated assets and liabilities in Westpac New Zealand---
        
    *   (a) is to be treated as not being a supply for the purposes of the [Goods and Services Tax Act 1985][51]; and
    
    *   (b) does not give rise to a dutiable gift for the purposes of the [Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968][52]; and

    (9) For the purposes of the [Income Tax Act 2007][39], whether or not any designated asset or designated liability is revenue account property of Westpac New Zealand is to be determined as if Westpac Banking Corporation and Westpac New Zealand were the same person.
    
    (10) For the purposes of the [Income Tax Act 2007][39] and the [Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971][57], any transaction that has been registered as a registered security by Westpac Banking Corporation, and any class of transactions that has been registered as registered securities by Westpac Banking Corporation, is to be treated as having also been registered as a registered security or registered securities by Westpac New Zealand; and Westpac New Zealand is deemed to be an approved issuer in respect of those registered securities.
    
    (11) Westpac Banking Corporation and Westpac New Zealand are deemed to be the same person for the purposes of the making, giving, or receiving of any elections, notices, certificates, and filings required or provided for under the Inland Revenue Acts, except any returns that are required to be filed after the appointed day by either Westpac Banking Corporation or Westpac New Zealand with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue under the [Tax Administration Act 1994][58] or the [Goods and Services Tax Act 1985][51].

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Westpac New Zealand Act 2006\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 18 June 2011, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][66] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][67] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][68] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][69] and [17E][70] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
