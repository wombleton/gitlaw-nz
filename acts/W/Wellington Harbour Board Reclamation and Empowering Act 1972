    (2) The adequacy of such provisions shall be agreed upon by the Board, the Petone Borough Council, the Lower Hutt City Council, and the Hutt River Board before the reclamation is commenced, or, failing agreement, shall be determined by the Town and Country Planning Appeal Board, on the application of any of the aforesaid local authorities, as if such application were an appeal against the decision of a Council under section 351BE of the Municipal Corporations Act 1954\.

##### 9 Board not authorised to create a nuisance
    
*   Nothing in [section 5][6] or [section 6][7] shall entitle the Board to create a nuisance or shall deprive any person of any right or remedy he would otherwise have against the Board or any other person in respect of any such nuisance, and no restriction or condition imposed by the Minister of Marine pursuant to section 178 of the Act or requisition or direction issued in accordance with paragraph (a) of [section 7][8], whether or not the Board has complied with the same, shall restrict the liability of the Board for any such nuisance.

##### 10 Rights reserved

    And whereas section 187 of the Harbours Act 1950 vests in the Board land reclaimed under the authority of such special orders:
    
    And whereas the said land constitutes part of the Thorndon Wharf Development:
    
    And whereas the Board desires to lease or has leased part of the land pursuant to the powers contained in section 144 of the Harbours Act 1950: 
    
    And whereas the land described in the said [Schedule 3][16] has been defined as a wharf pursuant to the powers contained in section 190 of the Harbours Act 1950:
    
    And whereas doubts have been expressed as to the powers of the Board to lease, pursuant to section 144 of the Harbours Act 1950, the said land: 
    
    And whereas it is desirable that the said doubts should be removed and that the Board should have power to so lease the whole or part of the said land:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    Notwithstanding the provisions of the Harbours Act 1950 and the fact that the land described in [Schedule 3][16] is defined as a wharf pursuant to the powers contained in section 190 of the Harbours Act 1950, the Board is hereby authorised and empowered and shall be deemed always to have been authorised and empowered to lease, pursuant to the powers contained in section 144 of the Harbours Act 1950, the whole or any part of the said land.

    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][20] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][21] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][22] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][23] and [17E][24] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
