#### Presumptions to operate in favour of claimants for pensions

##### 17 Presumption that disablement or death attributable to service
    
*   (1) Where any claim for a pension under this Act is made by or in respect of a member of the forces who, on attesting for service or at any time thereafter, was medically graded as fit for service with the forces, the medical grading shall, except as otherwise provided in this section, be accepted as conclusive proof of the absolute physical and mental fitness of the member at the time of that grading, subject only to any physical or mental conditions qualifying that absolute fitness that may be specifically recorded in the medical record made at the time of the medical grading:
    
    provided that the foregoing provisions of this subsection shall not apply if the medical grading of the member has been altered by a competent authority within 2 months after he has been actually attached to the forces for service therein but before he has been subjected to any conditions that have in fact prejudicially affected his physical or mental fitness or to any conditions that may be regarded as having possibly or probably so affected his physical or mental fitness, and the member has been officially informed of the alteration of his grading within 3 months after he has been so attached to the forces for service therein.
    
    (2) The foregoing presumption in favour of the claimant based on the medical grading of the member shall not operate in any case where it is proved that the member failed to reveal to the medical examiners, after proper inquiry made of him, any material facts in relation to his physical or mental health or history, or where it is proved that by reason of any false statement, non-disclosure, or misrepresentation he was erroneously graded.
    
    (3) In any case in which the foregoing presumption in favour of the claimant does not for any reason apply or is not sufficient to establish his claim, the claimant shall be entitled to produce to the Secretary or an Appeal Board, as the case may be, any evidence (whether strictly legal evidence or not) to show that the condition that resulted in the disablement or death of the member was possibly or probably attributable to or aggravated by his service with the forces in connection with any war or emergency, and if any reasonable evidence to that effect is produced there shall thereby be established a presumption that that condition was in fact attributable to or aggravated by the service of the member, and that presumption may be rebutted only by evidence that satisfies the Secretary or Appeal Board that the condition was not so attributable or aggravated but was due entirely to other causes.
    
    (4) Where any member of the forces has suffered the loss of, or the permanent loss of the use of, one of any paired organs of the body, and that loss is held to be attributable to his service, the subsequent loss or impairment of the efficiency of the other corresponding organ (from whatever cause arising) shall be conclusively presumed to be attributable to his service.

    (2) In the application of the general rule formulated in subsection (1) the following particular rules shall apply---
        
    *   (a) in no case shall there be on the claimant any onus of proving that the disablement or death on which the claim is based was in fact attributable to the service of the member or that the condition that resulted in the disablement or death of the member was aggravated by his service:
    
    *   (b) the claimant shall be given the full benefit of the presumptions in his favour provided for in [section 17][41]:
    
    *   (c) the Secretary or an Appeal Board, as the case may be, shall be entitled to draw and shall draw from all the circumstances of the case, from evidence furnished, and from medical opinions submitted to the Secretary or Appeal Board, all reasonable inferences in favour of the claimant, and the claimant shall, in every case, be given the benefit of any doubt as to the existence of any fact, matter, cause, or circumstance that would be favourable to him.

*   (1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, pensions in respect of the disablement or death of any member of the forces (whether occurring before or after the commencement of this Act) shall be payable under this Part to the member and his dependants (in the case of his disablement) or to the dependants of the member (in the case of his death) in any of the following cases, namely:
        
    *   (a) in any case where the disablement or death of the member occurred while he was on service overseas as a member of the forces in connection with any war in which Her Majesty was then engaged, or in connection with any emergency, whether arising out of the obligations undertaken by New Zealand in the Charter of the United Nations or otherwise:
    
    *   (b) in any case where the disablement or death of the member is attributable to his service in New Zealand or overseas:
    
    *   (c) in any case where the condition that resulted in the disablement or death of the member was aggravated by his service in New Zealand or overseas:
    
    provided that, except with the approval of the Minister, no pension shall be payable under this Part in respect of the disablement or death of any member if, at the date of his disablement or death, he was a deserter from the forces or was absent without leave and was not in receipt of continuous pay as a member of the forces:
    
    provided also that where any claim for a pension is made by a member in respect of his disablement the Secretary or an Appeal Board, as the case may be, may decline to grant a pension or may grant a pension at a reduced rate in any case where the Secretary or Appeal Board is satisfied on reasonable evidence that the disablement of the member is attributable in whole or in part to his wilful misconduct during his period of service.
    
    (2) In any case to which paragraph (a) of subsection (1) applies, the disablement or death of the member, as the case may be, shall for the purposes of this Act be deemed to be attributable to his service as a member of the forces.
    
    (3) Nothing in this section shall apply to a spouse or partner of a member of the forces who is in receipt of a disablement pension payable under this Part in respect of any period of service which commenced on or after 3 September 1939, unless the member or the spouse or partner of the member, as the case may be, is entitled to make an election under [section 66L][143] to receive a war service pension and has not made such an election.
    
    (4) Notwithstanding anything in subsection (3), if any person is, on 1 April 1971, in receipt of a pension payable under subsection (1) as the wife of a disabled person, and is not entitled to make an election under [section 66L][143], the pension may, so long as the person remains otherwise qualified, continue to be paid to that person.
    
    (5) If the disablement or death of a member of the Armed Forces of New Zealand within the meaning of the Accident Compensation Act 1982 occurred while he was serving (whether in New Zealand or elsewhere) as such a member in connection with a war or emergency, or is attributable to such service, or if the condition that resulted in the disablement or death of such a member was aggravated by such service, the disablement or death of the member, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be attributable to service as a member of the forces within the meaning of this Act, and the provisions of this Act shall apply accordingly.

    (2A) The adjustments (by any percentage movements upwards in the CPI) required under subsection (2) as at 1 April in any year from 2011 to 2017 (inclusive) must, despite subsections (1) and (2), be calculated,---

    *   (a) a couple who are married or in a civil union or in a de facto relationship and who are both qualified to receive a veteran's pension is not less than 65% or more than 72.5% of the average ordinary time weekly earnings (males and females combined) as determined by the last Quarterly Employment Survey of wages published by Statistics New Zealand before 1 March in each year (after the deduction of standard tax and the earner levy payable on those earnings):
    
    *   (b) a single person who is living alone is 65% of the weekly amount of the veteran's pension (before any abatement under [section 74D][161] but after the deduction of standard tax) payable to a couple who are married or in a civil union or in a de facto relationship and who are both qualified to receive a veteran's pension:

    (4) Every Order in Council made under subsection (2) must adjust the annual rates of the veterans' pensions so that the rate of the veteran's pension specified in clause 2(b) of [Schedule 11][230] preserves its proportional relationship (before any abatement under [section 74D][161] or before any calculation is made under Income Test 3, as the case may be, but after the deduction of standard tax) to the rates specified in clause 1 of that schedule.
    
    (5) An adjustment under this section must not reduce the weekly amounts payable under this section.
