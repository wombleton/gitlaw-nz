*   #### Preamble
    
    WHEREAS the pieces or parcels of land described in [Schedule 1][38] hereto were granted by the Crown to the persons named, and have been held upon the trusts and for the purposes expressed in the said [Schedule 1][38]: And whereas the said trusts have been administered by the trustees thereof under the general supervision of the authorities from time to time (now the Conference) of what is now called or known as the Methodist Church of New Zealand: And whereas it is considered that the general efficiency of administration of the trusts will be increased, and the endowments of the trusts turned to better account, if such provisions are made concerning the premises as are hereinafter set forth:

BE IT THEREFORE ENACTED by the General Assembly of New Zealand in Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:---

##### 1 Short Title
    
*   This Act may be cited as the Wellington Methodist Charitable and Educational Trusts Act 1916\.

##### 2 Interpretation
    
*   In the construction of this Act, unless the context shall otherwise require,---
    
    _The Conference_ means the Conference of the Methodist Church of New Zealand
    
    _The Board_ means the Board constituted by this Act.

##### 3 Incorporation of trustees
    
*   (1) The present trustees of the said lands (now incorporated under the [Charitable Trusts Act 1957][40], under the name of ""The Wellington Methodist Educational Trust Board""), and all new members appointed to the Board, whether by way of succession or addition, shall be and are hereby constituted a body corporate under the name of ""The Board of the Wellington Methodist Charitable and Educational Endowments,"" having a perpetual succession and a common seal, and capable in law for the purposes of the trusts to be administered by them and of this Act of doing and suffering all such things as corporate bodies may do and suffer, and with power to take and hold lands subject to the provisions of this Act.
    
    (2) The present trustees hereby constituted members of the Board are the persons following---that is to say, William James Harland, accountant; John Kershaw, foreman gasfitter; William Clement Hemery, accountant; Robert Hosie, watchmaker; George Tiller, settler; Ernest William Abraham Kellow, accountant; William Wallace Moxham, factory-manager; William Edwin Redstone, insurance agent; James Kellow, accountant; James Gates Chapman, Methodist minister: all of Wellington.

##### 4 Appointment of Chairman
    
*   The Conference may annually appoint some person (whether a member of the Board or not) as Chairman of the Board, who, if not already a member, shall be _ex officio_ a member of the Board.

No person shall be eligible to become or act as a member of the Board who is not an adherent of the Methodist Church of New Zealand.

##### 8 President of Conference to make declaration of new members appointed
