    (2) Without limiting the definition of the term _public place_ or _specified place_ in subsection (1), for the purposes of this Act, a person is in a _specified place_ if he or she is in or on a vehicle that is in a _specified place_.

##### 5 Power to make bylaws designating specified places or gangs
    
*   (1) The Council may, from time to time, make bylaws---
        
    *   (a) designating any public place as a specified place for the purposes of this Act:
    
    *   (b) identifying an organisation, association, or group of persons as a gang for the purposes of this Act.
    
    (2) In making a bylaw under subsection (1), the Council must use the special consultative procedure set out in [section 83][15] of the Local Government Act 2002\.
    
    (3) [Section 86(2)(a)][16] and (b) of the Local Government Act 2002 apply to the making of a bylaw under subsection (1) as if it were an activity described in [section 86(1)][16] of that Act.
    
    (4) The Council must not make a bylaw identifying a gang under subsection (1)(b) unless it is satisfied that the organisation, association, or group proposed to be identified has the following characteristics:
        
    *   (a) a common name or common identifying signs, symbols, or representations; and
    
    *   (b) its members, associates, or supporters individually or collectively promote, encourage, or engage in a pattern of criminal activity.
    
    (5) The Council may make a bylaw under this section only if it is satisfied that the bylaw is reasonably necessary in order to prevent or reduce the likelihood of intimidation or harassment of members of the public in a specified place or to avoid or reduce the potential for confrontation by or between gangs.
    
    (6) A bylaw must not be made under subsection (1)(a) if the effect of the bylaw, either by itself or in conjunction with other bylaws made under subsection (1)(a), would be that all the public places in the district are specified places.

##### 6 Signposting of specified places
    
*   (1) The Council must, where reasonably practicable, indicate the location of a specified place designated by a bylaw made under [section 5][4] by 1 or more clearly legible notices affixed in 1 or more conspicuous places on, or adjacent to, the place to which the notice relates.
    
    (2) No prosecution under [section 12][11], and no arrest or seizure under [section 13][12], may be challenged on the ground that a notice was not affixed in accordance with subsection (1).

##### 7 Public notice of bylaws and availability of copies
    
*   [Section 157][17] of the Local Government Act 2002 applies to a bylaw made under [section 5][4] as if the bylaw had been made under that Act.

##### 8 Review of bylaws
    
*   The Council must review a bylaw made by it under [section 5][4] no later than 5 years after the date on which the bylaw was made.

##### 9 Further reviews of bylaws every 10 years
    
*   The Council must review a bylaw made by it under [section 5][4] no later than 10 years after it was last reviewed as required by [section 8][7] or this section.

##### 10 Procedure for and nature of review
    
*   (1) The Council must review a bylaw to which [section 8][7] or [9][8] applies by making the determinations required by [section 5(4)][4] and (5).
    
    (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), [section 5(4)][4] and (5) apply with all necessary modifications.
    
    (3) If, after the review, the Council considers that the bylaw---
        
    *   (a) should be amended, revoked, or revoked and replaced, it must act in accordance with [section 5(2)][4] and (3):
    
    *   (b) should continue without amendment, it must use the special consultative procedure in [section 83][15] of the Local Government Act 2002, and [section 5(3)][4] does not apply.
    
    (4) For the purposes of subsection (3)(b), the statement of proposal referred to in [section 83(1)(a)][15] of the Local Government Act 2002 must include---

##### 11 Bylaw not reviewed within specified time frame revoked

##### 12 Prohibition of display of gang insignia
    
*   (1) No person may display gang insignia at any time in a specified place in the district.
    
    (2) Every person who, without reasonable excuse, contravenes subsection (1) commits an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding $2,000\.
    
    (3) Without limitation, and to avoid doubt, a Judge may apply [section 128][18] of the Evidence Act 2006 in deciding whether a sign, symbol, or representation is gang insignia for the purposes of this Act.

##### 13 Powers of arrest and seizure in relation to persons displaying gang insignia
    
*   (1) A constable may, without warrant,---
        
    *   (a) arrest a person who the constable has good cause to suspect has committed an offence against [section 12(2)][11]:
    
    *   (b) seize and remove gang insignia (by the use of force if necessary) that has been or is being displayed in a specified place.
    
    (2) Gang insignia seized under subsection (1)(b) is forfeited to the Crown if the person from whom the gang insignia is taken pleads guilty to, or is convicted of, an offence against [section 12(2)][11].
    
    (3) If gang insignia is forfeited to the Crown under subsection (2), the gang insignia may be destroyed or otherwise disposed of as the court, either at the time of the conviction for the offence under [section 12(2)][11] or on a subsequent application, directs.

##### 14 Power to stop vehicle to exercise powers of arrest or seizure
    
*   (1) A constable may stop a vehicle without a warrant to exercise either or both of the powers in [section 13(1)][12] in relation to a person if the constable has reasonable grounds to believe that the person is in or on the vehicle.
    
    (2) A constable who stops a vehicle under subsection (1) must---
        
    *   (a) be wearing a uniform or distinctive cap, hat, or helmet with a badge of authority affixed to that cap, hat, or helmet; or
    
    *   (b) be following immediately behind the vehicle in a motor vehicle displaying flashing blue lights, or flashing blue and red lights, and sounding a siren.
    
    (3) A constable exercising the stopping power conferred by subsection (1) must, immediately after the vehicle has stopped,---
        
    *   (a) identify himself or herself to the driver of the vehicle; and
    
    *   (b) tell the driver that the stopping power is being exercised under this section for the purpose of exercising powers under [section 13(1)][12]; and
    
    *   (c) if not in uniform and if so required, produce evidence that he or she is a constable.

    *   (d) require the vehicle to remain stopped for as long as is reasonably necessary to exercise the powers---
            
        *   (i) in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c); and
        
        *   (ii) in [section 13(1)][12], in relation to a person referred to in subsection (1) of this section.
