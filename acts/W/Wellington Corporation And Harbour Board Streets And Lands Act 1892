BE IT ENACTED by the General Assembly of New Zealand in Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:---

##### 1 Short Title
    
*   The Short Title of this Act is The Wellington Corporation and Harbour Board Streets and Lands Act 1892\.

##### 2 Interpretation
    
*   In this Act, if not inconsistent with the context,---
    
    _The Corporation_ means the Mayor, Councillors, and Citizens of the City of Wellington, incorporated under The Municipal Corporations Act 1886
    
    _The Board_ means the Wellington Harbour Board, constituted by The Wellington Harbour Board Act 1879\.

##### 3 Custom-house Quay widened
    
*   It shall be lawful for the Governor to grant to the Corporation, as and for a public street, the land defined in Schedule [1][13] to this Act, being land not required for the purposes of the railway extension to Te Aro, and lying between Custom-house Quay and the said railway extension. The Corporation shall first pay into the Public Account of the Colony the sum of one thousand nine hundred and ninety-two dollars, being the cost of the reclamation of the said land from the sea, and of other works connected therewith. It shall be lawful for the Corporation to plant with trees or shrubs any portion of the said land, and to fence in the area so planted, and to erect any public conveniences thereon.
    
    The expression ""one thousand nine hundred and ninety-two dollars"" was substituted, as from 10 July 1967, for the expression ""nine hundred and ninety-six pounds"" pursuant to section [7(1)][22] Decimal Currency Act 1964 (1964 No 27).

##### 4 Boat Harbour reclamation
    
*   It shall be lawful for the Governor to grant to the Board the land defined in Schedule [2][14] to this Act, being land not required for the purposes of the railway extension to Te Aro, and lying to seawards of the railway extension. The Board shall pay into the Public Account of the Colony the sum of one thousand seven hundred and eighty dollars, being the cost of reclamation of the said land from the sea, and of other works in connection therewith. The said land shall be vested in the Board as an endowment.
    
    The expression ""one thousand seven hundred and eighty dollars"" was substituted, as from 10 July 1967, for the expression ""eight hundred and ninety pounds"" pursuant to section [7(1)][22] Decimal Currency Act 1964 (1964 No 27).

##### 5 Land under wharf
    
*   \[Repealed\]
    
    Section 5 was repealed, as from 25 September 1987, by section [19][23] Wellington Harbour Board and Wellington City Council Vesting and Empowering Act 1987 (1987 No 5(L)).

##### 6 Harbour Board's reserve
    
*   The lands described in Schedule [4][16] to this Act, being part of a public street, shall be henceforth vested in the Board as a reserve, and shall not be let by the Board, nor shall any buildings be erected thereon.

##### 7 Harbour Board's endowment
    
*   The land described in Schedule [5][17] to this Act, being land now forming part of a public street, is hereby vested in the Board as an endowment, with power to the Board to let the same without previous public auction or tender to the tenant of the lands adjacent thereto, for such term not exceeding the residue of the term for which such adjacent lands are held, and upon such conditions, as to the Board shall seem fit.

##### 8 Queen's Wharf approach
    
*   The Governor may, by Order in Council, declare that the land described in Schedule [6][18] to this Act, being land now vested in the Board as an approach to the wharf, shall be divested from the Board and vested in the Corporation as a public street; and upon the gazetting of such Order in Council the said land shall be so divested from the Board and vested in the Corporation accordingly. No such Order in Council shall be made except upon the joint application of the Corporation and the Board. The Board may pay to the Corporation such sum as may be agreed upon between the two bodies as the capitalised value of the future cost to the Corporation of the maintenance of the said piece of land as a public street.

##### 9 Mount Victoria Signal-station
    
*   The piece of land described in Schedule [7][19], being land at and near the signal-station at Mount Victoria, is hereby vested in the Board in trust for the purposes of a signal-station.

##### 10 Shed **J,** Waterloo Quay
    
*   Whereas a shed heretofore erected by the Board has been built in such a manner as to encroach upon the street known as Waterloo Quay, which street is vested in the Board by The [Wellington Harbour Board and Corporation Land Act 1880][24]: And whereas it is desirable to authorise such encroachment: Be it therefore enacted that such encroachment by the erection of part of a shed upon that part of Waterloo Quay defined in Schedule [8][20] to this Act shall be deemed to have been made under the authority of this Act, and the public right of way over that part of Waterloo Quay so defined shall be extinguished until such time as the Governor may order the removal of the said shed.

##### 11 Weighbridge site
    
*   Whereas, by section [3][25] of The [Wellington Queen's Wharf and Store Sales Act 1881][26], the Corporation was empowered to grant to the Board a lease for a term not exceeding forty-two years at a peppercorn rental of the parcel of land upon which the weighbridge and the office connected therewith have been erected, such parcel of land forming part of Custom-house Quay and of the approach to the Queen's Wharf: And whereas it has been found desirable to remove the said weighbridge and office to a part of Jervois Quay: Be it therefore enacted that the Corporation is hereby empowered to grant to the Board a lease for a term of thirty-one years, at an annual rental of twenty dollars, of the piece of land described in Schedule [9][21] to this Act, notwithstanding that such land forms part of a public street; and the Corporation is hereby further empowered at the expiration of such term to grant to the Board a renewal of such lease for such term of years, at such rent, and subject to such conditions as shall be agreed upon between the Corporation and the Board, and again in the same manner from time to time to renew such lease. The weighbridge and office shall be deemed to be tenants' fixtures removable by the Board at the expiration of any such lease. After the removal of the weighbridge and office from their present position the present site thereof shall become part of the public street.
    
    The expression ""twenty dollars"" was substituted, as from 10 July 1967, for the expression ""ten pounds"" pursuant to section [7(1)][22] Decimal Currency Act 1964 (1964 No 27).

##### 12 Width and position of Jervois Quay altered
    
*   Whereas by section [9][27] of The [Reclamation within the Harbour of Wellington Act 1887][28], it was enacted that a street should be laid out and constructed by the Corporation, of the width, on the lines, and in the manner shown on the plan of the Marine Department numbered one thousand three hundred and forty-three: And whereas an alteration has been made by the Minister for Public Works in the proposed line of railway shown on the said plan: Be it therefore enacted that the said section [9][27] shall henceforth be read as if the words ""as qualified by the plan of the Marine Department numbered one thousand seven hundred and forty-two"" had been added after the words ""plan of the Marine Department numbered one thousand three hundred and forty-three,"" wherever the same occur in the same section; and that any land comprised in the said plan numbered one thousand three hundred and forty-three heretofore laid out or dedicated by the Corporation as a public highway or street, and which by the joint operation of The [Reclamation within the Harbour of Wellington Act 1887][28], and this Act, is not required to be laid out as a street, shall cease to be such highway or street, and shall henceforth be held by the Corporation in like manner as if such laying out or dedication had not taken place.
