BE IT THEREFORE ENACTED by the General Assembly of New Zealand in Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:---

*   The area described in the Schedule hereto (hereinafter referred to as the said area) shall henceforth be within the jurisdiction of the Wellington Corporation and the Wellington Council for the purposes of drainage, waterworks, and water-supply in as full a manner as if such area were within the city; and the Wellington Council may hereafter, in respect of the said area, exercise all or any of the powers and duties vested in or imposed on them respectively in relation to drainage, waterworks, and water-supply by the said Act as if the said area were part of the city.

##### 4 Application of by-laws of the city
    
*   (1) The said area and every person therein, and every person owning or occupying land therein, shall be subject to all by-laws for the time being in the City of Wellington relating to waterworks and water-supply, to drainage and drains (whether public or private), to the prevention or suppression of nuisances, and to the care and preservation of public health, whether such by-laws are made under the said Act or any other public Act enabling the Wellington Corporation or Wellington Council in that behalf.
    
    (2) The Wellington Council, in manner provided and subject to the provisions of the said Act, may make, alter, and repeal such by-laws as it shall think fit relating to waterworks and water-supply, to drainage and drains (whether public or private), to the prevention or suppression of nuisances, and to the care and preservation of public health and for general sanitary purposes, with special regard to the said area, and for preventing any stream or watercourse in the said area from being polluted or infected by sewage or any deleterious or offensive matter.
