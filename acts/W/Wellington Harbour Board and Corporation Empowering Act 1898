An Act to enable the Wellington Harbour Board and the Corporation of the City of Wellington to exchange certain Lands, and to confer certain Powers upon the Board and the Corporation respectively.
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    WHEREAS the land described in the [First][20] Schedule to the agreement hereinafter referred to is vested in the Board: And whereas, by grant from the Crown dated the twenty-fourth day of June, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-four, the land described therein was vested in the Corporation upon trust for reclamation and for purposes of public utility: And whereas by an Act of the General Assembly of New Zealand intituled The [Reclamation within the Harbour of Wellington Act 1887][21], the Corporation was prohibited from reclaiming from the sea any part of the land comprised in the said grant lying to the seaward side of the line described in Schedule [1][22] to the said Act (therein and herein referred to as _the defined line_), and such part of the said land is the land described in the [Fourth][23] and [Fifteenth][24] Schedules to the said agreement: And whereas it is now necessary for the convenience of the shipping of the Harbour of Wellington that the Board should provide additional wharfage, and berthage accommodation for vessels whilst under repairs, and it has been ascertained that the only suitable position for portions of such accommodation is to the seaward of the defined line: And whereas, by reason of the Corporation not having completed the reclamation from the sea of the lands described in the said Act lying within the defined line, and being unwilling to immediately undertake such reclamation, the Board is unable to provide the necessary wharfage and berthage accommodation: And whereas by section four of the said recited Act certain land, being portion of the land described in the said grant, and being the land described in the [Thirteenth][25] Schedule to the said agreement, was, together with other land contiguous thereto, vested in the Board to be used for a graving-dock and slip, and for other purposes of a like nature or ancillary thereto, subject to the conditions expressed in the proviso to the said section: And whereas by a Proclamation dated the twelfth day of March, one thousand eight hundred and ninety-four, certain portions of the said land so vested in the Board as aforesaid by the said Act were taken for the extension of the Wellington-Napier Railway, whereby the area of the said land has been reduced: And whereas it is desirable for the purposes of the erection of the said additional wharfage and berthage accommodation, and also for the improvement of the Harbour of Wellington, that the land described in the said grant now remaining unreclaimed within the defined line should be reclaimed from the sea: And whereas by an Act of the General Assembly of New Zealand intituled The Wellington Harbour Board Loans Consolidation and Empowering Act 1884, the Board was empowered to construct within the Harbour of Wellington a basin, graving-dock, wet-dock, or slip, and also all works necessary for the convenient, proper, and efficient working of any such basin, graving-dock, wet-dock, or slip: And whereas it has been ascertained that, owing to the recent increase in the size and number of the vessels trading to the Port of Wellington, the land described in the said [Thirteenth][25] Schedule is insufficient in area for the purposes for which the same is vested in the Board: And whereas, for the purpose of obtaining a sufficient area of land for the construction thereon of the said works, and of other harbour-works, the Board and the Corporation on the thirteenth day of June, one thousand eight hundred and ninety-eight, duly entered into the agreement set out in Schedule [A][18] hereto: And whereas it is expedient that the necessary powers should be granted to enable the Board and the Corporation to carry out the said agreement, and that further powers should be respectively vested in the Board and the Corporation:

BE IT THEREFORE ENACTED by the General Assembly of New Zealand in Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:---
