*   (1) The Secretary must pay each territorial authority a share of the total levy money collected in respect of a financial year.
    
    (2) A territorial authority's share is calculated using the following formula:
    
    territorial authority's share = (levy collected − levy refunded)   
    × district's population
    
    2 total population
    
    where---
    
    levy collected is the total levy money collected in respect of the financial year
    
    levy refunded is the total levy money refunded in respect of the financial year in accordance with regulations made under [section 41(1)(k)][55]
    
    district's population is---
    
    (a)the population of the district of the territorial authority as shown by the census of population published most recently before the start of the financial year; or
    
    (b)if the district was constituted, or its boundaries were altered, after that census was published, the population of the district assessed by the Government Statistician as at the date of the district's constitution or boundary alteration
    
    total population is the total of all districts' populations.
    
    (3) The territorial authority's share must be paid to the territorial authority in the prescribed manner and at the prescribed times.
    
    (4) This section is subject to [section 33][44].

##### 32 Spending of levy money by territorial authorities
    
*   (1) A territorial authority may spend the levy money it receives under [section 31][42] only---
        
    *   (a) on matters to promote or achieve waste minimisation; and
    
    *   (b) in accordance with its waste management and minimisation plan.
    
    (2) When making a decision in relation to funding any matter to which subsection (1) applies, the territorial authority must consider the effects that the decision may have on any existing waste minimisation services, facilities, and activities (whether provided by the territorial authority or otherwise).

##### 33 Secretary must retain levy money instead of paying territorial authority in certain situations
    
*   (1) Despite [section 31][42], the Secretary must retain levy money payable to a territorial authority if,---
        
    *   (a) at the time the payment is to be made, the territorial authority has not---
            
        *   (i) adopted a waste management and minimisation plan; or
        
        *   (ii) reviewed its waste management and minimisation plan under [section 50][67], if a review was required before the time for payment; or

#### Estimated levy and unpaid levy

##### 34 Estimation of amount of levy payable

    *   (a) did not provide records or information in accordance with any prescribed requirement; or
    
    *   (b) provided records or information that the levy collector considers, on reasonable grounds, to be incomplete or incorrect.
    
    (2) The levy collector may,---
        
    *   (a) in the prescribed manner, estimate the amount of levy payable; and
    
    *   (b) make a written demand for the amount from the operator.
    
    (3) Once the written demand is made, the estimated amount must be treated as the correct amount of levy payable by the operator under [section 28][38].

##### 35 Interest on unpaid levy
    
*   (1) If the operator of a disposal facility does not fully pay an amount of levy (the _original amount_) by the close of the due day for payment, the levy owing is to be treated as having been increased by an amount calculated daily using the following formula:
    
    amount of increase = unpaid amount × prescribed rate
    
    where---
    
    unpaid amount is any part of the original amount that remains unpaid on the day of calculation
    
    prescribed rate has the same meaning as in [section 87(3)][121] of the Judicature Act 1908\.
    
    (2) Any amount of increase calculated under subsection (1) is not itself subject to an increase under that subsection.

##### 36 Unpaid levy is debt

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Waste Minimisation Act 2008\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 July 2013, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][170] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][171] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][172] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][173] and [17E][174] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
