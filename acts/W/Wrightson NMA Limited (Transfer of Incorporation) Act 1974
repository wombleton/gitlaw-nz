An Act to enable Wrightson NMA Limited to become a company deemed to be incorporated in New Zealand under the Companies Act 1955, and for other purposes incidental thereto
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    Whereas Wrightson NMA Limited (hereinafter referred to as the **Company**) is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom and is an existing company within the meaning of the Companies Acts, 1948 to 1967, of the United Kingdom and is a company limited by shares: 
    
    And whereas the Company was incorporated on 3 May 1877 under the Companies Act 1862 of the United Kingdom by the name of National Mortgage and Agency Company of New Zealand Limited and the name of the Company was changed to that which it now bears on 1 July 1972: 
    
    And whereas the Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Challenge Corporation Limited, which is an existing company within the meaning of the Companies Act 1955: 
    
    And whereas the Company carries on the business of stock and station agents in New Zealand and a wide variety of activities ancillary to the said business or connected therewith: 
    
    And whereas with a view to the more efficient and economical administration of the Company, and with the consent of all competent governmental authorities in the United Kingdom and in New Zealand, the central management and control of the Company's business ceased on 4 February 1969 to be exercised in the United Kingdom and has since that date been exercised in New Zealand, and since the said date the Company has been deemed to be resident in New Zealand within the meaning of Part 6 of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954: 
    
    And whereas having regard to the fact that the area of operation of the Company is wholly in New Zealand and having regard to the circumstances described in the immediately preceding recital, it is considered expedient and advantageous to the Company and its holding company if the Company were deemed to be incorporated under the laws of New Zealand instead of the laws of England: 
    
    And whereas no procedure exists whereby the registration of a company which has been incorporated in the United Kingdom can be transferred to New Zealand: 
    
    And whereas procedure by way of winding up and dissolution of the Company and the transfer or sale of assets to a new company incorporated in New Zealand would involve loss of identity of the Company and the disturbance of its financial structure and would interfere with the continuity of its operations with considerable attendant expense and delay: 
    
    And whereas it is desirable that the Company should be enabled to become a company incorporated under the Companies Act 1955 without any such loss of identity, disturbance, or interference: 
    
    And whereas a Bill has been introduced into the Parliament of the United Kingdom for the purpose of enabling the Company to transfer its registered office from England to New Zealand and for the cesser of application to the Company of provisions of the Companies Acts, 1948 to 1967, of the United Kingdom: 
    
    And whereas it is expedient that such provisions should be enacted as are in this Act contained: 
    
    And whereas the objects of this Act cannot be attained without the authority of Parliament.

For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][11] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][12] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][14] and [17E][15] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
