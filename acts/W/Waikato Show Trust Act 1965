## Schedule 2  
Board of Control: Constitution and delegated powers

##### 1
    
*   The Board of Control shall consist of 9 persons of whom the Trust Board shall nominate 3 and the 2 constituent associations 3 each. At the expiration of 3 years computed as from the date of the passing of this Act and annually thereafter 1 member from each of the 3 groups shall retire but shall be eligible for renomination. The order of retirement in each group shall be governed by length of service but in cases where this presents difficulty of application ballot shall be resorted to, it being the intention of this Act that each nominee shall hold office continuously for at least 3 years before being required to retire.

##### 2
    
*   In the event of the Trust Board or either constituent association passing a resolution to the effect that any 1 or more of the persons nominated by any of them respectively no longer enjoy the confidence of the Trust Board or either constituent association, as the case may be, then the Board of Control, upon the receipt of a copy of such resolution and upon being satisfied that there are good and sufficient grounds for such resolution, may declare the seat or seats of the member or members affected to be vacant and such vacancies shall be deemed to be casual within the meaning of the next succeeding paragraph.

##### 3
    
*   In the event of a casual vacancy arising by reason of the death, resignation, refusal to act, or retirement from any cause, of a member of the Board of Control then the body by whom such member was nominated shall fill the vacancy so created and may do so immediately or at any time thereafter.

##### 4
    
*   The members of the Board of Control shall from time to time appoint a Chairman, who shall preside at all meetings. Except with the consent of all the nominees for the time being of the Trust Board, the Chairman shall be one of such nominees. In case of the absence of the Chairman from any meeting the members then present shall appoint a Chairman for that meeting, who shall be one of the nominees for the time being of the Trust Board, if any such nominee or nominees is or are present at such meeting.

##### 5
    
*   The Board of Control shall meet for the dispatch of business as often as it shall deem necessary. It shall be the duty of the Chairman to convene a meeting upon receiving a requisition in writing from any 3 members.
    
    If the Chairman is for any reason not available or fails forthwith upon receipt of such requisition to convene a meeting, then any 3 members may themselves convene a meeting. The Chairman shall also have the right to convene a meeting at any time.

##### 6
    
*   Except in the case of what in the opinion of the Chairman is an emergency meeting, not less than 3 days' notice of any meeting shall be given. Notice of any meeting shall be given by post unless the Chairman is of opinion that it is not reasonably practicable so to do. Any notice given by post shall be deemed to have been received by the member to whom it was addressed at the time when such notice would ordinarily be delivered in the ordinary course of post and shall be deemed sufficiently given if addressed to the member concerned at his address last known to the Chairman of the Board of Control. It shall not be necessary for any such notice to give particulars of the business intended to be transacted at the meeting.

##### 7
    
*   At all meetings of the Board of Control 5 shall form a quorum, and the Chairman shall have a casting as well as a deliberative vote. Every matter shall be determined by a majority.

##### 8
    
*   During the continuance of the trusts set out in subsection (1) of [section 7][9], and save as otherwise expressly provided to the contrary by this Act, the custody, management, and control of the Trust property shall, as from the passing of the Act, be vested in the Board of Control.

##### 9
    
*   Without limiting the rights and powers of the Board of Control, as custodians, managers, and controllers of the Trust property, it is hereby declared that the primary duty and function of the Board of Control is to use and administer the lands from time to time comprised in the Trust property and the grandstand, buildings, structures, fences, and appointments from time to time within, upon, or about the said lands (herein referred to as the **showgrounds**) to the best advantage of the 2 constituent associations and to maintain and care for the showgrounds for such purposes.

##### 10
    
*   In the succeeding clauses of this schedule:
        
    *   (a) the expression _current liabilities_ means all liabilities of the Trust Board which from time to time have fallen due for payment but are unpaid, saving only any liability for the repayment of the principal moneys comprised in any loan of moneys:
    
    *   (b) the expression _current assets_ means all assets of the Trust Board for the time being.
    
    

##### 11
    
*   The Board of Control shall punctually pay and discharge the current liabilities of the Trust Board, and except as may otherwise be specially arranged between the Trust Board and the Board of Control shall for that purpose use only the current assets of the Trust Board save and except that the Board of Control may have recourse to such borrowing as is authorised by [paragraph 2][31] of Part 2 of Schedule 3 and to levying as provided in [paragraph 15][32]. The costs and disbursements incidental to the preparation and promotion of this Act shall be a liability of the Trust Board.

##### 12
    
*   Except with the previous consent of the Trust Board, the Board of Control shall exercise reasonable care not to incur any liability the discharge of which will probably involve recourse to the sale of land comprised in the Trust property or to the raising of money by the exercise of any borrowing powers (other than that conferred by [paragraph 2][31] of Part 2 of Schedule 3), or to any general reserve constituted for the time being under [paragraph 13][33].

##### 13
    
*   If the Trust Board is at any time or times of the opinion, upon reasonable grounds, that any moneys or investments are not immediately required by the Board of Control for the payment of current liabilities, then the Trust Board may resolve that such moneys or investments be constituted a general reserve. It shall be the duty of the Board of Control to apply the moneys and investments comprised in the general reserve in or towards the payment of such liabilities of the Trust Board, whether current or otherwise, as the Trust Board may from time to time resolve, and it shall not be lawful for the Board of Control to expend any of such moneys otherwise than in pursuance of such a resolution. The Trust Board may at any time require the Board of Control to keep any moneys forming part of the general reserve in a separate bank account. The Trust Board may at any time resolve that any part of the general reserve shall cease to be part of the general reserve.

##### 14
    
*   The Board of Control may at any time give an undertaking to the Trust Board to set aside and apply to any specific purpose any part of the revenues and/or levies received by it in carrying out its duty hereunder or any part of the current assets of the Trust Board, and it shall thereupon be the duty of the Board of Control to exercise reasonable care to carry out any such undertaking and any moneys so set aside shall not be applied to any other purpose except with the consent of the Trust Board.

##### 15
    
*   During the annual Summer Show held by the Waikato Agricultural and Pastoral Association and the annual Winter Show held by the Waikato Winter Show Association the Board of Control shall delegate to the respective constituent association the exclusive use and management of the showgrounds, gates, and stands and the collection of the revenue therefrom and from the said show, whether by way of entrance fee paid by exhibitors, licence fees paid by sideshowmen, or otherwise, and the said constituent association shall during any such show in its absolute discretion admit or exclude from the showgrounds such persons upon such terms as it may think proper. The respective constituent associations may retain the proceeds from its said show and after payment of all accounts incurred therewith shall furnish to the Board of Control no later than 30 days after such show a profit and loss account showing the net profit (if any) arising therefrom and the said Board shall have power to levy the profits of the particular constituent association for the proper and efficient carrying out of the custody, control, and management of the showgrounds. In every case where such delegation of powers shall be made the constituent association acting thereunder shall be deemed to be the agent of the Trust Board and shall be accountable as such subject to the foregoing provisions of this paragraph.

##### 16
    
*   The Books of Accounts required by this Act to be kept by the Board of Control for and on behalf of the Trust Board shall be open to inspection by the 2 constituent associations at all reasonable times. The financial year of the Trust Board shall commence on 1 May every year and close on 30 April of the following year, and the Board of Control shall on or before 15 June in each year supply each of them, the Trust Board, and the 2 constituent associations with 3 copies of the annual report, statement of financial position, and profit and loss account covering the year just ended.
    
    Schedule 2 clause 16: amended, on 1 October 1997, pursuant to [section 6(1)][34] of the Financial Reporting Amendment Act 1997 (1997 No 17).

##### 17
    
*   All questions, disputes, and differences whatsoever which may at any time or times hereafter arise between the Trust Board, the Board of Control, the Waikato Agricultural and Pastoral Association, and the Waikato Winter Show Association or any 2 or more of them, concerning the proper meaning and construction of any paragraph of this schedule, or any of them (with any variations, modifications, or additions made thereto from time to time) or concerning the rights or obligations of any of them under such paragraphs, or any of them, shall be referred to arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Act 1908 or any amendment thereto or re-enactment thereof for the time being in force. Any reference to arbitration under this paragraph of this schedule shall be to a single arbitrator to be agreed to by all parties to the dispute or difference. In the event of the parties failing to agree upon the appointment of an arbitrator within 7 days after any party to the dispute or difference has called upon the other party or parties by notice in writing to agree upon the appointment of a person named in such notice then any party to the dispute or difference may apply to the President for the time being of the Hamilton District Law Society who may thereupon appoint an arbitrator who shall have the like powers to act in the reference and make an award as if he had been appointed by consent of all parties.

*   4If at any time during the continuance of the trusts set out in subsection (1) of [section 7][9] the number of trustees shall be less than 5 and the Trust Board shall fail for a period of 6 months after being requested so to do by either or both the Waikato Agricultural and Pastoral Association and Waikato Winter Show Association to bring the number up to 5, then the associations may jointly appoint a new trustee or new trustees, as the case may be, and in case the associations cannot agree upon any such appointment then either may apply to the President for the time being of the Hamilton District Law Society for the purpose of having such appointment made.

*   5On an application made to the President for the time being of the Hamilton District Law Society under the preceding [paragraph 4][35] he may require notice of such application to be given to such person, bodies, or organisations as he thinks fit.

*   6Notwithstanding that the number of trustees may fall below 9, the trustees for the time being, not being less in number than 5, may act for all purposes. If and whenever the number of trustees shall fall below 5, then the remaining trustees or trustee may act for the purpose of appointing additional trustees to bring the total number of trustees up to 5\.

*   7The office of trustee shall become and be vacant in each of the following cases in addition to death, that is to say, if the trustee---
        
    *   *   (a) by notice in writing to the Trust Board resigns his office:
        
        *   (b) refuses to act further:
        
        *   (c) becomes of unsound mind or becomes a protected person under the Protection of Personal and Property Rights Act:
        
        *   (d) becomes bankrupt or enters into a composition with or assignment for the benefit of his creditors:
        
        *   (e) is absent without leave from 3 consecutive meetings of the Trust Board.
        
        
    
    

*   8Upon the occurrence of a vacancy in the office of trustee the Trust Board shall at its next meeting cause a note thereof to be entered into the Minute Book. In like manner the Trust Board shall cause a note to be entered in the Minute Book of the entry into office of every new trustee.

*   9All acts done by any meeting of the Trust Board or of a committee thereof or by any person acting as a trustee shall, notwithstanding that it be afterwards discovered that there was some defect in the appointment of any trustee or person acting as aforesaid, be as valid as if every such person had been duly appointed. In like manner all such acts aforesaid shall not be invalidated if it be afterwards discovered that any trustee had vacated his office under the provisions of [paragraph 7][36] of this schedule.

*   10Except where by this Act the Trust Board is required to act by means of a special resolution, every matter shall be determined by the majority of the trustees present and voting on the question. The Chairman shall have a casting vote, whether or not he shall have previously voted on the same question. There shall be a quorum when 5 trustees are present at any meeting, but this provision shall not be construed as limiting the provisions of [paragraph 6][37] of this schedule whereby a lesser number of trustees may act for the purpose of filling up vacancies.

*   11Where by this Act any matter is required to be dealt with by the Trust Board by special resolution, then the expression _special resolution_ shall mean a resolution passed by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members for the time being of the Trust Board at a meeting of the Trust Board of which not less than 21 days' notice, specifying the intention to propose the resolution as a special resolution, has been duly given. Alternatively, a special resolution may be passed, without a meeting of the Trust Board or any previous notice being required, by means of an entry in the Minute Book signed by at least two-thirds of the members for the time being. Any such entry may be signed on behalf of a trustee by his agent duly authorised in writing. For the purpose of this paragraph a member who is for the time being out of New Zealand shall not be counted as a member for the time being of the Trust Board. A copy of every special resolution shall be posted to each trustee by the Secretary to the Trust Board within a reasonable time after the passing of such resolution.

*   12The Trust Board shall hold a general meeting at least once in each year at such time and in such place in the City of Hamilton or within a convenient distance therefrom as the Trust Board shall appoint. Such meeting shall be called the annual general meeting.

*   13The Chairman or any 2 trustees may at any time summon a special meeting for any cause that seems to him or them to be sufficient.

*   14During the continuance of the trusts set out in subsection (1) of [section 7][9] the Board of Control shall have the right on not more than 4 occasions in any 1 year to call upon the Chairman of the Trust Board or any 2 trustees to summon a special meeting of the Trust Board for the purpose of considering any specific matter or matters which the Board of Control may resolve should be considered by the Trust Board. Upon receipt of such a request conveyed to him or them by any authorised representative of the Board of Control, the Chairman or the 2 trustees, as the case may be, shall summon a special meeting of the Trust Board accordingly.

*   15Notice in writing of every meeting, whether general, special, or adjourned, shall be delivered or sent through the post to each trustee by the Secretary or by some other person acting under the direction of the Trust Board, or, in the case of a special meeting, by or under the direction of the person or persons summoning the meeting, 3 clear days at least before the date of the meeting; so far, however, in the case of an adjourned meeting as the interval between the original and adjourned meeting will permit. Every notice of meeting shall state the place, day, and hour of the meeting, and every notice of a special meeting shall further state the matters to be discussed thereat. In so far as it is intended at any meeting to propose any resolution as a special resolution, then the provisions of this paragraph shall be read subject to the provisions of [paragraph 11][38] of this schedule.

*   16If a quorum shall not have assembled within half an hour after the time appointed for any meeting, the trustee or trustees present, or the Secretary (if no trustee be present), may adjourn the meeting. Any meeting may be adjourned by the Chairman upon the adoption of a resolution for its adjournment.

*   17The Trustees shall from time to time appoint a Chairman, who shall preside at all meetings. In the case of the absence of the Chairman from that meeting the trustees then present shall elect a Chairman for that meeting.

*   18Any resolution of the Trust Board may be rescinded or varied from time to time by the Trust Board at a special meeting, but a special resolution shall not be rescinded or varied except by a special resolution.

*   19(1)A Minute Book shall be provided and kept by the Trust Board. Minutes of all proceedings of the Trust Board and any committee thereof shall be entered in the Minute Book.
    
    (2)Any such minute, if purporting to be signed by the Chairman of the meeting at which the proceedings were had, or by the Chairman of the next succeeding meeting, shall be evidence of the proceedings.
    
    (3)Where minutes have been made in accordance with the provisions of this rule of the proceedings at any meeting of the Trust Board then, until the contrary is proved, the meeting shall be deemed to have been duly held and convened and all proceedings had thereat to have been duly had.
    
    

*   20The Trust Board shall keep full and accurate accounts of all the receipts, disbursements, assets, liabilities, and engagements of the Trust Board and shall in every year cause the same to be audited by a public accountant. During the continuance of the trusts set forth in subsection (1) of [section 7][9] the foregoing duty of the Trust Board shall by virtue of this Act be delegated to and carried out by the Board of Control; but the trustees and any of them shall at all reasonable times be entitled in person or by their authorised agent to access to the said accounts, and the audited accounts shall in every year be made available to the Trust Board at its annual general meeting for consideration and if thought fit for adoption by the Trust Board.

*   21The trustees shall have and use a common seal for the affairs and business of the Trust Board, and may from time to time change, alter, or make new such seal as they may think fit. If and whenever the Board of Control acting within its powers and duties set out in [Schedule 2][23] shall enter into any transaction requiring the use of the common seal, then such seal may be affixed to all necessary documents pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Control and in the presence of not less than 2 members of the Board of Control and the Secretary, and if joint Secretaries either Secretary. In all other cases the common seal shall not be affixed to any instrument except with the authority of a resolution of the Trust Board and in the presence of any 2 trustees and the Secretary and if joint Secretaries either Secretary.

*   22Contracts on behalf of the Trust Board may be made, varied, or discharged as follows:
*   Any contract which, if made between private persons---
*   firstly, must be in writing under seal:
*   secondly, must be in writing signed by the parties thereto:
*   thirdly, may be made verbally without writing:
*   When made on behalf of the Trust Board---
*   in the first case shall be in writing under the common seal of the Trust Board attested by any 2 trustees and the Secretary and if joint Secretaries either Secretary or any 2 members of the Board of Control and the Secretary and if joint Secretaries either Secretary, as the case may be:
*   in the second case, shall be in writing signed by any person in the name and on behalf of the Trust Board acting under a resolution passed at a meeting of the Trust Board, or of the Board of Control, as the case may be:
*   in the third case, may be verbally without writing by any persons in the name and on behalf of the Trust Board acting under a resolution passed at a meeting of the Trust Board, or of the Board of Control, as the case may be.

*   23The Trust Board shall appoint in the first instance the Secretary of each of the 2 constituent associations as joint Secretaries at such remuneration or remunerations as it from time to time thinks fit.

*   Schedule 3 Part 1 paragraph 7(c): amended, on 1 October 1988, pursuant to [section 113][39] of the Protection of Personal and Property Rights Act 1988 (1988 No 4).

## Part 2

*   2 To open and operate 1 or more banking accounts, with power to borrow on overdraft.

*   3 To purchase and from time to time to sell or exchange such plant and equipment as may be reasonably necessary in connection with the maintenance and upkeep of the Trust property or the management of the affairs of the Trust.

*   4 To employ all such persons as may be reasonably necessary for the proper and efficient carrying out of the custody, control, and management of the Trust property.

This power may from time to time be sub-delegated by the Board of Control to a committee comprising 1 or more of its own members together with such other person or persons (if any) as may be deemed expedient from time to time by the Board of Control. Any such sub-delegation shall be revocable by the Board of Control at any time.

## Part 3  
Powers of the Trust Board which during the continuance of the trusts set forth in subsection (1) of section 7 shall be exercisable only by the Trust Board
    
*   1 To purchase, take on lease or under a tenancy, or otherwise acquire any additional land capable of being used in connection with the Trust property.

*   2 To accept gifts of any property to be held by the Trust Board upon the trust set forth in this Act.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Waikato Show Trust Act 1965\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 October 1997, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][40] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][41] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][42] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][43] and [17E][44] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
