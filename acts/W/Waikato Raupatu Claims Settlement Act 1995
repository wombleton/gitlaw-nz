    Whereas---
        
    *   A the Treaty of Waitangi is set out, in Maori and in English, in [Schedule 1][54]:
    
    *   ###### Kiingitanga
    
    *   B in 1858 Pootatau Te Wherowhero was raised up as King to unite the iwi, and preserve their rangatiratanga and their economic and cultural integrity, under his authority in the face of increasing settler challenges, Waikato regarding themselves as principal kaitiaki of the Kiingitanga and as remaining so ever since:
    
    *   C those chiefs who formally pledged their land to Pootatau Te Wherowhero gave up ultimate authority over the land to him, along with ultimate responsibility for the well-being of the people, and through this bound their communities to the Kiingitanga, resisting further alienation of their land:
    
    *   D the New Zealand Government at the time perceived the Kiingitanga as a challenge to the Queen's sovereignty and as a hindrance to Government land purchase policies, and did not agree to any role for, or formal relationship with, the Kiingitanga:
    
    *   ###### Invasion, hostilities, and confiscations of Waikato land
    
    *   E in July 1863, after considered preparations by the New Zealand Government, military forces of the Crown unjustly invaded the Waikato south of the Mangatawhiri river, initiating hostilities against the Kiingtanga and the people. By April 1864, after persistent defence of their lands, Waikato and their allies had fallen back before the larger forces of the Crown and had taken refuge in the King Country:
    
    *   F by Orders in Council under the New Zealand Settlements Act 1863, the Crown unjustly confiscated approximately 1.2 million acres of land from the Tainui iwi in order to punish them and gain control of the land placed by them under the protection of the Kiingitanga (although the Crown subsequently paid small amounts of monetary compensation and returned, by Crown grants, but not under customary title and generally not to those who had fought for the Kiingitanga, approximately one-quarter of the land confiscated):
    
    *   G widespread suffering, distress, and deprivation were caused to the Waikato iwi (both north and south of the Mangatawhiri river) as a result of the war waged against them, the loss of life, the destruction of their taonga and property, and the confiscations of their lands, and the effects of the Raupatu have lasted for generations:
    
    *   H the Kiingitanga has continued to sustain the people since the Raupatu, and its leaders have petitioned the Crown for justice and for the return of land since 1865:
    
    *   ###### Royal Commission
    
    *   I a Royal Commission (the Sim Commission) was appointed in 1926 to consider the confiscations under the New Zealand Settlements Act 1863 and its amendments:
    
    *   J in response to the Sim Commission's findings and recommendations, compensation was granted pursuant to the Waikato-Maniapoto Maori Claims Settlement Act 1946 by the payment of an annual sum of money into the Tainui Maori Trust Fund, to be administered by the Tainui Maori Trust Board for the benefit of those members of the Maori tribes in the Waikato District whose lands had been confiscated:
    
    *   ###### Waitangi Tribunal
    
    *   K in 1985 the Waitangi Tribunal wrote in the Manukau Report (Wai 8) at page 17: ""It can simply be said that from the contemporary record of Sir John Gorst in 1864, from the Report of the Royal Commission sixty years after that, and from historical research almost a century removed from the event, all sources agree that the Tainui people of the Waikato never rebelled but were attacked by British troops in direct violation of Article II of the Treaty of Waitangi"":
    
    *   L on 16 March 1987 Robert Te Kotahi Mahuta, on behalf of himself and on behalf of the members of Waikato-Tainui, the Tainui Maori Trust Board, and Ngaa Marae Toopu, submitted a claim to the Waitangi Tribunal under the [Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975][58] in relation to the Raupatu, that claim being registered with the Waitangi Tribunal as Wai 30:
    
    *   ###### Court of Appeal
    
    *   M the injustice of the Raupatu is as keenly felt by Waikato today as in the past, as has been testified by Waikato kaumaatua and kuia in the affidavits filed by the plaintiffs in _R T Mahuta and Tainui Maori Trust Board v Attorney-General_ \[1989\] 2 NZLR 513:
    
    *   N the Court of Appeal noted in that case that the Sim Commission's report had failed to convey ""...an expressed sense of the crippling impact of Raupatu on the welfare, economy and potential development of Tainui"", and that the subsequent annual monetary payments made by the Government were trivial ""in present day money values"", and concluded that ""Some form of more real and constructive compensation is obviously called for if the Treaty is to be honoured"":
    
    *   ###### Negotiations with the Crown
    
    *   O in 1989 the Crown and Waikato entered into direct negotiations in which Waikato pursued compensation on the basis of their long established principles of ""land for land""---""i riro whenua atu, me hoki whenua mai"" (""as land was taken, land must be returned"") and ""ko te moni hei utu mo te hara"" (""the money is the acknowledgment by the Crown of their crime""):
    
    *   P in 1993 as a goodwill gesture the Crown vested the Hopuhopu Military Base in Pootatau Te Wherowhero for the benefit of Waikato:
    
    *   Q the Crown and Waikato have negotiated with each other in good faith in an endeavour to settle the Waikato claim and to remove the sense of grievance felt over time by Waikato:
    
    *   ###### Settlement of claims
    
    *   R the Crown now acknowledges that grave injustice was done to Waikato when the Crown, in breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi][59], sent its forces into the Waikato, occupied and subsequently confiscated Waikato land, and unfairly labelled Waikato as rebels:
    
    *   S after---
            
        *   (a) the Crown and Waikato had considered the [Treaty of Waitangi][59], the particular terms of reference of the Sim Commission, the findings and recommendations made by the Sim Commission in accordance with those terms of reference, and the compensation already paid or provided to Waikato (including the compensation provided in response to the findings and recommendations of the Sim Commission) and had agreed on the inadequacy of that compensation; and
        
        *   (b) the Crown had recognised the significance of the ""land for land"" principle to Waikato; and
        
        *   (c) the Crown and Waikato had agreed that the Crown should now make full and final restitution to Waikato in respect of the Raupatu claims,---
        
        the Crown and Robert Te Kotahi Mahuta on behalf of Waikato-Tainui, accordingly recorded, on 21 December 1994, in a heads of agreement their agreement in principle to the matters required to effect a settlement of those claims, and, on 22 May 1995, the Crown and Waikato-Tainui signed a deed of settlement (a copy of which is now contained in Paper E3 of the Appendix to the Journals of the House of Representatives 1995):
    
    *   T the text, in Maori and in English, of the apology given by the Crown to Waikato in the deed of settlement is recorded in [Part 1][6]:
    
    *   U land transferred to Waikato under the deed of settlement will be held communally in a trust to be established by Waikato and part of that land will be registered in the name of Pootatau Te Wherowhero as provided for in this Act, that name giving expression to the significance of the pledges made by the chiefs to Pootatau Te Wherowhero and of the reaffirmations of those pledges, as expressed in the kawenata, by those who have continued in support of the Kiingitanga:
    
    *   V the trust deed for the trust to be established by Waikato will provide that no land of the trust that is registered in the name of Pootatau Te Wherowhero shall be sold or mortgaged to, or be capable of being vested in or transferred to, any person or body, and that no land may be transferred out of the name of Pootatau Te Wherowhero without the consent of the ""custodians of Te Wherowhero title"" referred to in that trust deed:
    
    *   W as the Crown now holds only a small proportion of the land originally confiscated and the land now held cannot be evenly distributed among the 33 hapu affected by the Raupatu, the restitution provided for in the deed of settlement is to be for the benefit of all Waikato collectively, under the mana of the Kiingitanga:
    
    *   X by the deed of settlement---
            
        *   (a) the Crown has acknowledged that the settlement provided for in that deed does not diminish or in any way affect the [Treaty of Waitangi][59] or any of its articles or the ongoing relationship between the Crown and Waikato in terms of the Treaty of Waitangi or undermine any rights under the Treaty of Waitangi, including rangatiratanga rights; and
        
        *   (b) Waikato have acknowledged that the settlement provided for in that deed is fair, final, and durable.

E noho pani tonu nei raatou i roto i te rawakoretanga me to hauwareatanga o ngaa mahi toko i te ora, o ngaa mahi whanaketanga mo ngaa Iwi o Waikato.
    
    "4 E maarama pai ana Te Karauna teeraa ko teenei pouritanga tino toimaha, kaaore nei anoo kia whakatikaina i raro i te [Tiriti o Waitangi][59] kei te whakataairi i eenei puutake e rua a Waikato: 'i riro whenua atu, me hoki whenua mai' te tuatahi; 'ko te moni hei utu mo te hara' te tuarua. Hei whakatutuki, e whakaae ana Te Karauna ki te whakahoki ki te iwi ngaa whenua e taea ai i roto i teenei whakaaetanga kei raro i toona mana i Waikato.
    
    "5 E whakaae ana Te Karauna teeraa anoo ngaa whenua raupatu o Waikato te tino taakoha nui ki te rangatiratanga me te whanaketanga o Niu Tireni ahakoa kei te noho rawakore tonu te Iwi o Waikato i oona whenua me ngaa hua o aua whenua.

##### 6 Text in English
    
*   The text of the apology in English is as follows:
    
    "1 The Crown acknowledges that its representatives and advisers acted unjustly and in breach of the Treaty of Waitangi in its dealings with the Kiingitanga and Waikato in sending its forces across the Mangataawhiri in July 1863 and in unfairly labelling Waikato as rebels.
    
    "2 The Crown expresses its profound regret and apologises unreservedly for the loss of lives because of the hostilities arising from its invasion, and at the devastation of property and social life which resulted.
    
    "3 The Crown acknowledges that the subsequent confiscations of land and resources under the New Zealand Settlements Act 1863 of the New Zealand Parliament were wrongful, have caused Waikato to the present time to suffer feelings in relation to their lost lands akin to those of orphans, and have had a crippling impact on the welfare, economy and development of Waikato.
    
    "4 The Crown appreciates that this sense of grief, the justice of which under the [Treaty of Waitangi][59] has remained unrecognised, has given rise to Waikato's two principles 'i riro whenua atu, me hoki whenua mai' (as land was taken, land should be returned) and 'ko to moni hei utu mo te hara' (the money is the acknowledgment by the Crown of their crime). In order to provide redress the Crown has agreed to return as much land as is possible that the Crown has in its possession to Waikato.
    
    "5 The Crown recognises that the lands confiscated in the Waikato have made a significant contribution to the wealth and development of New Zealand, whilst the Waikato tribe has been alienated from its lands and deprived of the benefit of its lands.
    
    "6 Accordingly, the Crown seeks on behalf of all New Zealanders to atone for these acknowledged injustices, so far as that is now possible, and, with the grievance of raupatu finally settled as to the matters set out in the Deed of Settlement signed on 22 May 1995 to begin the process of healing and to enter a new age of co-operation with the Kiingitanga and Waikato."

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Waikato Raupatu Claims Settlement Act 1995\. It incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 23 May 2008, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][127] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][128] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][129] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][130] and [17E][131] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
