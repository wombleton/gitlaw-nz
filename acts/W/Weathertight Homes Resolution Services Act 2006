    (4) This section is intended as a guide only.

##### 7 Representative claims in respect of multi-unit complexes: other relevant procedural provisions
    
*   (1) Under [section 23][29], if the rules, constitution, or lease requires more than 80% of owners to agree to a decision that relates to bringing, managing, or resolving a claim, or to an administrative decision relating to the claim, only 80% of owners are required to agree to the decision.
    
    (2) Under [section 26][33], further owners may join a multi-unit complex claim under [section 19][24] or [21][26] before, or with the tribunal's consent after, adjudication is initiated.
    
    (3) Under [section 28][35], the owner of a dwellinghouse in a multi-unit complex may, at any time and by written notice to the representative, withdraw from a multi-unit complex claim under [section 19][24] or [21][26]. The withdrawal does not affect the ability of the representative to continue with the claim.
    
    (4) Under [section 29][36], the representative in a [section 19][24] or [21][26] claim must notify the chief executive or tribunal (as applicable) of any change of ownership of a dwellinghouse.

    (5) Under [sections 52][65] and [53][66], the chief executive and the tribunal must terminate the following claims in the following circumstances:
        
    *   (a) a claim in respect of a single dwellinghouse in a multi-unit complex that is not a stand-alone complex (under [section 15][18]) when a claim is brought in respect of, or certain penetration of water is likely to have damaged, 1 or more other dwellinghouses, or common areas, in the complex:
    
    *   (b) a common areas only claim (under [section 17][20]) when a claim is brought in respect of, or certain penetration of water is likely to have damaged, 1 or more dwellinghouses in the complex:
    
    *   (c) a stand-alone complex claim (under [section 18][21]) when a claim is brought in respect of, or certain penetration of water is likely to have damaged, 1 or more common areas in the complex.
    
    (6) Under [section 30][38], for the purposes of representative claims in respect of a multi-unit complex, this Act applies, unless the context otherwise requires, as if---

#### Lower-value claims

##### 51 Overview of procedures for lower-value claims
    
*   (1) Under [section 80(2)][99], a claimant with a lower-value claim may, with the consent of any of the other parties, refer it directly to mediation under this Act if---
        
    *   (a) the claimant has applied to the chief executive in the manner required by that subsection for lower-value claims dispute resolution assistance; and
    
    *   (b) no application has yet been made to the tribunal to have the claim adjudicated.
    
    (2) Under [section 60(7)][76], if a claim is a lower-value claim, a claimant who would otherwise have the right under section 60(1) to apply to the tribunal to have the claim adjudicated must not apply to have the claim adjudicated unless the claimant has---
        
    *   (a) applied under [section 80(2)(a)][99] for lower-value claims dispute resolution assistance; and
    
    *   (b) received from the chief executive a certificate that he or she is satisfied that the claimant has made reasonable attempts to resolve the claim under the lower-value claims dispute resolution assistance process.
    
    (3) Under [section 83][102], if, in any particular case, no application has yet been made to the tribunal to have a lower-value claim adjudicated, the chief executive may, if satisfied that the parties are near resolution of, and likely to resolve, the dispute, if allowed more time, allow for the claim a maximum period of mediation longer than the period stated in [section 82][101].
    
    (4) [Section 58][73] states aims that the tribunal must try to achieve in relation to the adjudication of a lower-value claim.
    
    (5) Under [section 59][74], the following apply to the adjudication of a lower-value claim:
        
    *   (a) requirements to deal with the claim on the papers and not to hold a hearing or a preliminary conference, unless it is for some reason appropriate or necessary to hold one; and
    
    *   (b) a restriction on the tribunal approving the referral of the claim to mediation.
    
    (6) Under [section 90(5)][111], the fact that a claim is a lower-value claim does not prevent the value of the tribunal's determination from exceeding the lower-value ceiling.
    
    (7) This section is intended as a guide only.

### Subpart 5---Adjudication of claims

#### Nature of adjudication proceedings, and aims and procedure for lower-value claims

##### 57 Adjudications to be managed to achieve purpose of Act
    
*   (1) The tribunal must manage adjudication proceedings in a manner that tends best to ensure that they are speedy, flexible, and cost-effective; and, in particular, must---
        
    *   (a) encourage parties where possible to work together on matters that are agreed; and
    
    *   (b) use, and allow the use of, experts and expert evidence only where necessary; and
    
    *   (c) try to use conferences of experts to avoid duplication of evidence on matters that are or are likely to be agreed; and
    
    *   (d) try to prevent unnecessary or irrelevant evidence or cross-examination.
    
    (2) In managing adjudication proceedings, the tribunal must comply with the principles of natural justice.
    
    (3) Subsection (2) does not require the tribunal to permit the cross-examination of a party or person; but the tribunal may in its absolute discretion do so.

##### 58 Aims in relation to adjudication of lower-value claims
    
*   (1) The tribunal must try to achieve the following aims in relation to the adjudication of a lower-value claim:
        
    *   (a) ensure that the process is much faster, simpler, and cheaper than the adjudication of a claim that is not a lower-value claim:
    
    *   (b) minimise the involvement of lawyers and other representatives:
    
    *   (c) keep the cost of the process at a level appropriate to the amount of the claim:
    
    *   (d) handle procedural issues (like joining parties) quickly and efficiently, and in particular (where possible) avoid, or at least minimise, the need for submissions on them:
    
    *   (e) minimise the adducing of evidence other than the assessor's report and evidence as to actual repair costs:
    
    *   (f) maximise the use of informal means to resolve the dispute.
    
    (2) Subsection (1) is subject to [sections 57(2)][72] and [68][86], but overrides anything to the contrary in [subparts 5][70], [7][108], [8][124], and [9][144] of this Part and [Part 2][247] of Schedule 3\.

        *   (i) the cost of repairing the damage in respect of which the claim is brought is, or is likely to be, above the lower-value ceiling; or
        
        *   (ii) for some other reason it is appropriate to hold a hearing:
        
        
    
    *   (b) a preliminary conference must not be held unless the tribunal is satisfied that it is necessary to hold one:
    
    *   (c) the tribunal must not approve referring the claim to mediation unless satisfied that it is highly likely that the claim will be resolved by mediation.
    
    (2) Subsection (1) overrides anything to the contrary in [subparts 5][70], [7][108], [8][124], and [9][144] of this Part and [Part 2][247] of Schedule 3\.

    *   (b) the work needed to make the dwellinghouse concerned weathertight and repair the damage in respect of which the claim is brought has been done, and the claimant holds receipts for all payments required to be made for that work.

    *   (a) the claimant must notify the tribunal; and
    
    *   (b) that notification is to be treated as a notice of withdrawal under [section 67][85], and that section applies accordingly.

    (4) The tribunal may determine that the liability of a party to the adjudication depends on another party to that adjudication meeting any conditions that the tribunal may impose.

    (4) A claimant may abandon so much of a claim to which an appeal relates as exceeds $200,000 in order to bring the appeal within the jurisdiction of the District Court.
    
    (5) If an appeal is commenced by a person who is required to pay money to a party to a claim, the person may bring the appeal within the jurisdiction of the District Court by paying the other person the difference between the amount required to be paid under the determination and $200,000\.

    (4) A certificate signed by a member and to the effect that a copy of that kind is a true copy of the record or paper to which the certificate relates is, in the absence of proof to the contrary, sufficient evidence that the copy is a true copy of that record or paper.
    
    (5) _Relevant fee_, in relation to the public inspection, or to the supply of a true copy, of a record or paper, under this section, means the fee (if any) prescribed by regulations made under the [District Courts Act 1947][292] as payable in respect of civil proceedings under that Act or other Acts for the search of a document, or for a copy of any notes, judgment, or order, or of any other document, respectively.

*   (1) Every person attending before a member on a summons, and every other person giving evidence before the tribunal, is entitled, subject to subclause (2), to be paid, by the party calling that person, witnesses' fees, allowances, and travelling expenses according to the scales for the time being prescribed by regulations made under the [Summary Proceedings Act 1957][336], and those regulations apply accordingly.
    
    (2) The tribunal may disallow the whole or any part of any sum payable under subclause (1).
    
    (3) On each occasion on which the tribunal issues a summons under [clause 9][301], the tribunal must fix an amount that, on the service of the summons, or at some other reasonable time before the date on which the witness is required to attend, is to be paid or tendered to the witness.
    
    (4) The amount fixed under subclause (3) is to be the estimated amount of the allowances and travelling expenses (but not fees) to which, in the opinion of the tribunal, the witness will be entitled, according to the prescribed scales, if the witness attends at the time and place specified in the summons.

##### 11 Power to take evidence on oath
    
*   (1) The tribunal may take evidence on oath, and for that purpose any member, or any other person acting under the express or implied direction of the tribunal, may administer an oath.
    
    (2) On any indictment for perjury it is sufficient to prove that the oath was administered in accordance with subclause (1).

##### 15 Discovery
    
*   (1) The tribunal may, in relation to discovery, make any order that a District Court may make under [section 56A][337] or [56B][338] of the District Courts Act 1947; and those sections apply accordingly with all necessary modifications.
    
    (2) Every application for an order under [section 56A][337] or [56B][338] of the District Courts Act 1947 (as applied by subclause (1)) is to be dealt with in accordance with regulations made under this Act.

*   (1) In any adjudication for the recovery of any money, the tribunal may, if it thinks fit and subject to subclause (2), order the inclusion, in the sum for which a determination is given, of interest, at such rate, not exceeding the 90-day bill rate plus 2%, as the tribunal thinks fit, on the whole or part of the money for the whole or part of the period between the date when the cause of action arose and the date of payment in accordance with the judgment.
    
    (2) Subclause (1) does not authorise the giving of interest upon interest.

##### 17 Power to proceed if any party fails to attend
    
*   If, without good cause shown, any party to a claim before the tribunal fails to attend or be represented, the tribunal may act as fully in the matter before it as if that party had duly attended or been represented.

##### 18 Proceedings not invalid for want of form
    
*   No decision or order of the tribunal, and no proceedings before the tribunal, are to be held bad for want of form, or be void or in any way vitiated by reason of any informality or error of form.

##### 19 Proceedings to continue on change of member acting as tribunal
    
*   If the member acting as the tribunal for the purpose of hearing a claim cannot continue to hear the claim and another member is appointed to continue with the claim, any proceedings then in progress do not abate and are not affected, but are to continue and are to be dealt with by the new member as if no change had taken place, but the new member may require evidence to be retaken where necessary.

##### 20 Urgency
    
*   If any party to any proceedings applies to the tribunal to accord urgency to the hearing of a claim, the tribunal must consider that application and may, if satisfied that it is necessary and just to do so, order that the proceedings be heard by the tribunal as soon as practicable.

##### 21 Proceedings not to abate because of death
    
*   If, in proceedings before the tribunal, a party to the claim concerned dies,---
        
    *   (a) the proceedings do not abate because of the death; but
    
    *   (b) the legal personal representative of the deceased party must be substituted for that party.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Weathertight Homes Resolution Services Act 2006\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 23 July 2011, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][344] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][345] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][346] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][347] and [17E][348] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
