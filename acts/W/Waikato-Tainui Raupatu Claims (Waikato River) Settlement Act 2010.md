*   #### Preamble
    
    ###### The Relationship of Waikato-Tainui with the Waikato River
    
    ###### ""Noo taatou te awa. Noo te awa taatou. E kore e taea te wehe te iwi o Waikato me te awa. He taonga tuku iho naa ngaa tuupuna. E whakapono ana maatou ko taa maatou, he tiaki i taua taonga moo ngaa uri whakatupu.""
    
    ###### Robert Te Kotahi Mahuta 1975
    
    ###### Te Mana o te Awa
    
    (1) To Waikato-Tainui, the Waikato River is a tupuna (ancestor) which has mana (prestige) and in turn represents the mana and mauri (life force) of the tribe. Respect for te mana o te awa (the spiritual authority, protective power and prestige of the Waikato River) is at the heart of the relationship between the tribe and their ancestral river:
    
    ###### Mana whakahaere
    
    (2) Mana whakahaere embodies the authority that Waikato-Tainui and other River tribes have established in respect of the Waikato River over many generations, to exercise control, access to and management of the Waikato River and its resources in accordance with tikanga (values, ethics and norms of conduct). For Waikato-Tainui, mana whakahaere has long been exercised under the mana of the Kiingitanga:
    
    ###### Raupatu and the River: Invasion and War, Confiscation of Waikato Lands
    
    (3) Waikato-Tainui, as at 1840, possessed their River, and their lands in accordance with their tikanga along with other Waikato River iwi. The Treaty of Waitangi guaranteed in the Maori text ""te tino rangatiratanga o o ratou wenua o ratou kainga me o ratou taonga katoa"" or in the English text ""the full exclusive and undisturbed possession of their Lands and Estates Forests Fisheries and other properties which they may collectively or individually possess so long as it is their wish and desire to retain the same in their possession"":
    
    (4) Waikato-Tainui made public statements of their authority over the Waikato River from the time they first became concerned that the Crown might itself claim authority over it. When the Governor's intentions to put an iron steamer on the River became known late in 1862, Patara Te Tuhi, editor of the Kiingitanga newspaper Te Hokioi, expressed the opposition of the chiefs warning that the gunboat might not enter the River without permission. He asserted tribal authority over the River in these words: ""E hara a Waikato awa i a te kuini, erangi no nga Maori anake"". (The Waikato River does not belong to the Queen of England, it belongs only to Maori.):
    
    (5) In July 1863, the Crown's military forces crossed the Mangataawhiri River. In the ensuing war of 1863-64, the Crown's forces attacked by both land and water. The Crown's armed steamers and barges played a crucial role in the invasion as they carried Crown forces and supplies up the Waikato River and into the Waipaa River, and shelled Waikato defences:
    
    (6) In December 1863, Crown forces occupied Ngaaruawaahia, the home of the King and the political centre of the Kiingitanga. During the war, many communities who supported the Kiingitanga were driven out of the Waikato. In 1864-65 military settlements, including Hamilton and Cambridge, were established on the Waikato River, and also on the Waipaa River:
    
    (7) Confiscation of Waikato lands followed in 1865\. The Waikato confiscation area extended from the Hauraki Gulf to Karapiro in the east, via Pukekura, Oraakau and the Puuniu River to the south, and from Whaingaroa (Raglan) to Te Puuaha o Waikato in the west:
    
    ###### Waikato-Tainui Experience of Raupatu
    
    (8) From the time of the Raupatu, the Crown assumed control of, and exercised jurisdiction over, the Waikato River. Waikato-Tainui were excluded from decision making: nor were they consulted as to their understanding of the River and its ecosystems. Waikato-Tainui rights and interests (whether at law, equity, custom or by the Treaty of Waitangi or otherwise), and the authority and control that they exercised to protect and ensure the well-being of the River and its resources, were denied:
    
    (9) Following the Raupatu and the cessation of hostilities, new settlers occupied the confiscated lands, and farms and towns were developed along the Waikato River. The River was used for farming, coal mining, power generation schemes, the discharge of waste, and domestic and industrial abstraction. The wetlands were drained, flood protection schemes were initiated and sand and shingle were removed. While all of these uses of the Waikato River contributed to the economic growth of New Zealand, they also contributed to the pollution and deterioration of the health of the Waikato River and have significantly impacted on the fisheries and plant life of the River:
    
    (10) Though they have continued to assert their mana whakahaere in order to protect the Waikato River and all its resources under the mana of the Kiingitanga, according to their tikanga, Waikato-Tainui believe that their ability to meet their obligations to the Waikato River, as their Awa Tupuna (Ancestral River), and to ensure its wellbeing, has been severely compromised. Waikato-Tainui feel this sense of injustice as strongly today as they did in the past:
    
    ###### Waikato-Tainui Commitment to the Search for Justice
    
    (11) In the changing legal and political landscape of New Zealand, Waikato-Tainui have always maintained the importance of their unique relationship with the River, and the need to respect and restore its wellbeing:
    
    (12) Robert Te Kotahi Mahuta, who led the Kiingitanga search for justice from the 1970s, appealed against the granting of water rights for the Huntly Power Station, at a time when little consideration was given to Waikato-Tainui values and rights. From 1985, a new commitment by the Crown to addressing historical grievances brought hope to Waikato-Tainui that their Raupatu claim, which affected both lands and the River, might be resolved. Waikato-Tainui negotiated their claim directly with the Crown and reached settlement in 1995, excluding and preserving their claims in respect of the Waikato River:
    
    (13) From the late 1980s, Waikato-Tainui also sought to protect the River, and their Raupatu claim, through negotiation with the Crown, and through the courts, from the impact of the Government's policy of privatisation of assets and corporatisation. In particular, Waikato-Tainui were concerned that their interests in the River would be depleted and that this would further alienate Waikato-Tainui from the River. The Crown agreed not to transfer water rights, issued in perpetuity, to any State enterprise. The new resource management regime included limits for the period for which water rights could be granted:
    
    (14) The Resource Management Act 1991 gave regional and local authorities substantial functions and powers over natural resources, including the power to grant resource consents for River use. The Act did not, however, provide for protection of te mana o te Awa and te mana whakahaere of Waikato-Tainui. Since the Act came into effect, Waikato-Tainui have been involved as respondents in many consent hearings, seeking conditions which would protect the River:
    
    (15) Negotiations with the Crown were commenced by Robert Te Kotahi Mahuta on behalf of Waikato-Tainui in 1999\. Following his death, they recommenced in 2005, leading to the deed of settlement and the Kiingitanga Accord between the Crown and Waikato-Tainui dated 22 August 2008:
    
    (16) From the 1860s to the present, Waikato-Tainui have continually sought justice for their Raupatu claim and protection for the River. The principles of te mana o te awa and mana whakahaere have long sustained the Waikato River claim together with the principles described in the Kiingitanga Accord, and those principles underlie the new regime to be implemented by this settlement:
    
    ###### Crown Acknowledgements
    
    (17) In summary, the Crown acknowledges:
        
    *   (a) that the historical Waikato River claims by Waikato-Tainui arise from the 1860s raupatu and its consequences; and
    
    *   (b) that the Crown's 1863 invasion by both land and the Waikato River was a double blow to Waikato-Tainui; and
    
    *   (c) that the Crown's breach of the Treaty of Waitangi denied Waikato-Tainui their rights and interests in, and mana whakahere over, the Waikato River; and
    
    *   (d) that Waikato-Tainui never willingly or knowingly relinquished their rights and interests in, or authority over, the Waikato River; and
    
    *   (e) the importance to Waikato-Tainui of the principle of te mana o te Awa; and
    
    *   (f) to Waikato-Tainui the Waikato River is a tupuna which has mana and in turn represents the mana and mauri of Waikato-Tainui; and
    
    *   (g) that to Waikato-Tainui, the Waikato River is a single indivisible being; and
    
    *   (h) that for Waikato-Tainui, their relationship with, and respect for, the Waikato River gives rise to their responsibilities to protect the mana and mauri of the River and exercise their mana whakahaere in accordance with their long established tikanga; and
    
    *   (i) that for Waikato-Tainui, their relationship with, and respect for, the Waikato River lies at the heart of their spiritual and physical wellbeing, and their tribal identity and culture; and
    
    *   (j) that the Crown has failed to respect, provide for and protect the special relationship of Waikato-Tainui with the Waikato River; and
    
    *   (k) that the deterioration of the health of the Waikato River, while under the authority of the Crown, has been a source of distress for the people of Waikato-Tainui; and
    
    *   (l) that the pollution, degradation and development of the Waikato River, its lakes, streams and wetlands have caused the decline of once rich fisheries that, for generations, had sustained the people's way of life and their ability to meet obligations of manaakitanga, and this is a further source of distress; and
    
    *   (m) that the Crown respects the deeply felt obligation of Waikato-Tainui to protect te mana o te awa; and
    
    *   (n) that the Crown seeks a settlement that will recognise and sustain the special relationship of Waikato-Tainui with the Waikato River; and
    
    *   (o) that the Crown undertakes to assist and work with Waikato-Tainui to restore their mana whakahaere; and
    
    *   (p) that Waikato-Tainui wish to promote the concept of a korowai to bring the River tribes together as an affirmation of their common purpose to protect te mana o te awa.

*   (1) The Crown recognises the statement of significance of the Waikato River to Waikato-Tainui as stated in this section.
    
    (2) He tuupuna noo ngaa iwi o Waikato-Tainui Te Awa o Waikato. E mau ana te mana te mauri me te kaha o te Iwi. He mauri tu tahi e kore e wehea. Ka rere mai oona wai i Te Taheke hukahuka puta atu ki te Puuaha o Waikato. Ka hono haere ai ngaa wai o Te Awa o Waikato i ngaa parenga, i ngaa whaiawa, i nga momo takawai o raro, i ngaa rerenga, i ngaa waikeri, i ngaa wehenga, i ngaa roto, i ngaa ika, i ngaa tupunga otaota, i ngaa maania, i ngaa repo, i ngaa motu, i ngaa puna, i ngaa arawai o te awa, i ngaa ararangi o te awa, i ngaa tuaapapa o te awa, tae noa ki oona tohu a wairua me toona mauri. Naa too maatou hononga ki te awa, naa too maatou manaaki i te awa te take ka tiaki i te mana o te awa, aa, ka riro maa maatou taua mana whakahaere i runga i ngaa tikanga tuku iho mo te awa. No reira, naa too maatou hononga ki te awa hei kaitiaki te puutake o too maatou oranga a wairua, oranga a tinana, a, tae noa ki oo maatou tikanga a iwi katoa.
    
    (3) The Waikato River is our tupuna (ancestor) which has mana (spiritual authority and power) and in turn represents the mana and mauri (life force) of Waikato-Tainui. The Waikato River is a single indivisible being that flows from Te Taheke Hukahuka to Te Puuaha o Waikato (the mouth) and includes its waters, banks and beds (and all minerals under them) and its streams, waterways, tributaries, lakes, aquatic fisheries, vegetation, flood plains, wetlands, islands, springs, water column, airspace, and substratum as well as its metaphysical being. Our relationship with the Waikato River, and our respect for it, gives rise to our responsibilities to protect te mana o te Awa and to exercise our mana whakahaere in accordance with long established tikanga to ensure the wellbeing of the river. Our relationship with the river and our respect for it lies at the heart of our spiritual and physical wellbeing, and our tribal identity and culture.

---

## Schedule 1  
Principles described in Kiingitanga Accord

[s 6][8]

##### 1 Te mana o te awa (the spiritual authority, protective power, and prestige of the river)
    
*   (1) To Waikato-Tainui, the Waikato River is a tupuna (ancestor) which has mana (prestige) and in turn represents the mana and mauri (life force) of the tribe. The River has its own mauri, its own spiritual energy and its own powerful identity. It is a single indivisible being.
    
    (2) Respect for te mana o te awa (the spiritual authority, protective power, and prestige of the Waikato River) is at the heart of the relationship between the tribe and their ancestral River. Waikato-Tainui regard their River with reverence and love. It gave them their name and is the source of their tribal identity. Over generations, Waikato-Tainui have developed tikanga (values, ethics, governing conduct) which embody their profound respect for the Waikato River and all life within it. The Waikato River sustains the people physically and spiritually. It brings them peace in times of stress, relief from illness and pain, and cleanses and purifies their bodies and souls from the many problems that surround them. Spiritually, to Waikato-Tainui, the Waikato River is constant, enduring and perpetual.

##### 2 Mana whakahaere (authority and rights of control)
    
*   (1) Mana whakahaere refers to the authority that Waikato-Tainui and other Waikato River iwi have established in respect of the Waikato River over many generations. Mana whakahaere entails the exercise of rights and responsibilities to ensure that the balance and mauri (life force) of the Waikato River are maintained. It is based in recognition that if we care for the River, the River will continue to sustain the people.
    
    (2) In customary terms mana whakahaere is the exercise of control, access to, and management of the Waikato River, including its resources in accordance with tikanga (values, ethics, governing conduct). For Waikato-Tainui, mana whakahaere has long been exercised under the mana of the Kiingitanga.

##### 3 Health and wellbeing
    
*   (1) The principle of health and wellbeing reflects the overarching purpose of the settlement, which is to restore and protect the health and wellbeing of the Waikato River.
    
    (2) The health and wellbeing of Waikato-Tainui and its special relationship with the Waikato River is inherently connected with the health and wellbeing of the Waikato River.

##### 4 Co-management
    
*   (1) The Crown and Waikato-Tainui have committed to enter into a new era of co-management in respect of the Waikato River. The principle of co-management includes---
        
    *   (a) the highest level of good faith engagement; and
    
    *   (b) consensus decision-making as a general rule;---
    
    while having regard to statutory frameworks and the mana whakahaere of Waikato-Tainui and other Waikato River iwi.
    
    (2) To be effective, co-management must---
        
    *   (a) be implemented and achieved at a number of levels and across a range of management agencies, bodies and authorities, including (but without limitation) the following:
            
        *   (i) the development, amendment and implementation of strategies, policy, legislation and regulations that may potentially impact on the health and wellbeing of the Waikato River; and
        
        *   (ii) the processes for granting, transfer, variation and renewal of consents, licences, permits and other authorisations for all activities that potentially impact on the health and wellbeing of the Waikato River; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) include provision for effective Waikato-Tainui input and participation by engagement at an early stage in statutory and management processes, and other actions, that may affect the health and wellbeing of the Waikato River, including the planning and development of new and amended policies or management initiatives or decisions affecting or relating to the Waikato River. This is a positive obligation to provide for early and effective input from Waikato-Tainui, rather than simply an obligation to consult.
    
    

##### 5 Integration
    
*   Arising from the principles of te mana o te Awa and mana whakahaere, and inter-related to the principle of co-management, is the principle of integration. The health and wellbeing of the Waikato River and successful co-management require effective integration of management between the relevant government agencies, Crown entities, local authorities and non-governmental agencies who have roles and responsibilities in respect of the Waikato River.

##### 6 Treaty of Waitangi
    
*   Te Tiriti o Waitangi/the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles apply to the Kiingitanga Accord and the relationship between the  Crown  and  Waikato-Tainui  reflected  in  the  Kiingitanga Accord.

##### 7 Honour and integrity
    
*   Underpinning the settlement is the principle of honour and integrity. Waikato-Tainui and the Crown have entered into the settlement in good faith relying on the commitments of each other contained in the 2008 deed and the Kiingitanga Accord with the intention of achieving a full, fair and durable settlement of the raupatu claims of Waikato-Tainui in relation to the Waikato River.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Waikato-Tainui Raupatu Claims (Waikato River) Settlement Act 2010\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 13 June 2013, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][268] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][269] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][270] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][271] and [17E][272] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
