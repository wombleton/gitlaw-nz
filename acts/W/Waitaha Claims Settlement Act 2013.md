*   #### Preamble
    
    (1) Recitals (2) to (12) of this Preamble present, in summary form, the historical account set out in the deed of settlement entered into by Waitaha and the Crown:
    
    (2) Waitaha are an ancient iwi who descend from Hei and his son Waitaha who arrived on the waka Te Arawa. Their area of interest extends from Waimapu to Mauao along the coastline to Maketu, and inland to Ōtanewainuku. By the 1840s, Waitaha primarily occupied the land between Tauranga harbour and Te Puke. During the 1840s and 1850s, the Waitaha leader and prophet, Hakaraia, preached peaceful engagement with Pākehā:
    
    (3) When Crown forces invaded the Waikato in July 1863 a number of Waitaha fought for the Kīngitanga, while some sided with the Crown. Others remained neutral. These internal divisions created enmity amongst Waitaha and also with neighbouring iwi: 
    
    (4) War came to Tauranga in 1864\. Hakaraia was a spiritual leader for the Māori force which defeated Crown troops at Gate Pā in April. When Crown troops defeated Kīngitanga Māori at Te Ranga in June, Waitaha men were among the casualties:
    
    (5) The Crown regarded those Māori who fought at Gate Pā and Te Ranga as rebels. In May 1865, the Crown confiscated 214000 acres of land around Tauranga including land in which Waitaha had customary interests. The Crown announced that it would retain only a quarter of the confiscated land and that the remainder would be returned to Māori:
    
    (6) Hakaraia rose to prominence as a leader of the resistance to the survey of confiscated land to be retained by the Crown. In January 1867, using scorched earth tactics, government forces assaulted Waitaha settlements near Te Puke, destroying houses, crops, and livestock as ""a special punishment"" for Hakaraia. The Crown pursued Hakaraia and ultimately took his life in 1870:
    
    (7) In 1868, the Crown extended the boundary of the confiscation district by 75 000 acres to include much land claimed by Waitaha and also Ōtawa, a maunga sacred to Waitaha. The Crown accepted the ancestral claims of Waitaha to approximately 25000 acres in the confiscation district but decided to retain much of this ""in payment for the sin"" of Hakaraia:
    
    (8) The Crown opened negotiations with Waitaha for land at Te Puke in 1873 before the Native Land Court had determined the land's ownership. The court, which was created under the native land laws introduced by the Crown in the 1860s, was established to convert customary title, which was communal and fluid, into individualised and permanent titles derived from the Crown:
    
    (9) Waitaha did not initially wish to sell or lease its land at Te Puke. However, in September 1873, rival claims over the land motivated Waitaha to sell part of the block. The Crown pressured Waitaha into selling more land and told Waitaha the block would be mortgaged to the government if they did not sell, on account of a survey debt owed by another claimant to Te Puke:
    
    (10) Waitaha were by this time suffering great economic hardship and wanted the Crown to pay the balance of the purchase money without waiting for the court to determine title. When the Crown refused, Waitaha tried to withdraw from the sale in order to sell to a private party. The Crown would not relinquish its purchase and barred private parties from attempting to acquire the land. The Native Land Court eventually awarded title to Te Puke to Waitaha in October 1878\. The Crown completed its purchase over the next 8 years:
    
    (11) Waitaha took part in many Native Land Court hearings in the 1880s and early 1890s. Most of the land Waitaha were awarded was sold in the 1880s and 1890s, largely to the Crown:
    
    (12) By the end of the 19th century Waitaha were virtually landless and had insufficient resources to sustain themselves. According to Waitaha, this forced some members of the iwi to follow other tribal affiliations. Waitaha express this impact in the whakataukī, ""Kō Waitaha te iwi, he tangata ngākaurua"": Waitaha were once a powerful tribe, but because of the loss of land they became fragmented and have never been able to unite again:

The Parliament of New Zealand therefore enacts as follows:

##### 6 Acknowledgements by the Crown
    
*   The text of the acknowledgements made by the Crown, as set out in the deed of settlement, is as follows:
    
    (1) The Crown acknowledges that Waitaha, an ancient iwi descending from Hei and Waitaha of the waka Te Arawa, has long sought acknowledgement and redress for its grievances. The Crown has failed to deal with these grievances in an appropriate way. The Crown hereby recognises the legitimacy of the historical grievances of Waitaha and makes the following acknowledgements.
    
    (2) The Crown acknowledges that the coming of war to the Bay of Plenty in the 1860s split Waitaha internally. Individuals and hapū were compelled to align themselves with different sides in the conflict and this caused discord and enmity within the iwi, and in the relationships Waitaha had with other iwi and with the Crown.
    
    (3) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) the Waitaha rangatira Hakaraia Mahika initially promoted peaceful engagement with Pākehā; and
    
    *   (b) in his support for the Kīngitanga, Hakaraia sought to halt the sale of Māori land, and that he escalated his opposition only after Crown forces invaded the Waikato.
    
    (4) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) Waitaha warriors, including Hakaraia, took part in the battles at Pukehinahina and Te Ranga in April and June 1864; and
    
    *   (b) members of Waitaha were killed by Crown troops at Te Ranga; and
    
    *   (c) the Crown was ultimately responsible for the outbreak of war in Tauranga and the resulting loss of life, and that its actions were a breach of Te Tiriti o Waitangi/the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles.
    
    (5) The Crown acknowledges that, taken together, the Tauranga confiscation/raupatu and the subsequent Tauranga District Lands Acts 1867 and 1868---
        
    *   (a) affected all Waitaha, including those who had not opposed the Crown; and
    
    *   (b) included Ōtawa, a maunga sacred to all the descendants of Hei and Waitaha; and
    
    *   (c) compulsorily extinguished customary title in the land within the extended confiscation/raupatu district.
    
    (6) The Crown further acknowledges that it---
        
    *   (a) returned land to Waitaha in the form of individualised title rather than Māori customary title; and
    
    *   (b) wrongfully retained land in order to punish Waitaha for the actions of Hakaraia, whom it deemed to be a rebel.
    
    (7) The Crown acknowledges that the confiscation/raupatu and the subsequent Tauranga District Lands Acts 1867 and 1868---
        
    *   (a) had a detrimental effect on the welfare and economy of Waitaha and deprived the iwi of wāhi tapu, access to natural resources and opportunities for development; and
    
    *   (b) prevented Waitaha from exercising mana and rangatiratanga over land and resources within the Tauranga confiscation district.
    
    (8) The Crown acknowledges that in its effects on Waitaha, the confiscation/raupatu and the subsequent Tauranga District Lands Acts 1867 and 1868 were unjust, indiscriminate, and a breach of Te Tiriti o Waitangi/the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles.
    
    (9) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) it inflicted a scorched earth policy in its assaults on Waitaha settlements during the bush campaign; and
    
    *   (b) the resulting destruction further devastated the welfare and economy of Waitaha; and
    
    *   (c) Waitaha were forced to flee their settlements and were unable to return for many years.
    
    (10) The Crown acknowledges that the treatment that Waitaha received from the Crown during the bush campaign was unreasonable, inflicted considerable unnecessary harm on Waitaha, and was a breach of Te Tiriti o Waitangi/the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles.
    
    (11) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) it did not consult with Waitaha on the Native Land Acts of 1862 and 1865; and
    
    *   (b) the workings of the native land laws, in particular in the awarding of land to individuals rather than iwi or hapū and the enabling of individuals to deal with that land without reference to the iwi or hapū, made the lands of Waitaha more susceptible to alienation. As a result, the traditional social structures, mana and rangatiratanga of Waitaha were eroded. The Crown acknowledges it failed to take adequate steps to protect these structures, and this was a breach of Te Tiriti o Waitangi/the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles.
    
    (12) The Crown acknowledges that it exploited inter-iwi competition over Te Puke block and used outstanding survey charges and the threat of mortgage to pressure Waitaha into selling the land. The Crown used the Native Lands Act 1877 to prevent Waitaha from selling the land to private parties. The combined effect of these aggressive purchase techniques meant that the Crown failed actively to protect the interests of Waitaha in the land they wished to retain and this was a breach of Te Tiriti o Waitangi/the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles.
    
    (13) The Crown acknowledges further land was lost to Waitaha during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries through purchases by private parties of land originally intended to be inalienable, additional Crown purchases and public works takings. These losses came at a time when Waitaha were already experiencing great economic hardship.
    
    (14) The Crown acknowledges that the cumulative effect of its actions has rendered Waitaha virtually landless. By 1900, members of the iwi held only a fraction---approximately 2.5 per cent---of their former rohe. While the land and resources alienated from Waitaha have benefited the nation as a whole, the reserves created for Waitaha from Te Puke block, including ""Manoeka"", were insufficient to support or sustain the iwi's members. This forced some Waitaha to follow their other tribal affiliations, weakening the identity of Waitaha as an iwi. The Crown's failure to ensure that Waitaha were left with sufficient land for their present and future needs was a breach of Te Tiriti o Waitangi/the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles.
    
    (15) The Crown acknowledges that the cumulative effect of its breaches of Te Tiriti o Waitangi/the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles undermined the physical, cultural, social, economic and spiritual well-being of Waitaha to the point where the iwi itself nearly vanished. The suffering and marginalisation caused to Waitaha over the generations have continued to the present day.

##### 7 Apology by the Crown to Waitaha
    
*   The text of the apology offered by the Crown to Waitaha, as set out in the deed of settlement, is as follows:
    
    (1) The Crown makes the following apology to the descendants of Hei and Waitaha known as Waitaha.
    
    (2) The Crown is deeply sorry that it has failed to fulfil its obligations to Waitaha under Te Tiriti o Waitangi/the Treaty of Waitangi.
    
    (3) The Crown's acts and omissions have severed you from almost all of your traditional lands and driven your ancient iwi to the point where it nearly ceased to exist. For these acts and omissions, and for the suffering they caused and continue to cause, the Crown apologises.
    
    (4) The Tauranga confiscation/raupatu was unjust and Hakaraia Mahika opposed it. For this, the Crown labelled him a rebel. In seeking to punish him, the Crown destroyed your houses, crops and livestock, and ultimately took his life. The Crown inflicted further punishment even after his death by unfairly withholding a large amount of land from you. For these misdeeds the Crown apologises to Waitaha and to Hakaraia.
    
    (5) The stigma of rebellion has diminished the mana of Waitaha and forced deep divisions among you, and between you and your neighbours. The Crown recognises that this burden has pressed most heavily on the descendants of Hakaraia, but has affected all of Waitaha. The Crown regrets that you have been forced to bear this stigma, and wishes the mana and reputation of Hakaraia and Waitaha to be restored. Accordingly, the Crown apologises for the part it played in placing this burden upon you.
    
    (6) The Crown wishes to restore its own tarnished honour too and hopes that this apology will mark the beginning of a stronger relationship with Waitaha, a relationship based on trust, co-operation, and respect for Te Tiriti o Waitangi/the Treaty of Waitangi. Accordingly, the Crown echoes the following Waitaha whakatauki:
    
    Kua tau te rangimārie
    
    Ki te whare o Hakaraia
    
    Āke, āke, āke.
    
    The peace has been settled 
    
    In the house of Hakaraia
    
    Now and forever more.
