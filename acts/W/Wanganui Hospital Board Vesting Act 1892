An Act to vest in the Wanganui Hospital Board the Land and Buildings used for the Purposes of the Wanganui Hospital, together with the Fixtures and Improvements thereon, and to make Provision for the Sale or Leasing thereof.
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    WHEREAS the lands described in the Schedule hereto were, by a certain grant from the Crown dated the eleventh day of May, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-two, granted unto the Superintendent of the Province of Wellington and his successors, Superintendents of the said province, in trust for the site of a public hospital: And whereas the said lands have become vested in Her Majesty the Queen under the provisions of The Abolition of Provinces Act 1875: And whereas the said lands, buildings, fixtures, and improvements thereon have, since the said Board was constituted, been used and occupied by the said Board for the purposes of a hospital, but the said Board has not acquired any title thereto: And whereas it is expedient that the said land, buildings, fixtures, and improvements should be vested in the said Board: And whereas the said lands are no longer a convenient site for a hospital, and the said Board has purchased, with moneys forming part of the Hospital Fund of the said Board, certain other lands in the neighbourhood of Wanganui, on which said other lands the said Board intends to erect another and more commodious hospital in lieu of the hospital now existing on the lands described in the Schedule hereto: And whereas it is expedient to confer upon the said Board the powers hereinafter contained over the lands described in the Schedule hereto:

BE IT THEREFORE ENACTED by the General Assembly of New Zealand in Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:---

##### 1 Short Title
    
*   The Short Title of this Act is The Wanganui Hospital Board Vesting Act 1892\.

##### 2 Wanganui Hospital land and buildings transferred to Hospital Board
    
*   The lands described in the Schedule hereto, together with the buildings, fixtures, and improvements thereon, are hereby vested in the Wanganui Hospital Board for an estate in fee-simple for the purposes of a general hospital at Wanganui, subject to the provisions of The Hospitals and Charitable Institutions Act 1885, and the said lands shall be deemed to be an endowment vested in the said Board within the meaning of section 32 of the said Act.

##### 3 Power to Board to construct new hospital
    
*   On delivery to him of a copy of this Act the District Land Registrar at Wellington shall, without any further conveyance or transfer, issue to the Wanganui Hospital Board a certificate of title under The Land Transfer Act 1885, for the lands described in the Schedule hereto, notwithstanding that the original Crown grant for the same dated the eleventh day of May, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-two, be not produced or forthcoming.

##### 4 Power to sell present site and apply proceeds for new hospital
    
*   It shall be lawful for the said Board, as soon as it shall have built and completed on the site recently purchased for such purpose as aforesaid, or on some other suitable site, a new hospital to the satisfaction of the Inspector of Institutions for the time being under The Hospitals and Charitable Institutions Act 1885, from time to time and at any time to sell, either by public auction or by public tender, as it may think fit, all or any part of the said lands, buildings, fixtures, and improvements either together or in lots, on such conditions and subject to such terms as the Board may consider proper; but all moneys received from such sale or sales shall be expended, at the discretion of the said Board, either in repayment of such moneys as have been expended in building such new hospital as aforesaid or in or towards improving such new hospital or the accommodation thereof in such manner as the said Board may think fit. A certificate signed by such Inspector of Institutions as aforesaid that a new hospital has been built and completed to his satisfaction shall be conclusive evidence thereof, and the production of such certificate to the District Land Registrar at Wellington shall be sufficient authority for such District Land Registrar to register any dealings with the lands described in the Schedule hereto authorised by this Act or by The Hospitals and Charitable Institutions Act 1885\.

##### 5 Power of leasing if not required to sell
    
*   The said Board, after such new hospital has been erected and completed as aforesaid, may, at its discretion, instead of selling, let from time to time all or any part of the lands described in the Schedule hereto, or may sell part and let part thereof, such letting to be in manner provided and with, under, and subject to the terms and conditions mentioned in sections 84, 85, and 86 of The Hospitals and Charitable Institutions Act 1885; and all rents and profits accruing therefrom shall form part of the Wanganui Hospital Fund.
