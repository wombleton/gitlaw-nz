An Act to vest in a New Board to be incorporated under Part 2 of the Religious, Charitable, and Educational Trusts Act 1908, certain Real and Personal Property at present vested in the St Peter's Taranaki Street Mission Trust Board (also incorporated under the said Part of the said Act), and certain other property, and to declare Trusts concerning the same.
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    WHEREAS by a certain declaration of trust executed on the eleventh day of June, nineteen hundred and eight, by the Reverend George Paul Davys, of the City of Wellington, vicar of St Peter's Parish, in the City of Wellington (a parish existing under the Constitution and Canons of the Church of the Province of New Zealand, commonly called the Church of England, and under the Acts of the Synod of the Diocese of Wellington, also existing under the said Constitution and Canons), and Thomas Ballinger, of the City of Wellington, merchant, trusts were declared concerning certain land which as it then existed was described in the said declaration of trust and is described in Schedule [1][16] to this Act: And whereas such trusts included (_inter alia_) the use of the said land and the building thereon for the purpose of holding in such building Divine service according to the tenets, rites, and ceremonies of the said Church and as part of the work of the said St Peter's Parish, or of any parish within which the whole or the greater part of a certain area then and now in the said parish might thereafter be included, or of any parish or parochial district which might thereafter be constituted in connection with the said Church and in which the whole or the greater part of the said area should be included, such Divine service to be conducted by or under the supervision and control of the vicar of the said St Peter's Parish or of any such other parish or parochial district as aforesaid, and also (subject to provision being made for the holding of Divine service as aforesaid within the said area) the use, with the approval of such vicar as aforesaid for the time being, of all unleased land and buildings for meetings of Church attendants and others, and classes, and for any other purpose in connection with the work of the said Church approved of by such vicar for the time being: And whereas the said declaration of trust contained certain provisions requiring the consent or approval of the vicar of the said parish or of the vestry of the said parish to the exercise of certain powers thereby conferred: And whereas on the twenty-second day of May, nineteen hundred and eighteen, the then trustees under the said declaration of trust became incorporated under the Religious, Charitable, and Educational Trusts Act 1908, under the title of ""The St Peter's Taranaki Street Mission Trust Board"": And whereas the land described in Schedule [1][16] to this Act became the centre of a work of the said Church known as the St Peter's Mission, and such work became greatly extended and large sums of money were raised for it: And whereas such sums of money have been employed in part in discharging the mortgage formerly charged upon the land described in the said Schedule [1][16], and in the acquisition of the real property described in Schedule [2][17] hereto: And whereas on the first day of August, nineteen hundred and twenty-two, the said St Peter's Taranaki Street Mission Trust Board executed a declaration of the trusts upon which the said real property described in the said Schedule [2][17], and any moneys and other property which were in or might from time to time come into its hands from any sources in connection with the said St Peter's Mission otherwise than under the provisions of the first-mentioned declaration of trust were or would be held by it: And whereas the last-mentioned declaration of trust contained certain provisions requiring in certain events the approval of the vicar or other clergyman for the time being having the charge of the parish or parochial or other ecclesiastical district in which the headquarters of the said Mission should for the time being be situate: And whereas the work carried on in connection with the said Mission has greatly extended, and it is desirable that the same should be carried on in future as a diocesan work not associated with any particular parish, and that the property described in the said Schedules [1][16] and [2][17] should be vested in a new Board to be incorporated under the said Act, and that new trusts should be declared concerning the said property and any moneys or property which may in future be raised or acquired for the purposes of the said Mission:

BE IT THEREFORE ENACTED by the General Assembly of New Zealand in Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:---
