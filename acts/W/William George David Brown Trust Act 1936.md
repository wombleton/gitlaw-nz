BE IT THEREFORE ENACTED by the General Assembly of New Zealand in Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:---

##### 1 Short Title
    
*   This Act may be cited as the William George David Brown Trust Act 1936\.

##### 2 Constitution and incorporation of Board
    
*   (1) The Board of Trustees referred to in paragraph four of the will, in lieu of being constituted as provided in paragraph five of the will, shall consist of---
        
    *   (a) The person from time to time holding the office of Mayor of the City of Wellington:
    
    *   (b) The person from time to time holding the office of Chairman of the Wellington Hospital Board:
    
    *   (c) The person from time to time holding the office of trustee of the will.
    
    (2) The said Board of Trustees is hereby constituted a body corporate under the name of ""The Board of Trustees of the WGD Brown Trust"" (hereinafter referred to as the Board) with perpetual succession and a common seal.

##### 3 Provision in event of vacancy, absence, or incapacity
    
*   (1) If at any time the office of Mayor of the City of Wellington or the office of Chairman of the Wellington Hospital Board is vacant, or the said Mayor or the said Chairman is absent from the Dominion of New Zealand or unable to act in his office, then and in such case during such vacancy, absence, or incapacity the person for the time being acting as such Mayor or Chairman shall be entitled to act as and to exercise all the powers of a member of the Board in the room and stead of the Mayor or the Chairman, as the case may be.
    
    (2) A resolution passed at any meeting of the Board declaring that any person is for the time being entitled to act in the room and stead of such Mayor or Chairman shall be conclusive evidence in all Courts that such person is so entitled to act.

##### 4 Representation on Board of corporate trustee
    
*   (1) If at any time a corporation is trustee of the will, such corporation may from time to time by resolution of its directors or other governing body authorize such person as it thinks fit to act as its representative at meetings of the Board. Any such appointment may in like manner be revoked.
    
    (2) A person authorized as aforesaid shall be entitled to exercise the same powers on behalf of the corporation as the corporation could exercise if it were an individual member of the Board.

##### 5 Provision in event of member of Board declining to act, or resigning
    
*   If any person (including any person appointed under the provisions of this section) entitled to act as a member of the Board shall decline so to act or shall resign from membership of the Board, or if any person appointed under the provisions of this section shall die, or be absent from the Dominion of New Zealand, or be unable to act as a member of the Board, the other member or members of the Board may appoint some other person to act as a member of the Board in place of the person so declining to act, or resigning, or dying, or being absent from New Zealand, or being unable to act. Any person so appointed shall hold office as a member of the Board for the period during which the person in whose place he is appointed would have been entitled to act as a member of the Board had he not so declined to act, or resigned, or died, or been absent from New Zealand, or been unable to act.

##### 6 Validity of acts of Board notwithstanding vacancies or defective appointments
    
*   The Board may act notwithstanding any vacancy in its membership, and the validity of any act of the Board shall not be affected or called in question by reason of any defect or informality in the appointment of a member of the Board to an office which qualifies him for a seat on the Board.

##### 7 Powers of Board
    
*   The Board shall have and may exercise all and singular the powers and authorities given to or exercisable by the Board of Trustees by or under the will:
    
    Provided that in the event of the Board exercising the power conferred on it by subparagraph (d) of paragraph five of the will, the salary or remuneration therein referred to shall be paid by the trustee of the will out of the income available for distribution under paragraph four of the will.

##### 8 Resolutions of Board final
    
*   Any resolution of the Board directing or appointing that any of the income available for distribution under paragraph four of the will shall be paid or applied to any charitable or educational purpose or institution which is _bona fide_ believed by the Board to be eligible to participate under paragraph four of the will shall be final and conclusive evidence that such charitable or educational purpose or institution is so eligible to participate.

##### 9 Costs of Act to be taxed
    
*   All costs, charges, and expenses of and incidental to the preparing, settling, obtaining, and passing of this Act shall, after such costs, charges, and expenses shall have been taxed and allowed as between solicitor and client by the Registrar at Wellington of the High Court, be paid out of the residuary estate of the testator.
    
    The words ""High Court"" were substituted, as from 1 April 1980, for the words the ""Supreme Court"" pursuant to section [12][12] Judicature Amendment Act 1979 (1979 No 124).
