*   (1) Subject to subsection [(2)][4] of this section, for the more effectual carrying out of the said trusts, the Minister of Conservation may enter into an agreement with the Crown Forestry Management Limited or, after consultation with the Waitangi National Trust Board, with any other person or body, for the Crown Forestry Management Limited, or that person or body, to manage, on behalf of the Crown, afforestation and silvicultural operations upon the said lands, subject to the requirements of the trust described in section [2][3] of this Act.
    
    (2) It shall not be incumbent upon the Minister of Conservation so to administer the management of the said lands as would be necessary if the sole purpose of the said trust were the management of the said lands as a source of revenue; but regard shall be had to the obligation imposed by section [2][3] of this Act by maintaining the said lands as a scenic background for the lands of the Waitangi National Trust.
    
    Section 3 was substituted, as from 1 April 1987, by section [65(1)][13] Conservation Act 1987 (1987 No 65).

    Provided further that any money received or paid on the exercise of any such powers shall be credited to or disbursed from the revenue of the said lands:
    
    Provided also that nothing herein contained shall be deemed to confer on the said lands the status of national endowment land under the last-named Act.

##### 8 Powers to subject other lands to this Act
    
*   The Governor-General may from time to time, by Order in Council, direct that any lands which are vested in the Crown or of which the Crown may enjoy the right of disposal and which adjoin or are adjacent to the lands described in the Schedule hereto shall be subject to this Act, and thereupon the provisions of this Act shall apply to such lands in all respects as if they were part of the lands described in the said Schedule.

##### 9 Control of dogs
