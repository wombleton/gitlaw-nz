*   #### Preamble
    
    Whereas by a certain deed of conveyance bearing date 20 June 1883 in pursuance of the [Special Powers and Contract Act 1882][23] His Excellency Sir William Francis Drummond Jervois (Governor of the Colony of New Zealand) (hereinafter called the **Governor**) conveyed and assured unto William Hogg Watt, of Wanganui in New Zealand, merchant, Henry Nathan, of the same place, farmer, Benjamin Nicholas Manley, also of the same place, accountant, and George McCaul, also of the same place, law clerk (hereinafter called the **original trustees**) the land described in [Schedule 1][21] upon trust _inter alia_ from time to time and at all times thereafter to permit the said piece or parcel of land and appurtenances and any hall or other buildings which may for the time being be standing thereon or any part thereof respectively to be used by all Lodges of the Ancient Fraternity of Free and Accepted Masons holding charter under any 1 or more of the Grand Lodges of England, Scotland, or Ireland now or hereafter to be established in the Town or Borough of Wanganui aforesaid and upon such terms and conditions as the trustees or trustee shall in their discretion think expedient: 
    
    And whereas the land now the subject of the trust of the said deed of conveyance is described in [Schedule 2][22]:
    
    And whereas by virtue of an order of the Supreme Court of New Zealand made on 28 February 1899 and by virtue of certain deeds of appointment bearing date 21 August 1916 and 23 November 1951 the said land is now vested in Alexander Stewart Ballingall, of Wanganui, public accountant, Peter Lockhart Dickson, of the same place, solicitor, Claud William Horne, of the same place, company manager, Forbes Clingan Wight, of the same place, master builder, Walter Max Willis, of the same place, solicitor, and Roy Stuart Withers, of the same place, solicitor (hereinafter called the **present trustees**):
    
    And whereas at the date of the said deed of conveyance the only Lodges then existing in Wanganui were Tongariro Lodge number 705 holding charter under the United Grand Lodge of England and the Saint Andrew Kilwinning Lodge holding charter under the Grand Lodge of Scotland: 
    
    And whereas in or about the year 1890 the Grand Lodge of New Zealand was constituted: 
    
    And whereas the Saint Andrew Kilwinning Lodge now holds charter as number 79 under the said Grand Lodge of New Zealand: 
    
    And whereas on or about 15 November 1920 Lodge Whanganui number 219 was constituted holding charter under the Grand Lodge of New Zealand: 
    
    And whereas the said 3 Lodges are the only Lodges now using the hall built on the land described in [Schedule 2][22]:
    
    And whereas it is desirable that the terms of the trust created by the said deed of conveyance be varied to include Lodges holding charter under the Grand Lodge of New Zealand and that the land hitherto vested in or controlled by the trustees for the time being under the said deed of conveyance be vested in a Trust Board to be a body corporate and to be called Wanganui Masonic Hall Trust Board.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Wanganui Masonic Hall Trust Board Act 1965\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 June 2002, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][26] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][27] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][28] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][29] and [17E][30] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
