    WHEREAS a company was, on the twenty-third day of August, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-one, formed and registered at Wellington, under the provisions of The Joint-stock Companies Act 1880, and re-registered on the fifth day of March, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-three, under the provisions of The Companies Act 1882, for the purpose (amongst other things) of constructing and maintaining a line of railway from the City of Wellington to the northern side of the Manawatu River: And whereas the nominal capital of the said company was by the memorandum of association thereof declared to be the sum of one million dollars, divided into one hundred thousand shares of ten dollars each: And whereas the whole of the said shares were duly issued, and calls thereon to the amount of one dollar eighty cents or thereabouts have been made and paid, and the sum of eight hundred thousand dollars has been raised by debentures duly issued by the company pursuant to the provisions of the articles of association thereof: And whereas it was found that the capital so provided was insufficient for the purposes of the company, and on the twenty-first day of April, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-five, a resolution was passed under the provisions of section number twenty-three of the articles of association of the company, and in pursuance of section twelve of The Companies Act 1882, authorizing the directors of the company to increase its capital by the creation and sale of one hundred thousand additional shares of ten dollars each: And whereas such resolution was a single resolution passed unanimously at a general meeting of the company duly convened and held, and notice of the intention to move such resolution had previously to the holding of the said meeting been given to the shareholders of the company: And whereas pursuant to the powers given to them by the said resolution, the directors of the company have duly issued forty thousand new shares of ten dollars each, upon which calls of one dollar forty cents or thereabouts have been made and paid, and have raised the sum of three hundred and twenty thousand dollars by debentures duly issued in respect of the said additional capital: And whereas it is expedient to validate the issue of the said additional shares and the raising of the said sum of three hundred and twenty thousand dollars as aforesaid:
    
    The references to ""one million dollars"", ""ten dollars"", ""one dollar eighty cents"", ""eight hundred thousand dollars"", ""one hundred and twenty thousand dollars"", ""one dollar forty ents"", ""three hundred and twenty thousand dollars"" were substituted, as from 10 July 1967, for references to ""five hundred thousand pounds"", ""five pounds"", ""four hundred thousand pounds"", ""sixty thousand pounds"", and ""one hundred and sixty thousand pounds"" pursuant to section [7(1)][5] of the Decimal Currency Act 1964 (1964 No 27).
