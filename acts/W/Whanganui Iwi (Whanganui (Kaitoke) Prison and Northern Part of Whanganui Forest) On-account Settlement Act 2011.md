*   #### Preamble
    
    (1) The Treaty of Waitangi was signed in 1840\. The terms of the Treaty of Waitangi in English and Māori are set out in [Schedule 1][16] of the Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975:
    
    (2) Recitals (3) and (4) of this Preamble present, in summary form, the background to the Deed of On-account Settlement of Historical Claims of Whanganui Iwi in relation to the Whanganui Kaitoke Prison and Part of the Whanganui Forest (the **deed of on-account settlement**) entered into by Whanganui Iwi and the Crown:
    
    (3) The agreement between the Crown and the Southern Whanganui Cluster/Tupoho working party (the **working party**) to enter into an on-account settlement was an outcome of discussions between Ngāti Apa (North Island) and the working party about aspects of the Ngāti Apa (North Island) settlement package as contained in the agreement in principle between Ngāti Apa (North Island) and the Crown (the **agreement in principle**):
    
    (4) After Ngāti Apa (North Island) had consulted with neighbouring iwi on the agreement in principle, the Crown and the working party signed the deed of on-account settlement on 31 July 2009\. Whanganui Iwi and the Crown agree that the value of the transfer of the assets under the deed of on-account settlement will be taken into account when the Crown makes an offer of redress for the final settlement of the Whanganui Iwi historical claims:

The Parliament of New Zealand therefore enacts as follows:
