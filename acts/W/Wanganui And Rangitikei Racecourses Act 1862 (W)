If there be more candidates proposed than the number to be elected, the Chairman, or some person appointed by him, shall call for a show of hands separately in favour of each candidate, and after such show of hands, shall declare the person or persons on whom the election has fallen.

And the mode of voting shall in all other respects be conducted in the same manner as is provided for the election of the members for the Provincial Council; and the Chairman shall report in writing to the Superintendent, the names of the persons elected to form the Trustees, and the same shall be published in the Government _Gazette_ of the Province. If any Trustee shall refuse to act, or be absent from the Province 4 months at any one time, or become bankrupt, or an insolvent debtor, within the meaning of any laws relating to insolvent debtors, or a public defaulter, or be convicted of felony, or any infamous crime, he shall cease to be a Trustee. If at any time a vacancy shall occur by reason of death, absence, resignation, bankruptcy, or otherwise, the Trustees shall signify the same to the Superintendent, who shall appoint a fresh election to take place, at such time and place as he shall think expedient; and such new Trustee shall hold office until the next General Election. All questions and disputes which may arise concerning the election of any Trustees shall be referred to the Superintendent and Executive Council, by petition in writing of 5 or more Electors, presented within 14 days after such election or such meeting at which the disputed proceeding shall have taken place; and all questions respecting the vacancy, of the office of members shall be referred to the Superintendent and Executive Council, whose decision shall be final:
    
    Provided always that if at any time the electors shall fail to appoint Trustees, whether at a general or special election, it shall be lawful for the Superintendent to appoint 5 Trustees, or such number as may be required to be elected, who shall have the same powers and be subject to the same regulations as if elected as herein provided. The Trustees shall continue in office until the next election of Trustees. The Trustees shall elect one of their number to be Chairman, who shall have a substantive and casting vote.
