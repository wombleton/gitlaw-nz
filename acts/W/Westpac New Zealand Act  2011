*   #### Preamble
    
    (1) Westpac Banking Corporation is incorporated in New South Wales, Australia under the Corporations Act 2001 of the Commonwealth of Australia, is registered in New Zealand as an overseas company under the [Companies Act 1993][31], and is a registered bank under the [Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1989][32]. Westpac Banking Corporation carries on a banking business in Australia, New Zealand, and certain other countries:
    
    (2) Since July 2003, the policy of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand has been that systemically important banks should be incorporated in New Zealand. Accordingly, Westpac Banking Corporation established Westpac New Zealand to assume and carry on Westpac Banking Corporation's New Zealand retail banking business. Westpac New Zealand is incorporated in New Zealand under the [Companies Act 1993][31] and is a registered bank under the [Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1989][32]:
    
    (3) Under the [Westpac New Zealand Act 2006][33] and the [Westpac New Zealand Proposal Approval Order 2006][34], Westpac Banking Corporation's New Zealand retail banking business was vested in Westpac New Zealand:
    
    (4) Having regard to the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's local incorporation policy, certain additional assets and liabilities of Westpac Banking Corporation, being principally assets and liabilities of Westpac Banking Corporation's New Zealand institutional banking business, are now to be vested in Westpac New Zealand:
    
    (5) Legislation is the only means by which these assets and liabilities of Westpac Banking Corporation can be vested in Westpac New Zealand efficiently and economically. Legislation is also the only means by which amendments to the [Westpac New Zealand Act 2006][33] can be effected:
    
    (6) The objects of this Act cannot be attained other than by legislation:

The Parliament of New Zealand therefore enacts as follows:

*   The purpose of [sections 22][24] and [23][25] is to ensure that the vesting of the designated assets and liabilities in Westpac New Zealand under this Act does not give rise to tax consequences under the Inland Revenue Acts for Westpac Banking Corporation or Westpac New Zealand that would not have arisen if they were the same person.
