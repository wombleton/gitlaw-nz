An Act to authorize the Reclamation of Land in the Harbour of Port Nicholson.
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    WHEREAS by a grant from the Crown dated the twenty-fourth day of June, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-four, a piece of land described in the Schedule to this Act was granted to the Mayor, Councillors, and Citizens of the City of Wellington (hereinafter called _the Corporation_), upon trust for reclamation and for purposes of public utility:
    
    And whereas the said land is situated below high-water mark and the greater part thereof is usually covered by water, and the Corporation is desirous of reclaiming the same and it is expedient that they should have power to do so, and to raise money for that purpose, and to do other things as hereinafter mentioned:

BE IT THEREFORE ENACTED by the General Assembly of New Zealand in Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:---

##### 1 Short Title
    
*   The Short Title of this Act is The Wellington City Council (Te Aro Reclamation) Act 1879\.
    
    The Short Title was amended, as from 13 August 2004, by section [3(2)][0] Wellington City Council (Te Aro Reclamation) Amendment Act 2004 (2004 No 2(L)) by substituting the words ""Wellington City Council (Te Aro Reclamation)"" for the words ""Te Aro Reclamation"".

##### 2 Interpretation
    
*   In the construction of this Act the words _the Corporation_ and _the Council_ shall respectively mean the Mayor, Councillors, and Citizens of the City of Wellington incorporated under The Municipal Corporations Act 1876; the words _the undertaking_ shall mean the works to be carried out under the provisions of this Act, and any necessary works in connection therewith.

##### 3 Corporation may reclaim land, and enter into contracts for that purpose
    
*   The Corporation may from time to time fill up and reclaim the land described in the said grant or any part thereof, and may for that purpose, if they think fit and expedient, enter into any contract or contracts with any person or persons for the execution of the said work, or of any other works under this Act, upon such terms and conditions as may seem to them proper and reasonable; and may also from time to time, either by themselves or by any contractor for the time being for the execution of the said works, take from any convenient place within the city not being private property, or from any private property within or without the city, with the consent of the owner and of any occupier for the time being thereof, any soil or materials which may be necessary for the said works, and may also by purchase acquire any land from which it may be necessary or expedient to take any such materials as aforesaid, and may from time to time execute and carry out all such other works as they may think expedient, or which may be necessary in connection with and for the purposes of the undertaking.

##### 4 Council to make compensation
    
*   The Corporation shall make to every person having any estate or interest in any land injuriously affected by the execution of the works authorized by this Act, and to every person who may suffer any loss or damage from the exercise of any of the powers hereby given, full compensation for the same, and such compensation shall be ascertained in the manner pointed out in Part 3 of The Public Works Act 1876, which Part of such Act for that and for all other purposes, in so far as the same may be applicable to and not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act, shall be deemed to be incorporated with and to form part of this Act, and apply to the works and other matters authorized by this Act; the word ""borough"" being read therein instead of the words ""county"" or ""road district"" or ""district"", and the words ""Borough Council"" instead of the words ""County Council"" or ""Road Board"" or ""Board:"" Provided always that in ascertaining and determining the title of any claimant to compensation, the Compensation Court shall not be bound to regard strict legal rights only, but may award such compensation in respect of any claim which the Court may consider reasonable and just having regard to all the circumstances.

##### 5 Compensation may be in money or in land
    
*   Compensation in respect of any such claim as aforesaid may be made or awarded either out of the land reclaimed under the provisions of this Act, or in money, as the Corporation may think fit; and, where the Corporation shall elect to make such compensation in land, the value of the land to be given shall be ascertained either by agreement between the claimant and the Corporation, or, in case of difference, by the Court acting under the provisions of The Public Works Act 1876, in the matter of such claim.

##### 6 Council may raise special loan for purposes of undertaking
    
*   The Council may, for the purpose of defraying the cost of any undertaking entered upon under section [three][5] of this Act, and for the payment of any costs, charges, and expenses attending or incidental to the passing of this Act, and of paying any compensation payable under this Act, and of the costs of any proceedings or matters connected with the ascertainment of such compensation, raise by way of special loan, as defined by The Municipal Corporations Act 1876, such sums as may be necessary, subject to all the provisions of The Municipal Corporations Act 1876, in respect of special loans, except that it shall be imperative upon the Council to make provision for the repayment of all sums borrowed for the purposes aforesaid, or any of them, by means of a sinking fund, in manner provided in that behalf by the said Act and this Act.

##### 7 Council may lay out streets, etc
    
*   The Council may, so soon as any part of the said land shall be reclaimed from the sea, lay out and construct streets and squares, or other thoroughfares or public places, through or within any part of the same, or appropriate any part of the same to any other public purpose of utility for the benefit of the city.
