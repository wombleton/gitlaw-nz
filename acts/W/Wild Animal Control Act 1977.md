    *   (b) where prohibited pursuant to subsection (2) or any other Act.
    
    (2) Subject to subsection (3), the Minister may from time to time, by notice in the _Gazette_,---

        *   (iii) whether the presence of that species of deer is likely to cause additional control costs.

If proceedings are not taken within 12 months against the person from whom the article or animal was seized, it shall, at the expiry of that period, be returned to him. Where proceedings are so taken against the aforesaid person, the article or animal shall, when the proceedings are completed, be returned to that person unless the court, where it enters a conviction, directs that the article or animal or any other article, animal, or aircraft used in the commission of the offence but not seized by a warranted officer be forfeited to the Crown, in which case the article or animal shall be forfeited to the Crown accordingly, and shall be disposed of as the Minister directs.

    (4) Where any wild animal or its carcass is sold or disposed of under paragraph (g) of subsection (1), all proceeds from the sale or disposition shall belong to the Crown.
    
    (5) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, the Director-General may, if he thinks fit, at any time restore any animal or thing removed or seized by a warranted officer under this section to the person who owned or was in possession of the animal or thing at the time when it was removed or seized, either unconditionally or upon compliance with such conditions (including payment to the Crown) as the Director-General thinks fit.

    (6) Any warranted officer shall have power to enter at all reasonable times on the land or premises of the holder of any permit or licence or other authority to which any of the provisions of this Act apply, or any other land or premises where he has good reason to believe that an offence against this Act is about to be or is being or has been committed, and inspect any part of the land or premises for the purpose of ascertaining whether the conditions of the permit or licence or other authority are being complied with or, as the case may be, whether any offence against this Act has been committed; and where he has good reason to believe that any offence has been committed against this Act, search any land, or any hut, tent, caravan, bach, or other erection, or any barn, storehouse, or other premises of any description, or any trailer, vehicle, vessel, or aircraft to which paragraph (e) of subsection (1) applies, or any riding or pack animal, or any other device for transportation or carriage found on any premises or on any water:
    
    provided that a warranted officer shall not enter any dwellinghouse or the enclosed garden or curtilage of any dwellinghouse, unless he is authorised by a warrant issued by an issuing officer (within the meaning of [section 3][84] of the Search and Surveillance Act 2012), who shall not grant such a warrant unless he is satisfied that the warranted officer has reasonable grounds for requiring entry into the dwellinghouse, garden, or curtilage.
    
    (7) Any issuing officer (within the meaning of [section 3][84] of the Search and Surveillance Act 2012) who is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that any offence against this Act has been or is being committed within any dwellinghouse, garden, or curtilage may, by warrant under his hand, empower a warranted officer to enter therein for the purpose of detecting that offence.
    
    (8) The Director-General shall supply to every person to be appointed as a warranted officer (except a constable) a written warrant signed by himself or on his behalf evidencing the warranted officer's appointment, and the production of that warrant shall be sufficient proof of the appointment.
    
    (9) The production by any person of evidence that that person is a constable shall, until the contrary is proved, be sufficient authority for that person to have and exercise all the powers of a warranted officer otherwise appointed under this Act.
    
    (10) The provisions of [Part 4][85] of the Search and Surveillance Act 2012 (except [sections 118][86] and [119][87]) apply.

##### 14 Warranted officers' powers of inspection of occupied Crown-owned land
    
*   (1) Any warranted officer or any person authorised by the Director-General may at any time and from time to time enter onto any occupied Crown-owned land, whether held under permit, lease, licence, or other authority, to inspect the adequacy of any wild animal control operations that may be under way, or to inspect the land as to the presence of wild animals, or to assess damage done by wild animals, or to inspect the habitat of any native wildlife that may be threatened by wild animals, or for any other purpose consistent with this Act:
    
    provided that, on the first of any inspections of land held under any permit, lease, licence, or other authority, at least 28 days' prior notice shall be given in writing to the occupier of the land, and on any subsequent inspection made within 6 months of the first inspection and concerned with the same purpose at least 7 days' prior notice shall be given in writing to the occupier of the land:
    
    provided also that, where the occupier of land held under any permit, lease, licence, or other authority has a good and sufficient reason for requesting that any inspection be brought forward or delayed in time, the inspecting officer shall not enter onto the land except on the agreed date unless the suggested advance date cannot be complied with or the delay sought by the occupier is greater than 14 days, in which case the inspection may be carried out as previously notified in writing by the inspecting officer.
    
    (2) Nothing in subsection (1) shall prevent a warranted officer, on production of his warrant of appointment if so required, from entering onto any Crown-owned land at any time where he has good reason to believe that an offence against this Act or any regulations made under this Act is about to be, or is being, or has been, committed:

    (2) Where any occupier, or (where appropriate) the land controlling authority, requests that the Director-General arrange for a wild animal control operation, or where an occupier fails without good and sufficient cause to carry out any direction of the Director-General, the Director-General may, after giving prior notification to the occupier, and (where appropriate) the land controlling authority, of the land, enter onto the land, or arrange that any agent or employee or officer of the Department enter onto the land, and carry out under the supervision of a warranted officer such control measures as are considered by the Director-General to be necessary:
    
    provided that in all cases the Director-General shall give to the occupier, and where appropriate the authority administering the land, not less than 28 days' notice of his intentions.

    provided that the Minister shall not exercise this power where the occupier can establish to the satisfaction of the Minister that:
        
    *   (a) the cost of the control operation would have caused him undue hardship; or
    
    *   (b) he could not obtain the manpower, or the assistance of commercial or recreational hunters, or technical or material needs, to enable him to comply with the direction; or
    
    *   (c) there were other factors that the Minister accepts as sufficient cause for non-compliance with the direction.

    the Director-General may request the owner or occupier or person in control of the land to allow entry onto the land for the purposes of this Act.
    
    (2) Where the owner or occupier or person in control of the land has refused a written request from the Director-General for entry onto the land, the Minister may authorise in writing the Director-General or any other officer or employee or agent or contractor of the Department to enter at any time and from time to time on any land vested in or administered by the Crown, or on any other land, with such assistants as he thinks fit, for all or any of the following purposes:

        provided that, where there is any loss of pasture, farm production, or income other than that derived from the hunting or sale of wild animals as a consequence of any such structures or works on the land, the Minister may, on the production of evidence to his satisfaction of such loss, pay such compensation as he considers fair and reasonable:
    
    *   (d) to erect notices or publish or broadcast information advising or warning of any action being taken under this Act:
    
    *   (e) to have access for any of the purposes specified in this subsection to any other land (whether adjoining or not) on which any such wild animals are present:
    
    *   (f) to do any other act or thing necessary for any of the purposes specified in this subsection.
    
    (3) Before entry on any land pursuant to this section, the Director-General or other officer or employee or agent or contractor of the Department authorised by the Minister shall give at least 28 days' written notice to the owner, occupier, or controlling authority of the land of the intention to have officers, employees, agents, or contractors of the Department, as the case may be, enter thereon or commence wild animal control operations at such time and place as may be specified in the notice, which notice shall advise that an appeal to the Minister for a review of the matter may be lodged with the Minister within 21 days of the giving of the notice, and that the Minister's decision regarding any appeal shall be final.
    
    (4) Where any Crown-owned land or any national park land or maritime park land or any defence area is concerned, the Director-General shall ensure that there is prior consultation with the land controlling authority, and shall include in the authority to enter onto the land issued to any officer, employee, agent, or contractor of the Department such conditions of entry and use of the land as may be laid down by the controlling authority and agreed to by the Director-General.

    (6) Subject to prior consultation with the occupier or the land controlling authority, and having satisfied himself that the authorisation that he intends to grant does not conflict with any Act or bylaw relating to the Crown-owned land to which the said authorisation is to apply, and in the case of any other land that the authorisation that he intends to grant has been discussed with the occupier and will not unduly affect farm management or cause the occupier undue hardship, the Director-General may authorise any person entering on any land pursuant to subsection (1) to bring with him any vehicle, vessel, aircraft, machine, horse, or dog, and any equipment necessary for any of the purposes specified in that subsection, and to convey any necessary supplies or equipment onto or over that land.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Wild Animal Control Act 1977\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 July 2013, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][135] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][136] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][137] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][138] and [17E][139] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
