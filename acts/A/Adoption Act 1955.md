    (2) An adoption order may be made on the application of 2 spouses jointly in respect of a child.
    
    (3) An adoption order may be made in respect of the adoption of a child by the mother or father of the child, either alone or jointly with his or her spouse.

    *   (a) has attained the age of 25 years and is at least 20 years older than the child; or
    
    *   (b) has attained the age of 20 years and is a relative of the child; or
    
    *   (c) is the mother or father of the child.

    (7) In any case where the court has made an adoption order within 1 month after making the order dispensing with consent, any person whose consent is dispensed with under this section may, on notice to every adoptive parent and within 1 month after the making of the order dispensing with consent, make application for the revocation of that order and the discharge of the adoption order to the High Court; and the court to which the application is so made may in its discretion discharge any such order. All the provisions of [section 20][26], so far as they are applicable and with the necessary modifications, shall apply in connection with any such discharge of an adoption order.
