    *   (b) those provisions of [Schedule 2][32] (if any), which apply to that arbitration under subsection (2),---
    
    apply in respect of the arbitration.
    
    (2) A provision of [Schedule 2][32] applies---
        
    *   (a) to an arbitration referred to in subsection (1) which---
            
        *   (i) is an international arbitration as defined in [article 1(3)][37] of Schedule 1; or
        
        *   (ii) is covered by the provisions of the Protocol on Arbitration Clauses (1923); or the Convention on the Execution of Foreign Arbitral Awards (1927), or both,---
        
        only if the parties so agree; and
    
    *   (b) to every other arbitration referred to in subsection (1), unless the parties agree otherwise.

##### 8 Provisions applying where place of arbitration not agreed or determined

##### 10 Arbitrability of disputes

    (2) The fact that an enactment confers jurisdiction in respect of any matter on the High Court or a District Court but does not refer to the determination of that matter by arbitration does not, of itself, indicate that a dispute about that matter is not capable of determination by arbitration.

##### 11 Consumer arbitration agreements

    *   (a) a contract contains an arbitration agreement; and

    the arbitration agreement is enforceable against the consumer only if---
        
    *   (c) the consumer, by separate written agreement entered into by the consumer and the other party to the contract after a dispute has arisen out of, or in relation to, that contract, certifies that, having read and understood the arbitration agreement, the consumer agrees to be bound by it; and

    (2) For the purposes of this section, a person enters into a contract as a consumer if---

    *   (b) the other party to the contract enters into that contract in trade.
    
    (3) Subsection (1) applies to every contract containing an arbitration agreement entered into in New Zealand notwithstanding a provision in the contract to the effect that the contract is governed by a law other than New Zealand law.
    
    (4) For the purposes of [article 4][42] of Schedule 1, subsection (1) shall be treated as if it were a requirement of the arbitration agreement.
    
    (5) Unless a party who is a consumer has, under [article 4][42] of Schedule 1, waived the right to object to non-compliance with subsection (1), an arbitration agreement which is not enforceable by reason of non-compliance with subsection (1) shall be treated as inoperative for the purposes of [article 8(1)][38] of Schedule 1 and as not valid under the law of New Zealand for the purposes of [articles 16(1)][43], [34(2)(a)(i)][44], and [36(1)(a)(i)][41] of Schedule 1\.
    
    (6) Nothing in this section applies to---

##### 12 Powers of arbitral tribunal in deciding disputes
    
*   (1) An arbitration agreement, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, is deemed to provide that an arbitral tribunal---
        
    *   (a) may award any remedy or relief that could have been ordered by the High Court if the dispute had been the subject of civil proceedings in that court:
    
    *   (b) may award interest on the whole or any part of any sum which---

    (4) For the purposes of this section, arbitral proceedings are to be taken as having commenced on the date of the receipt by the respondent of a request for the dispute to be referred to arbitration, or, where the parties have agreed that any other date is to be taken as the date of commencement of the arbitral proceedings, then on that date.
    
    (5) This Act applies to every arbitral award, whether made before or after the commencement of this Act.

    (2) (_deleted_)
    
    (3) An arbitration is international if---
        
    *   (a) the parties to an arbitration agreement have, at the time of the conclusion of that agreement, their places of business in different States; or
    
    *   (b) one of the following places is situated outside the State in which the parties have their places of business:
            
        *   (i) the place of arbitration if determined in, or pursuant to, the arbitration agreement:
        
        *   (ii) any place where a substantial part of the obligations of any commercial or other relationship is to be performed or the place with which the subject matter of the dispute is most closely connected; or
        
        
    
    *   (c) the parties have expressly agreed that the subject matter of the arbitration agreement relates to more than one country.
    
    (4) For the purposes of paragraph (3),---
        
    *   (a) if a party has more than 1 place of business, the place of business is that which has the closest relationship to the arbitration agreement:
    
    *   (b) if a party does not have a place of business, reference is to be made to that party's habitual residence.
    
    

##### 2 Definitions and rules of interpretation
    
*   For the purposes of this schedule,---
        
    *   (a) _arbitration_, _arbitration agreement_, _arbitral tribunal_, and _award_ have the meanings assigned to those terms by [section 2][3]:
    
    *   (b) _court_ means a body or organ of the judicial system of a State:
    
    *   (ba) _interim measure_ has the meaning given to it by [article 17][71]:
    
    *   (c) where a provision of this schedule, except [article 28][100], leaves the parties free to determine a certain issue, such freedom includes the right of the parties to authorise a third party, including an institution, to make that determination:
    
    *   (d) where a provision of this schedule refers to the fact that the parties have agreed or that they may agree or in any other way refers to an agreement of the parties, such agreement includes any arbitration rules referred to in that agreement:
    
    *   (e) where a provision of this schedule, other than in [articles 25(a)][96] and [32(2)(a)][49], refers to a claim, it also applies to a counter-claim, and where it refers to a defence, it also applies to a defence to such counter-claim:
    
    *   (f) article headings are for reference purposes only and are not to be used for purposes of interpretation.
    
    Schedule 1 article 2(ba): inserted, on 18 October 2007, by [section 8(1)][107] of the Arbitration Amendment Act 2007 (2007 No 94).

##### 3 Receipt of written communications
    
*   (1) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties,---
        
    *   (a) any written communication is deemed to have been received if it is delivered to the addressee personally or if it is delivered at the addressee's place of business, habitual residence, or mailing address; if none of these can be found after making a reasonable inquiry, a written communication is deemed to have been received if it is sent to the addressee's last known place of business, habitual residence, or mailing address by registered letter or any other means which provides a record of the attempt to deliver it:
    
    *   (b) the communication is deemed to have been received on the day it is so delivered.
    
    (2) The provisions of this article do not apply to communications in court proceedings.

##### 4 Waiver of right to object
    
*   A party who knows that any provision of this schedule from which the parties may derogate or any requirement under the arbitration agreement has not been complied with and yet proceeds with the arbitration without stating that party's objection to such non-compliance without undue delay or, if a time limit is provided therefor, within such period of time, shall be deemed to have waived the right to object.

*   In matters governed by this schedule, no court shall intervene except where so provided in this schedule.

##### 6 Court or other authority for certain functions of arbitration assistance and supervision

## Chapter 2  
Arbitration agreement

##### 7 Form of arbitration agreement
    
*   (1) An arbitration agreement may be made orally or in writing. Subject to [section 11][12], an arbitration agreement may be in the form of an arbitration clause in a contract or in the form of a separate agreement.
    
    (2) A reference in a contract to a document containing an arbitration clause constitutes an arbitration agreement, provided that the reference is such as to make that clause part of the contract.
    
    Schedule 1 article 7(1): amended, on 1 July 1997, by [section 2][108] of the Arbitration Amendment Act 1998 (1998 No 26).

##### 8 Arbitration agreement and substantive claim before court
    
*   (1) A court before which proceedings are brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement shall, if a party so requests not later than when submitting that party's first statement on the substance of the dispute, stay those proceedings and refer the parties to arbitration unless it finds that the agreement is null and void, inoperative, or incapable of being performed, or that there is not in fact any dispute between the parties with regard to the matters agreed to be referred.
    
    (2) Where proceedings referred to in paragraph (1) have been brought, arbitral proceedings may nevertheless be commenced or continued, and an award may be made, while the issue is pending before the court.

##### 9 Arbitration agreement and interim measures by court
    
*   (1) It is not incompatible with an arbitration agreement for a party to request, before or during arbitral proceedings, from a court an interim measure and for a court to grant such measure.
    
    (2) For the purposes of paragraph (1), the High Court or a District Court has the same powers as an arbitral tribunal to grant an interim measure under [article 17A][73] for the purposes of proceedings before that court, and that article and [article 17B][74] apply accordingly subject to all necessary modifications.
    
    (3) Where a party applies to a court for an interim injunction or other interim order and an arbitral tribunal has already ruled on any matter relevant to the application, the court shall treat the ruling or any finding of fact made in the course of the ruling as conclusive for the purposes of the application.
    
    Schedule 1 article 9(1): amended, on 18 October 2007, by [section 8(2)][107] of the Arbitration Amendment Act 2007 (2007 No 94).

## Chapter 3  
Composition of arbitral tribunal

##### 10 Number of arbitrators
    
*   (1) The parties are free to determine the number of arbitrators.
    
    (2) Failing such determination,---
        
    *   (a) in the case of international arbitration, the number of arbitrators shall be 3:
    
    *   (b) in every other case, the number of arbitrators shall be 1\.
    
    

##### 11 Appointment of arbitrators
    
*   (1) No person shall be precluded by reason of that person's nationality from acting as an arbitrator, unless otherwise agreed by the parties.
    
    (2) The parties are free to agree on a procedure of appointing the arbitrator or arbitrators, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (4) and (5).
    
    (3) Failing such agreement,---
        
    *   (a) in an arbitration with 3 arbitrators and 2 parties, each party shall appoint 1 arbitrator, and the 2 arbitrators thus appointed shall appoint the third arbitrator; if a party fails to appoint the arbitrator within 30 days of receipt of a request to do so from the other party, or if the 2 arbitrators fail to agree on the third arbitrator within 30 days of their appointment, the appointment shall be made, upon request of a party, by the High Court:
    
    *   (b) in an arbitration with a sole arbitrator, if the parties are unable to agree on the arbitrator, that arbitrator shall be appointed, upon request of a party, by the High Court.
    
    (4) Where, under an appointment procedure agreed upon by the parties,---
        
    *   (a) a party fails to act as required under such procedure; or
    
    *   (b) the parties, or 2 arbitrators, are unable to reach an agreement expected of them under such procedure; or
    
    *   (c) a third party, including an institution, fails to perform any function entrusted to it under such procedure,---
    
    any party may request the High Court to take the necessary measure, unless the agreement on the appointment procedure provides other means for securing the appointment.
    
    (5) A decision on a matter entrusted by paragraphs (3), (4), or (6) to the High Court shall be subject to no appeal. The court, in appointing an arbitrator, shall have due regard to any qualifications required of the arbitrator by the agreement of the parties and to such considerations as are likely to secure the appointment of an independent and impartial arbitrator and, in the case of a sole or third arbitrator, shall, in the case of an international arbitration, take into account as well the advisability of appointing an arbitrator of a nationality other than those of the parties.
    
    (6) In an arbitration, where---
        
    *   (a) the parties have agreed to an arbitration with 2 or 4 or more arbitrators; or
    
    *   (b) there are 3 arbitrators and more than 2 parties,---
    
    and no procedure for the appointment of arbitrators has been agreed upon, the High Court may, upon request of a party, appoint the requisite number of arbitrators, having due regard to the matters referred to in paragraph (5).

##### 12 Grounds for challenge
    
*   (1) A person who is approached in connection with that person's possible appointment as an arbitrator shall disclose any circumstances likely to give rise to justifiable doubts as to that person's impartiality or independence. An arbitrator, from the time of appointment and throughout the arbitral proceedings, shall without delay disclose any such circumstances to the parties unless they have already been informed of them by that arbitrator.
    
    (2) An arbitrator may be challenged only if circumstances exist that give rise to justifiable doubts as to that arbitrator's impartiality or independence, or if that arbitrator does not possess qualifications agreed to by the parties. A party may challenge an arbitrator appointed by that party, or in whose appointment that party has participated, only for reasons of which that party becomes aware after the appointment has been made.

##### 13 Challenge procedure
    
*   (1) The parties are free to agree on a procedure for challenging an arbitrator, subject to the provisions of paragraph (3).
    
    (2) Failing such agreement, a party who intends to challenge an arbitrator shall, within 15 days after becoming aware of the constitution of the arbitral tribunal or after becoming aware of any circumstance referred to in [article 12(2)][64], send a written statement of the reasons for the challenge to the arbitral tribunal. Unless the challenged arbitrator withdraws from office or the other party agrees to the challenge, the arbitral tribunal shall decide on the challenge.
    
    (3) If a challenge under any procedure agreed upon by the parties or under the procedure of paragraph (2) is not successful, the challenging party may request, within 30 days after having received notice of the decision rejecting the challenge, the High Court to decide on the challenge, which decision shall be subject to no appeal; while such a request is pending, the arbitral tribunal, including the challenged arbitrator, may continue the arbitral proceedings and make an award.

##### 14 Failure or impossibility to act
    
*   (1) If an arbitrator becomes _de jure_ or de facto (in law or in fact) unable to perform the functions of that office or for other reasons fails to act without undue delay, that arbitrator's mandate terminates on withdrawal from office or, if the parties agree, on the termination. Otherwise, if a controversy remains concerning any of those grounds, any party may request the High Court to decide on the termination of the mandate, which decision shall be subject to no appeal.
    
    (2) If, under this article or [article 13(2)][65], an arbitrator withdraws from office or a party agrees to the termination of the mandate of an arbitrator, this does not imply acceptance of the validity of any ground referred to in this article or [article 12(2)][64].

##### 15 Appointment of substitute arbitrator
    
*   (1) Where the mandate of an arbitrator terminates under [article 13][65] or [14][66], or because of withdrawal from office for any other reason, or because of the revocation of that arbitrator's mandate by agreement of the parties, or in any other case of termination of that mandate, a substitute arbitrator shall be appointed according to the rules that were applicable to the appointment of the arbitrator being replaced.
    
    (2) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties,---
        
    *   (a) where the sole or the presiding arbitrator is replaced, any hearings previously held shall be repeated; and
    
    *   (b) where an arbitrator, other than a sole or a presiding arbitrator is replaced, any hearings previously held may be repeated at the discretion of the arbitral tribunal.
    
    (3) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, an order or ruling of the arbitral tribunal made prior to the replacement of an arbitrator under this article is not invalid solely because there has been a change in the composition of the arbitral tribunal.

## Chapter 4  
Jurisdiction of arbitral tribunal

##### 16 Competence of arbitral tribunal to rule on its jurisdiction
    
*   (1) The arbitral tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement. For that purpose, an arbitration clause which forms part of a contract shall be treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract. A decision by the arbitral tribunal that the contract is null and void shall not entail _ipso jure_ (necessarily) the invalidity of the arbitration clause.
    
    (2) A plea that the arbitral tribunal does not have jurisdiction shall be raised not later than the submission of the statement of defence. A party is not precluded from raising such a plea by the fact that that party has appointed, or participated in the appointment of, an arbitrator. A plea that the arbitral tribunal is exceeding the scope of its authority shall be raised as soon as the matter alleged to be beyond the scope of its authority is raised during the arbitral proceedings. The arbitral tribunal may, in either case, admit a later plea if it considers the delay justified.
    
    (3) The arbitral tribunal may rule on a plea referred to in paragraph (2) either as a preliminary question or in an award on the merits. If the arbitral tribunal rules on such a plea as a preliminary question, any party may request, within 30 days after having received notice of that ruling, the High Court to decide the matter, which decision shall be subject to no appeal; while such a request is pending, the arbitral tribunal may continue the arbitral proceedings and make an award.

    *   (a) harm not adequately reparable by an award of damages is likely to result if the measure is not granted; and
    
    *   (b) the harm substantially outweighs the harm that is likely to result to the respondent if the measure is granted; and

*   Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, if, without showing sufficient cause,---

    *   (d) the claimant fails to prosecute the claim, the arbitral tribunal may make an award dismissing the claim or give directions, with or without conditions, for the speedy determination of the claim.

    *   (b) the High Court or a District Court may order any witness to submit to examination on oath or affirmation before the arbitral tribunal, or before an officer of the court, or any other person for the use of the arbitral tribunal:

        *   (i) the discovery of documents and interrogatories:
        
        *   (ii) the issue of a commission or request for the taking of evidence out of the jurisdiction:
        
        *   (iii) the detention, preservation, or inspection of any property or thing which is in issue in the arbitral proceedings and authorising for any of those purposes any person to enter upon any land or building in the possession of a party, or authorising any sample to be taken or any observation to be made or experiment to be tried which may be necessary or expedient for the purpose of obtaining full information or evidence.

*   (1) The arbitral tribunal shall decide the dispute in accordance with such rules of law as are chosen by the parties as applicable to the substance of the dispute. Any designation of the law or legal system of a given State shall be construed, unless otherwise expressed, as directly referring to the substantive law of that State and not to its conflict of laws rules.
    
    (2) Failing any designation by the parties, the arbitral tribunal shall apply the law determined by the conflict of laws rules which it considers applicable.
    
    (3) The arbitral tribunal shall decide _ex aequo et bono_ or as _amiable compositeur_ (according to considerations of general justice and fairness) only if the parties have expressly authorised it to do so.

##### 30 Settlement
    
*   (1) If, during arbitral proceedings, the parties settle the dispute, the arbitral tribunal shall terminate the proceedings and, if requested by the parties and not objected to by the arbitral tribunal, record the settlement in the form of an arbitral award on agreed terms.

    *   (b) the parties agree on the termination of the proceedings:
    
    *   (c) the arbitral tribunal finds that the continuation of the proceedings has for any other reason become unnecessary or impossible.
    
    (3) The mandate of the arbitral tribunal terminates with the termination of the arbitral proceedings, subject to the provisions of [articles 33][104] and [34(4)][44].
    
    (4) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the death of a party does not terminate the arbitral proceedings or the authority of the arbitral tribunal.

##### 33 Correction and interpretation of award; additional award

    (2) The arbitral tribunal may correct any error of the type referred to in paragraph (1)(a) on its own initiative within 30 days of the date of the award.
    
    (3) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, a party, with notice to the other party, may request, within 30 days of receipt of the award, the arbitral tribunal to make an additional award as to claims presented in the arbitral proceedings but omitted from the award. If the arbitral tribunal considers the request to be justified, it shall make the additional award within 60 days.
    
    (4) The arbitral tribunal may extend, if necessary, the period of time within which it shall make a correction, interpretation, or an additional award under paragraphs (1) or (3).

Recourse against award

##### 34 Application for setting aside as exclusive recourse against arbitral award
    
*   (1) Recourse to a court against an arbitral award may be made only by an application for setting aside in accordance with paragraphs (2) and (3).
    
    (2) An arbitral award may be set aside by the High Court only if---
        
    *   (a) the party making the application furnishes proof that---
            
        *   (i) a party to the arbitration agreement was under some incapacity, or the said agreement is not valid under the law to which the parties have subjected it, or, failing any indication on that question, under the law of New Zealand; or
        
        *   (ii) the party making the application was not given proper notice of the appointment of an arbitrator or of the arbitral proceedings or was otherwise unable to present that party's case; or
        
        *   (iii) the award deals with a dispute not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration, provided that, if the decisions on matters submitted to arbitration can be separated from those not so submitted, only that part of the award which contains decisions on matters not submitted to arbitration may be set aside; or
        
        *   (iv) the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties, unless such agreement was in conflict with a provision of this schedule from which the parties cannot derogate, or, failing such agreement, was not in accordance with this schedule; or
        
        
    
    *   (b) the High Court finds that---
            
        *   (i) the subject matter of the dispute is not capable of settlement by arbitration under the law of New Zealand; or
        
        *   (ii) the award is in conflict with the public policy of New Zealand.
        
        
    
    (3) An application for setting aside may not be made after 3 months have elapsed from the date on which the party making that application had received the award or, if a request had been made under [article 33][104], from the date on which that request had been disposed of by the arbitral tribunal. This paragraph does not apply to an application for setting aside on the ground that the award was induced or affected by fraud or corruption.
    
    (4) The High Court, when asked to set aside an award, may, where appropriate and so requested by a party, suspend the setting aside proceedings for a period of time determined by it in order to give the arbitral tribunal an opportunity to resume the arbitral proceedings or to take such other action as in the arbitral tribunal's opinion will eliminate the grounds for setting aside.
    
    (5) Where an application is made to set aside an award, the High Court may order that any money made payable by the award shall be brought into court or otherwise secured pending the determination of the application.
    
    (6) For the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting the generality of paragraph (2)(b)(ii), it is hereby declared that an award is in conflict with the public policy of New Zealand if---
        
    *   (a) the making of the award was induced or affected by fraud or corruption; or
    
    *   (b) a breach of the rules of natural justice occurred---
            
        *   (i) during the arbitral proceedings; or
        
        *   (ii) in connection with the making of the award.

        *   (ii) the recognition or enforcement of the award would be contrary to the public policy of New Zealand.
        
        
    
    (2) If an application for setting aside or suspension of an award has been made to a court referred to in paragraph (1)(a)(v), the court where recognition or enforcement is sought may, if it considers it proper, adjourn its decision and may also, on the application of the party claiming recognition or enforcement of the award, order the other party to provide appropriate security.
    
    (3) For the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting the generality of paragraph (1)(b)(ii), it is hereby declared that an award is contrary to the public policy of New Zealand if---
        
    *   (a) the making of the award was induced or affected by fraud or corruption; or
    
    *   (b) a breach of the rules of natural justice occurred---
            
        *   (i) during the arbitral proceedings; or
        
        *   (ii) in connection with the making of the award.

##### 1 Default appointment of arbitrators
    
*   (1) For the purposes of [article 11][63] of Schedule 1, the parties shall be taken as having agreed on the procedure for appointing the arbitrator or arbitrators set out in subclauses (2) to (5), unless the parties agree otherwise.
    
    (2) In an arbitration with 3 arbitrators and 2 parties, each party shall appoint 1 arbitrator, and the 2 arbitrators thus appointed shall appoint the third arbitrator.
    
    (3) In an arbitration with---
        
    *   (a) a sole arbitrator; or
    
    *   (b) 2 or 4 or more arbitrators; or
    
    *   (c) 3 arbitrators and more than 2 parties,---

    *   (a) a party fails to act as required under such procedure; or
    
    *   (b) the parties, or the arbitrators, are unable to reach an agreement expected of them under such procedure; or
    
    *   (c) a third party, including an institution, fails to perform any function entrusted to it under such procedure,---
    
    any party may, by written communication delivered to every such party, arbitrator or third party, specify the details of that person's default and propose that, if that default is not remedied within the period specified in the communication (being not less than 7 days after the date on which the communication is received by all of the persons to whom it is delivered), a person named in the communication shall be appointed to such vacant office of arbitrator as is specified in the communication, or the arbitral tribunal shall consist only of the person or persons who have already been appointed to the office of arbitrator.
    
    (5) If the default specified in the communication is not remedied within the period specified in the communication,---
        
    *   (a) the proposal made in the communication shall take effect as part of the arbitration agreement on the day after the expiration of that period; and
    
    *   (b) the arbitration agreement shall be read with all necessary modifications accordingly.
    
    

##### 2 Consolidation of arbitral proceedings
    
*   (1) Where arbitral proceedings all have the same arbitral tribunal,---
        
    *   (a) the arbitral tribunal may, on the application of at least 1 party in each of the arbitral proceedings, order---
            
        *   (i) those proceedings to be consolidated on such terms as the arbitral tribunal thinks just; or
        
        *   (ii) those proceedings to be heard at the same time, or one immediately after the other; or
        
        *   (iii) any of those proceedings to be stayed until after the determination of any other of them:
        
        
    
    *   (b) if an application has been made to the arbitral tribunal under paragraph (a) and the arbitral tribunal refuses or fails to make an order under that paragraph, the High Court may, on application by a party in any of the proceedings, make any such order as could have been made by the arbitral tribunal.
    
    (2) Where arbitral proceedings do not all have the same arbitral tribunal,---
        
    *   (a) the arbitral tribunal for any one of the arbitral proceedings may, on the application of a party in the proceedings, provisionally order---
            
        *   (i) the proceedings to be consolidated with other arbitral proceedings on such terms as the arbitral tribunal thinks just; or
        
        *   (ii) the proceedings to be heard at the same time as other arbitral proceedings, or one immediately after the other; or
        
        *   (iii) any of those proceedings to be stayed until after the determination of any other of them:
        
        
    
    *   (b) an order ceases to be provisional when consistent provisional orders have been made for all of the arbitral proceedings concerned:
    
    *   (c) the arbitral tribunals may communicate with each other for the purpose of conferring on the desirability of making orders under this subclause and of deciding on the terms of any such order:
    
    *   (d) if a provisional order is made for at least one of the arbitral proceedings concerned, but the arbitral tribunal for another of the proceedings refuses or fails to make such an order (having received an application from a party to make such an order), the High Court may, on application by a party in any of the proceedings, make an order or orders that could have been made under this subclause:
    
    *   (e) if inconsistent provisional orders are made for the arbitral proceedings, the High Court may, on application by a party in any of the proceedings, alter the orders to make them consistent.
    
    (3) When arbitral proceedings are to be consolidated under subclause (2), the arbitral tribunal for the consolidated proceedings shall be that agreed on for the purpose by all the parties to the individual proceedings, but, failing such an agreement, the High Court may appoint an arbitral tribunal for the consolidated proceedings.
    
    (4) An order or a provisional order may not be made under this clause unless it appears---
        
    *   (a) that some common question of law or fact arises in all of the arbitral proceedings; or
    
    *   (b) that the rights to relief claimed in all of the proceedings are in respect of, or arise out of, the same transaction or series of transactions; or
    
    *   (c) that for some other reason it is desirable to make the order or provisional order.
    
    (5) Any proceedings before an arbitral tribunal for the purposes of this clause shall be treated as part of the arbitral proceedings concerned.
    
    (6) Arbitral proceedings may be commenced or continued, although an application to consolidate them is pending under subclause (1) or (2) and although a provisional order has been made in relation to them under subclause (2).
    
    (7) Subclauses (1) and (2) apply in relation to arbitral proceedings whether or not all or any of the parties are common to some or all of the proceedings.
    
    (8) There shall be no appeal from any decision of the High Court under this clause.
    
    (9) Nothing in this clause prevents the parties to 2 or more arbitral proceedings from agreeing to consolidate those proceedings and taking such steps as are necessary to effect that consolidation.

##### 3 Powers relating to conduct of arbitral proceedings
    
*   (1) For the purposes of [article 19][90] of Schedule 1, and unless the parties agree otherwise, the parties shall be taken as having agreed that the powers conferred upon the arbitral tribunal include the power to---

    *   (k) make an interim, interlocutory or partial award.
    
    (2) Notwithstanding anything in [article 5][57] of Schedule 1, the arbitral tribunal, or a party with the approval of the arbitral tribunal, may request from the court assistance in the exercise of any power conferred on the arbitral tribunal under subclause (1).
    
    (3) If a request is made under subclause (2), the High Court or a District Court shall have, for the purposes of the arbitral proceedings, the same power to make an order for the doing of any thing which the arbitral tribunal is empowered to order under subclause (1) as it would have in civil proceedings before that court.

##### 4 Determination of preliminary point of law by court
    
*   (1) Notwithstanding anything in [article 5][57] of Schedule 1, on an application to the High Court by any party---
        
    *   (a) with the consent of the arbitral tribunal; or
    
    *   (b) with the consent of every other party,---
    
    the High Court shall have jurisdiction to determine any question of law arising in the course of the arbitration.
    
    (2) The High Court shall not entertain an application under subclause (1)(a) with respect to any question of law unless it is satisfied that the determination of the question of law concerned---
        
    *   (a) might produce substantial savings in costs to the parties; and
    
    *   (b) might, having regard to all the circumstances, substantially affect the rights of 1 or more of the parties.
    
    (3) With the leave of the High Court, any party may, within 1 month from the date of any determination of the High Court, under this clause or within such further time as that court may allow, appeal from that determination to the Court of Appeal.
    
    (4) If the High Court refuses to grant leave to appeal under subclause (3), the Court of Appeal may grant special leave to appeal.

##### 5 Appeals on questions of law
    
*   (1) Notwithstanding anything in [articles 5][57] or [34][44] of Schedule 1, any party may appeal to the High Court on any question of law arising out of an award---
        
    *   (a) if the parties have so agreed before the making of that award; or
    
    *   (b) with the consent of every other party given after the making of that award; or
    
    *   (c) with the leave of the High Court.
    
    (2) The High Court shall not grant leave under subclause (1)(c) unless it considers that, having regard to all the circumstances, the determination of the question of law concerned could substantially affect the rights of 1 or more of the parties.
    
    (3) The High Court may grant leave under subclause (1)(c) on such conditions as it sees fit.
    
    (4) On the determination of an appeal under this clause, the High Court may, by order,---
        
    *   (a) confirm, vary, or set aside the award; or
    
    *   (b) remit the award, together with the High Court's opinion on the question of law which was the subject of the appeal, to the arbitral tribunal for reconsideration or, where a new arbitral tribunal has been appointed, to that arbitral tribunal for consideration,---
    
    and, where the award is remitted under paragraph (b), the arbitral tribunal shall, unless the order otherwise directs, make the award not later than 3 months after the date of the order.
    
    (5) With the leave of the High Court, any party may appeal to the Court of Appeal from any refusal of the High Court to grant leave or from any determination of the High Court under this clause.
    
    (6) If the High Court refuses to grant leave to appeal under subclause (5), the Court of Appeal may grant special leave to appeal.
    
    (7) Where the award of an arbitral tribunal is varied on an appeal under this clause, the award as varied shall have effect (except for the purposes of this clause) as if it were the award of the arbitral tribunal; and the party relying on the award or applying for its enforcement under [article 35(2)][40] of Schedule 1 shall supply the duly authenticated original order of the High Court varying the award or a duly certified copy.
    
    (8) [Article 34(3) and (4)][44] of Schedule 1 apply to an appeal under this clause as they do to an application for the setting aside of an award under that article.
    
    (9) For the purposes of [article 36][41] of Schedule 1,---
        
    *   (a) an appeal under this clause shall be treated as an application for the setting aside of an award; and
    
    *   (b) an award which has been remitted by the High Court under subclause (4)(b) to the original or a new arbitral tribunal shall be treated as an award which has been suspended.
    
    (10) For the purposes of this clause, _question of law_---
        
    *   (a) includes an error of law that involves an incorrect interpretation of the applicable law (whether or not the error appears on the record of the decision); but
    
    *   (b) does not include any question as to whether---
            
        *   (i) the award or any part of the award was supported by any evidence or any sufficient or substantial evidence; and
        
        *   (ii) the arbitral tribunal drew the correct factual inferences from the relevant primary facts.
        
        
    
    Schedule 2 clause 5(10): added, on 18 October 2007, by [section 9][116] of the Arbitration Amendment Act 2007 (2007 No 94).

##### 6 Costs and expenses of an arbitration
    
*   (1) Unless the parties agree otherwise,---
        
    *   (a) the costs and expenses of an arbitration, being the legal and other expenses of the parties, the fees and expenses of the arbitral tribunal, and any other expenses related to the arbitration shall be as fixed and allocated by the arbitral tribunal in its award under [article 31][104] of Schedule 1, or any additional award under [article 33(3)][104] of Schedule 1; or
    
    *   (b) in the absence of an award or additional award fixing and allocating the costs and expenses of the arbitration, each party shall be responsible for the legal and other expenses of that party and for an equal share of the fees and expenses of the arbitral tribunal and any other expenses relating to the arbitration.
    
    (2) Unless the parties agree otherwise, the parties shall be taken as having agreed that,---
        
    *   (a) if a party makes an offer to another party to settle the dispute or part of the dispute and the offer is not accepted and the award of the arbitral tribunal is no more favourable to the other party than was the offer, the arbitral tribunal, in fixing and allocating the costs and expenses of the arbitration, may take the fact of the offer into account in awarding costs and expenses in respect of the period from the making of the offer to the making of the award; and
    
    *   (b) the fact that an offer to settle has been made shall not be communicated to the arbitral tribunal until it has made a final determination of all aspects of the dispute other than the fixing and allocation of costs and expenses.
    
    (3) Where an award or additional award made by an arbitral tribunal fixes or allocates the costs and expenses of the arbitration, or both, the High Court may, on the application of a party, if satisfied that the amount or the allocation of those costs and expenses is unreasonable in all the circumstances, make an order varying their amount or allocation, or both. The arbitral tribunal is entitled to appear and be heard on any application under this subclause.
    
    (4) Where---
        
    *   (a) an arbitral tribunal refuses to deliver its award before the payment of its fees and expenses; and
    
    *   (b) an application has been made under subclause (3),---
    
    the High Court may order the arbitral tribunal to release the award on such conditions as the court sees fit.
    
    (5) An application may not be made under subclause (3) after 3 months have elapsed from the date on which the party making the application received any award or additional award fixing and allocating the costs and expenses of the arbitration.
    
    (6) There shall be no appeal from any decision of the High Court under this clause.

##### 7 Extension of time for commencing arbitration proceedings
    
*   (1) Where an arbitration agreement provides that no arbitral proceedings are to be commenced unless steps have been taken to commence the proceedings within the time specified in the agreement, the High Court or a District Court, as the case may be, may, notwithstanding that the specified time has expired, extend the time for such period as it thinks fit, if, in its opinion, undue hardship would otherwise be caused to the parties.
    
    (2) An extension may be subject to any such conditions as the justice of the case may require.

## Schedule 3  
Treaties relating to arbitration

[s 5][6]

## Protocol on Arbitration Clauses

#### \[Opened for signature at Geneva on 24 September 1923\]

THE undersigned, being duly authorised, declare that they accept, on behalf of the countries which they represent, the following provisions:
    
*   1\. Each of the Contracting States recognises the validity of an agreement whether relating to existing or future differences between parties subject respectively to the jurisdiction of different Contracting States by which the parties to a contract agree to submit to arbitration all or any differences that may arise in connection with such contract relating to commercial matters or to any other matter capable of settlement by arbitration, whether or not the arbitration is to take place in a country to whose jurisdiction none of the parties is subject.
    
    Each Contracting State reserves the right to limit the obligation mentioned above to contracts which are considered as commercial under its national law. Any Contracting State which avails itself of this right will notify the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, in order that the other Contracting States may be so informed.

*   2\. The arbitral procedure, including the constitution of the arbitral tribunal, shall be governed by the will of the parties and by the law of the country in whose territory the arbitration takes place.
    
    The Contracting States agree to facilitate all steps in the procedure which require to be taken in their own territories, in accordance with the provisions of their law governing arbitral procedure applicable to existing differences.

*   3\. Each Contracting State undertakes to ensure the execution by its authorities and in accordance with the provisions of its national laws of arbitral awards made in its own territory under the preceding articles.

*   4\. The tribunals of the Contracting Parties, on being seized of a dispute regarding a contract made between persons to whom Article 1 applies and including an arbitration agreement, whether referring to present or future differences, which is valid in virtue of the said article and capable of being carried into effect, shall refer the parties on the application of either of them to the decision of the arbitrators.
    
    Such reference shall not prejudice the competence of the judicial tribunals in case the agreement or the arbitration cannot proceed or become inoperative.

*   5\. The present protocol, which shall remain open for signature by all States, shall be ratified. The ratifications shall be deposited as soon as possible with the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, who shall notify such deposit to all the signatory States.

*   6\. The present protocol shall come into force as soon as 2 ratifications have been deposited. Thereafter it will take effect, in the case of each Contracting State, 1 month after the notification by the Secretary-General of the deposit of its ratification.

*   7\. The present protocol may be denounced by any Contracting State on giving one year's notice. Denunciation shall be effected by a notification addressed to the Secretary-General of the League, who will immediately transmit copies of such notification to all the other signatory States and inform them of the date on which it was received. The denunciation shall take effect one year after the date on which it was notified to the Secretary-General, and shall operate only in respect of the notifying State.

*   8\. The Contracting States may declare that their acceptance of the present protocol does not include any or all of the under-mentioned territories---that is to say, their colonies, overseas possessions or territories, protectorates, or the territories over which they exercise a mandate.
    
    The said States may subsequently adhere separately on behalf of any territory thus excluded. The Secretary-General of the League of Nations shall be informed as soon as possible of such adhesions. He shall notify such adhesions to all signatory States. They will take effect one month after the notification by the Secretary-General to all signatory States.
    
    The Contracting States may also denounce the protocol separately on behalf of any of the territories referred to above. Article 7 applies to such denunciation.

## Convention on the Execution of Foreign Arbitral Awards

#### \[Opened for signature at Geneva on 26 September 1927\]

### Article 1

IN the territories of any High Contracting Party to which the present convention applies, an arbitral award made in pursuance of an agreement, whether relating to existing or future differences (hereinafter called ""a submission to arbitration"") covered by the Protocol on Arbitration Clauses, opened at Geneva on September 24th, 1923, shall be recognised as binding and shall be enforced in accordance with the rules of the procedure of the territory where the award is relied upon, provided that the said award has been made in a territory of one of the High Contracting Parties to which the present convention applies and between persons who are subject to the jurisdiction of one of the High Contracting Parties.

To obtain such recognition or enforcement, it shall, further, be necessary---
    
*   (a) That the award has been made in pursuance of a submission to arbitration which is valid under the law applicable thereto:

*   (b) That the subject matter of the award is capable of settlement by arbitration under the law of the country in which the award is sought to be relied upon:

*   (c) That the award has been made by the arbitral tribunal provided for in the submission to arbitration, or constituted in the manner agreed upon by the parties and in conformity with the law governing the arbitration procedure:

*   (d) That the award has become final in the country in which it has been made, in the sense that it will not be considered as such if it is open to _opposition, appel_ or _pourvoi en cassation_ (in the countries where such forms of procedure exist) or if it is proved that any proceedings for the purpose of contesting the validity of the award are pending:

*   (e) That the recognition or enforcement of the award is not contrary to the public policy or to the principles of the law of the country in which it is sought to be relied upon.

### Article 2

Even if the conditions laid down in Article 1 hereof are fulfilled, recognition and enforcement of the award shall be refused if the Court is satisfied---
    
*   (a) That the award has been annulled in the country in which it was made:

*   (b) That the party against whom it is sought to use the award was not given notice of the arbitration proceedings in sufficient time to enable him to present his case; or that, being under a legal incapacity, he was not properly represented:

*   (c) That the award does not deal with the differences contemplated by or falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration or that it contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration.

If the award has not covered all the questions submitted to the arbitral tribunal, the competent authority of the country, where recognition or enforcement of the award is sought can, if it think fit, postpone such recognition or enforcement or grant it subject to such guarantee as that authority may decide.

### Article 3

If the party against whom the award has been made proves that, under the law governing the arbitration procedure, there is a ground, other than the grounds referred to in Article 1(a) and (c), and Article 2(b) and (c), entitling him to contest the validity of the award in a Court of law, the Court may, if it thinks fit, either refuse recognition or enforcement of the award or adjourn the consideration thereof, giving such party a reasonable time within which to have the award annulled by the competent tribunal.

### Article 4

The party relying upon an award or claiming its enforcement must supply, in particular:
    
*   (1) The original award or a copy thereof duly authenticated, according to the requirements of the law of the country in which it was made:

*   (2) Documentary or other evidence to prove that the award has become final, in the sense defined in Article 1(d), in the country in which it was made:

*   (3) When necessary, documentary or other evidence to prove that the conditions laid down in Article 1, paragraph 1 and paragraph 2(a) and (c), have been fulfilled.

A translation of the award and of the other documents mentioned in this article into the official language of the country where the award is sought to be relied upon may be demanded. Such translation must be certified correct by a diplomatic or consular agent of the country to which the party who seeks to rely upon the award belongs or by a sworn translator of the country where the award is sought to be relied upon.

### Article 5

The provisions of the above articles shall not deprive any interested party of the right of availing himself of an arbitral award in the manner and to the extent allowed by the law or the treaties of the country where such award is sought to be relied upon.

### Article 6

The present convention applies only to arbitral awards made after the coming into force of the Protocol on the Arbitration Clauses, opened at Geneva on September 24th, 1923\.

### Article 7

The present convention, which will remain open to the signature of all the signatories of the Protocol of 1923 on Arbitration Clauses, shall be ratified.

It may be ratified only on behalf of those members of the League of Nations and non-member States on whose behalf the Protocol of 1923 shall have been ratified.

Ratifications shall be deposited as soon as possible with the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, who will notify such deposit to all the signatories.

### Article 8

The present convention shall come into force 3 months after it shall have been ratified on behalf of 2 High Contracting Parties. Thereafter, it shall take effect, in the case of each High Contracting Party, 3 months after the deposit of the ratification on its behalf with the Secretary-General of the League of Nations.

### Article 9

The present convention may be denounced on behalf of any member of the League or non-member State. Denunciation shall be notified in writing to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, who will immediately send a copy thereof, certified to be in conformity with the notification, to all the other Contracting Parties, at the same time informing them of the date on which he received it.

The denunciation shall come into force only in respect of the High Contracting Party which shall have notified it, and one year after such notification shall have reached the Secretary-General of the League of Nations.

The denunciation of the Protocol on Arbitration Clauses shall entail, _ipso facto_, the denunciation of the present convention.

### Article 10

The present convention does not apply to the colonies, protectorates, or territories under suzerainty or mandate of any High Contracting Party unless they are specially mentioned.

The application of this convention to one or more of such colonies, protectorates, or territories to which the Protocol on Arbitration Clauses, opened at Geneva on September 24th, 1923, applies, can be effected at any time by means of a declaration addressed to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations by one of the High Contracting Parties.

Such declaration shall take effect 3 months after the deposit thereof.

The High Contracting Parties can at any time denounce the convention for all or any of the colonies, protectorates, or territories referred to above. Article 9 hereof applies to such denunciation.

### Article 11

A certified copy of the present convention shall be transmitted by the Secretary-General of the League of Nations to every member of the League of Nations and to every non-member State which signs the same.

## Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards

#### \[Adopted at New York by the United Nations Conference on International Commercial Arbitration on 10 June 1958\]

### Article I
    
*   1\. This Convention shall apply to the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards made in the territory of a State other than the State where the recognition and enforcement of such awards are sought, and arising out of differences between persons, whether physical or legal. It shall also apply to arbitral awards not considered as domestic awards in the State where their recognition and enforcement are sought.

*   2\. The term ""arbitral awards"" shall include not only awards made by arbitrators appointed for each case but also those made by permanent arbitral bodies to which the parties have submitted.

*   3\. When signing, ratifying or acceding to this Convention, or notifying extension under article X hereof, any State may on the basis of reciprocity declare that it will apply the Convention to the recognition and enforcement of awards made only in the territory of another Contracting State. It may also declare that it will apply the Convention only to differences arising out of legal relationships, whether contractual or not, which are considered as commercial under the national law of the State making such declaration.

### Article II
    
*   1\. Each Contracting State shall recognise an agreement in writing under which the parties undertake to submit to arbitration all or any differences which have arisen or which may arise between them in respect of a defined legal relationship, whether contractual or not, concerning a subject matter capable of settlement by arbitration.

*   2\. The term ""agreement in writing"" shall include an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement, signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams.

*   3\. The court of a Contracting State, when seized of an action in a matter in respect of which the parties have made an agreement within the meaning of this article, shall, at the request of one of the parties, refer the parties to arbitration, unless it finds that the said agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed.

### Article III

Each Contracting State shall recognise arbitral awards as binding and enforce them in accordance with the rules of procedure of the territory where the award is relied upon, under the conditions laid down in the following articles. There shall not be imposed substantially more onerous conditions or higher fees or charges on the recognition or enforcement of arbitral awards to which this Convention applies than are imposed on the recognition or enforcement of domestic arbitral awards.

### Article IV
    
*   1\. To obtain the recognition and enforcement mentioned in the preceding article, the party applying for recognition and enforcement shall, at the time of the application, supply:
        
    *   _(a)_ The duly authenticated original award or a duly certified copy thereof;
    
    *   _(b)_ The original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof.
    
    

*   2\. If the said award or agreement is not made in an official language of the country in which the award is relied upon, the party applying for recognition and enforcement of the award shall produce a translation of these documents into such language. The translation shall be certified by an official or sworn translator or by a diplomatic or consular agent.

### Article V
    
*   1\. Recognition and enforcement of the award may be refused, at the request of the party against whom it is invoked, only if that party furnishes to the competent authority where the recognition and enforcement is sought, proof that:
        
    *   _(a)_ The parties to the agreement referred to in article II were, under the law applicable to them, under some incapacity, or the said agreement is not valid under the law to which the parties have subjected it or, failing any indication thereon, under the law of the country where the award was made; or
    
    *   _(b)_ The party against whom the award is invoked was not given proper notice of the appointment of the arbitrator or of the arbitration proceedings or was otherwise unable to present his case; or
    
    *   _(c)_ The award deals with a difference not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or it contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration, provided that, if the decisions on matters submitted to arbitration can be separated from those not so submitted, that part of the award which contains decisions on matters submitted to arbitration may be recognised and enforced; or
    
    *   _(d)_ The composition of the arbitral authority or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties, or, failing such agreement, was not in accordance with the law of the country where the arbitration took place; or
    
    *   _(e)_ The award has not yet become binding on the parties, or has been set aside or suspended by a competent authority of the country in which, or under the law of which, that award was made.
    
    

*   2\. Recognition and enforcement of an arbitral award may also be refused if the competent authority in the country where recognition and enforcement is sought finds that:
        
    *   _(a)_ The subject matter of the difference is not capable of settlement by arbitration under the law of that country; or
    
    *   _(b)_ The recognition or enforcement of the award would be contrary to the public policy of that country.
    
    

### Article VI

If an application for the setting aside or suspension of the award has been made to a competent authority referred to in article V(1)(e), the authority before which the award is sought to be relied upon may, if it considers it proper, adjourn the decision on the enforcement of the award and may also, on the application of the party claiming enforcement of the award, order the other party to give suitable security.

### Article VII
    
*   1\. The provisions of the present Convention shall not affect the validity of multilateral or bilateral agreements concerning the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards entered into by the Contracting States nor deprive any interested party of any right he may have to avail himself of an arbitral award in the manner and to the extent allowed by the law or the treaties of the country where such award is sought to be relied upon.

*   3\.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Arbitration Act 1996\. It incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 January 2011, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][129] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][130] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][131] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][132] and [17E][133] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   "omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   "typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   "layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   "indentation
        *   "position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   "format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   "format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   "position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   "punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   "Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   "case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   "format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   "small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   "schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   "running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   "format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
