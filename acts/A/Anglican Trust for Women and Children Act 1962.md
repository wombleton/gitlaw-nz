An Act to declare the trusts upon which certain real and personal property is now held by The Orphan Home Trust Board, a Trust Board incorporated under the provisions of the Religious, Charitable, and Educational Trust Boards Incorporation Act 1884 and having its office at Shortland Street in the City of Auckland (hereinafter referred to as the Board), and to declare the trusts upon which real and personal property hereafter vested in or acquired by the Board is to be held, and to confer certain necessary powers upon the Board, and to provide a constitution and rules for the Board, and to provide for other incidental matters to facilitate the management and administration of such real and personal property vested in or acquired by the Board, and to validate a change of name of the Board
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    Whereas, in or about the year 1860, an orphanage was established in the City of Auckland by certain persons being members of the Church of England for the care of orphans and destitute children: And whereas the members for the time being of the Board of such orphanage caused themselves to be incorporated on 10 November 1888, under the name of The Orphan Home Trust Board under the provisions of the Religious, Charitable, and Educational Trust Boards Incorporation Act 1884, and such incorporation was duly recorded in the Supreme Court of New Zealand at Auckland on 10 November 1888 aforesaid: And whereas the incorporation of the Board was not, as far as can be ascertained by search and inquiry, preceded by the execution of a declaration of trust specifically declaring the trusts, powers, and authorities of the incorporating trustees or of the Board, and there do not exist, so far as diligent search and inquiry can ascertain, any declared trusts regarding the lands and other assets vested in the Board on its incorporation, or any declared trusts in respect of the greater portion of the lands and other assets acquired by and vested in the Board subsequently to its incorporation: And whereas, since such incorporation, extensive funds and properties both real and personal have been placed at the disposal of the Board and have been employed by it in furtherance of its work and in the purchase of properties for use in such work, or invested for the purpose of providing funds for such work: And whereas, in view of the inability to locate or discover any declaration of trust declaring the trusts upon which the Board now holds the real and personal property vested in it and the trusts upon which property real and personal subsequently acquired by or vested in the Board is to be held, it is desirable that the said trusts be declared, that certain necessary provisions be made for the constitution of the Board, that appointment of the existing members of the Board be confirmed, that provision be made for the appointment of successive members, that certain essential and necessary powers be conferred upon the Board, and that other administrative matters be defined: And whereas the name The Orphan Home Trust Board is not now a suitable name for the Board in that the work of the Board is not and has not for some years been confined to the control of a single institution for the care of orphans, but embraces the control of several institutions and considerable welfare and charitable work apart from such institutions among destitute or needy children who for the most part are not orphans: And whereas the Board has, by resolution of a duly constituted meeting, resolved to change the name of the said Board to Church of England Children's Trust and it is accordingly desirable to make provision to remove any doubt that may arise as to the validity of such change of name and to facilitate dealings with the assets of the Board under its new name.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Anglican Trust for Women and Children Act 1962\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 3 October 1975, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][28] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][29] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][1] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][30] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][1] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][31] and [17E][32] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][1] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][1] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   "omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   "typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   "layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   "indentation
        *   "position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   "format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   "format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   "position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   "punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   "Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   "case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   "format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   "small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   "schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   "running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
