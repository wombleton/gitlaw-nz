##### 4A Scheme of Act
    
*   (1) This Act aims to achieve its purpose by providing that no agricultural compound may be used (including imported, manufactured, or sold) in New Zealand unless that use is authorised by or under this Act.
    
    (2) The 2 main mechanisms for authorising use of an agricultural compound are---
        
    *   (a) an assessment of the compound, and its registration for use subject to specifically imposed conditions:
    
    *   (b) an exemption from the requirement to register the compound, so long as any specified conditions for exemption are met.
    
    (3) A range of conditions may be imposed to manage the risks associated with agricultural compounds. These conditions may relate to substances, products, systems, or people's behaviour, and may be imposed---
        
    *   (a) directly by the Director-General when an agricultural compound is registered or exempted from the requirement to be registered; or
    
    *   (b) generally, by regulations.
    
    (4) The Director-General may also issue notices that set out the technical detail of how compliance with conditions imposed by regulations can be achieved.
    
    (5) This Act, by its subject matter, has a relationship with other Acts such as the [Animal Products Act 1999][236], the [Food Act 1981][237], the [Wine Act 2003][238], the [Animal Welfare Act 1999][239], the [Biosecurity Act 1993][226], the [Medicines Act 1981][240], and the [Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1986][227]. Generally, the outcomes for which this Act regulates are those set under the other related Acts. For example:
        
    *   (a) maximum residue limits for food products are set under the [Food Act 1981][237]; while
    
    *   (b) this Act assesses and controls agricultural compounds to ensure the Food Act residue limit is not breached.

#### Cost recovery
    
*   Heading: inserted, on 18 October 2007, by [section 51][345] of the Agricultural Compounds and Veterinary Medicines Amendment Act 2007 (2007 No 93).

##### 81 Principles of cost recovery
    
*   (1) The Minister and the Director-General must take all reasonable steps to ensure that the direct and indirect costs of administering this Act that are not provided for by money appropriated by Parliament for the purpose are recovered under this section and [sections 81A to 83][162] (referred to in this section and those sections as the _cost recovery sections_), whether by way of fees, levies, or otherwise.
    
    (2) In determining the most appropriate method of cost recovery under [section 81A][162], and its level, in any particular case or class of cases of agricultural compound, business, person, or other matter, the Minister and Director-General must have regard, as far as is reasonably practicable, to the following criteria:
        
    *   (a) equity, in that funding for a particular function, power, or service, or a particular class of function, powers, or services, should generally, and to the extent practicable, be sourced from the users or beneficiaries of the relevant function, power, or service at a level commensurate with their use or benefit from the function, power, or service:
    
    *   (b) efficiency, in that costs should generally be allocated and recovered in order to ensure that maximum benefits are delivered at minimum cost:
    
    *   (c) justifiability, in that costs should be collected only to meet the reasonable costs (including indirect costs) for the provision or exercise of the relevant function, power, or service:
    
    *   (d) transparency, in that costs should be identified and allocated as closely as practicable in relation to tangible service provision for the recovery period in which the service is provided.
    
    (3) Costs should not be recovered under the cost recovery sections unless there has been appropriate consultation with affected parties and relevant industry organisations in accordance with [section 78][157], and the parties involved have been given sufficient time and information to make an informed contribution.
    
    (4) Nothing in subsection (3) or [section 78][157] or [81C][164] requires consultation in relation to specific fees or charges, or the specific levels of fees or charges, so long as the fees or charges set are reasonably within the purview of any general consultation or any consultation carried out for the purposes of section 78, and a failure to comply with subsection (3) does not affect the validity of any regulations made for the purposes of these cost recovery sections.
    
    (5) Nothing in this section requires a strict apportionment of the costs to be recovered for a particular function or service based on usage; and, without limiting the way in which fees or charges may be set, a fee or charge may be set at a level or in a way that---
        
    *   (a) is determined by calculations that involve an averaging of costs or potential costs:
    
    *   (b) takes into account costs or potential costs of services that are not directly to be provided to the person who pays the fee or charge but which are an indirect or potential cost arising from the delivery of the service in question to a class of persons or all persons who use the service.
    
    Section 81: substituted, on 18 October 2007, by [section 51][345] of the Agricultural Compounds and Veterinary Medicines Amendment Act 2007 (2007 No 93).

##### 81A Methods of cost recovery
    
*   The methods by which costs may be recovered under the cost recovery sections are as follows:
        
    *   (a) fixed fees or charges:
    
    *   (b) fees or charges based on a scale or formula or at a rate determined on an hourly or other unit basis:
    
    *   (c) use of a formula or other method of calculation for fixing fees and charges:
    
    *   (d) the recovery by way of fee or charge of actual and reasonable costs expended in, or associated with, the performance of a service or function:
    
    *   (e) estimated fees or charges, or fees or charges based on estimated costs, paid before the provision of the service or function, followed by reconciliation and an appropriate further payment or refund after provision of the service or function:
    
    *   (f) refundable or non-refundable deposits paid before provision of the service or performance of the function:
    
    *   (g) fees or charges imposed on users of services or third parties:
    
    *   (h) levies:
    
    *   (i) any combination of the above.

    *   (b) except as the regulations may otherwise provide, apply in that year and all subsequent years until revoked or replaced.
    
    (2) Subsection (1) does not prevent the alteration or setting during any financial year of a fee, charge, or levy payable in that year if either---
        
    *   (a) the fee, charge, or levy is reduced, removed, or restated without substantive alteration; or
    
    *   (b) in the case of an increase or a new fee, charge, or levy,---
            
        *   (i) appropriate consultation in accordance with [section 78][157] has been carried out with persons or representatives of persons substantially affected by the alteration or setting; and
        
        *   (ii) the Minister is satisfied that those persons, or their representatives, agree or do not substantially disagree with the alteration or setting.
        
        
    
    (3) Subsection (1) does not prevent the amendment of any regulation setting a fee, charge, or levy if any substantive alteration effected by the amendment is for the purpose of correcting an error.
    
    (4) Recovery may be made in any financial year of any shortfall in cost recovery for any of the preceding 4 financial years, and allowance may be made for any over-recovery of costs in those years (including any estimated shortfall or over-recovery for the immediately preceding financial year).

*   (1) The Minister must cause to be reviewed, at least once in every 3-year period occurring since the original setting of, or latest change to, the levels and methods of cost recovery in relation to any class of agricultural compound, business, person, or other matter, the levels and methods of cost recovery in the relevant area that are likely to be appropriate for the following financial year or years.
    
    (2) The Minister must ensure that appropriate consultation in accordance with [section 78][157] takes place in relation to any such review.
    
    (3) A review may make provision for recovery in any relevant financial year of any shortfall in cost recovery for any of the preceding 4 financial years, or make allowance for any over-recovery of costs in those years (including any estimated shortfall or over-recovery for the immediately preceding financial year).
    
    (4) Subsection (1) does not require all areas of cost recovery to be reviewed at the same time, nor does it impose any time limit on the making of regulations to implement the results of a review.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Agricultural Compounds and Veterinary Medicines Act 1997\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 October 2012, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][367] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][368] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][369] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][370] and [17E][371] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.

    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
