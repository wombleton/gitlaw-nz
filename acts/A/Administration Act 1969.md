    provided that, subject to the provisions of subsection (2), where the deceased died wholly intestate as to his or her estate, administration shall be granted to some 1 or more persons beneficially interested in the estate of the deceased, if they make an application for the purpose.
    
    (2) Where by reason of the insolvency of the estate or other special circumstances the court thinks it necessary or expedient to do so, it may---
        
    *   (a) grant administration to such person or persons as it thinks expedient notwithstanding that some other person is appointed an executor or that, apart from this subsection, some other person would by law be entitled to a grant of administration:
    
    *   (b) grant probate to 1 or more of the executors appointed by a will, notwithstanding that some other person or persons may also be appointed as an executor or executors.

    (4) Before determining to exclude from any such grant any person who, apart from this section, would by law be entitled to, or be included in, the grant, and wishes to have, or to be so included in, the grant, the court shall have regard to his or her competency and solvency, his or her ability effectively to administer the estate, the rights of all persons interested in the estate, and any changes in circumstances between the making of the will (if any) and the time when the court is asked to make the grant.
    
    (5) The court may, in its discretion, make any grant of administration (other than the probate of a will) conditional upon the person to whom the grant is made giving such security as the court may require for the due collection, getting in, and administration of the estate of the deceased:
    
    provided that the court shall not require any trustee corporation, or any person obtaining administration to the use or for the benefit of the Sovereign, to give any such security.
    
    (6) The court shall not exercise its powers under subsection (5) unless it is satisfied that, in the special circumstances of the case, the imposition of the requirement of security would be expedient having regard to the following matters:
        
    *   (a) the value of the estate:
    
    *   (b) the financial position of the proposed administrator:
    
    *   (c) the extent of his or her interest (if any) in the estate:

    *   (f) such other matters as the court thinks relevant.
    
    (7) It shall not be necessary in any motion for a grant of administration, or in any affidavit filed in support of such motion, to include any information for the purposes only of subsections (5) and (6) unless the court in a particular case expressly requires that information to be supplied.

    (2) The court may, out of the estate of the deceased, grant to a temporary administrator appointed under this section such reasonable remuneration as the court thinks fit.
    
    Compare: Supreme Court of Judicature (Consolidation) Act 1925 s 163 (UK)

##### 8 Grant of special administration where administrator is out of New Zealand

Unless the court otherwise directs, every grant of special administration shall continue until the administrator to whom the grant is made is discharged or removed under [section 21][27].
    
    (2) While a grant of special administration of the estate of a deceased person remains in force the previously subsisting administration of that estate shall be deemed to be suspended, and the administrator thereunder shall not be liable for acts and things done by the administrator under the grant of special administration.
    
    (3) The court may, for the purpose of any legal proceedings to which the administrator under the special administration is a party, order the transfer into court of any money or securities belonging to the estate, and all persons shall obey any such order.
    
    (4) If the administrator capable of acting as such returns to and resides within the jurisdiction of the court while any legal proceedings to which a special administrator is a party are pending, the administrator who so returns may be made a party to the legal proceedings, and the court may order that the costs of and incidental to the special administration and the legal proceedings shall be paid by such person and out of such fund as it may specify.
    
    (5) Nothing in this section shall restrict [section 21][27].

##### 9 Administration during minority of executor
    
*   (1) Where a person who is sole executor of a will is at the date of the testator's death a minor who is not entitled to a grant of probate under subsection (3), administration with the will annexed may be granted to such person as the court thinks fit, until the minor becomes entitled to and obtains a grant of probate to him or her; and on his or her attaining full age or sooner becoming entitled to a grant of probate under that subsection and not before, probate of the will may be granted to him or her.
    
    (2) Where a testator by his or her will appoints a person who at his or her death is a minor who is not entitled to a grant of probate under subsection (3) to be an executor, the appointment shall not operate to transfer any interest in the estate of the deceased to the minor or to constitute him or her an administrator for any purpose, unless and until probate is granted to him or her under this section.
    
    (3) Where a testator by his or her will appoints a person who is a minor to be an executor, probate of the will may be granted to the person if, at the date of the grant,---

    *   (b) references in this Act to the intestate ""leaving no issue"" shall, subject to the provisions of this section, be construed as ""leaving no issue who attain an absolutely vested interest"":
    
    *   (c) references in this Act to the intestate ""leaving issue"" or ""leaving a child or other issue"" shall, subject to the provisions of this section, be construed as ""leaving issue who attain an absolutely vested interest"":
