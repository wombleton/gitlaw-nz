*   #### Preamble
    
    (1) The Affiliate (comprising the Iwi and Hapu of Te Arawa that are now affiliated to the Te Pumautanga o Te Arawa trust) traditionally operated as independent entities, coming together when prompted by common interests. Together they exercised customary interests within the approximately 1 150 000-acre area from the Bay of Plenty coast to the inland Rotorua lakes and into the interior to the Mamaku Ranges and Kaingaroa Forest. Other iwi and hapu also exercised customary interests within this area. The Affiliate engaged with the opportunities created by the arrival of Pakeha traders and missionaries in its rohe from the 1830s. By the late 1860s, however, few Pakeha had settled in the area, and the Affiliate still held almost all of its land in customary title:
    
    (2) The Crown introduced the Native Land Court (the _Court_) into the central North Island in 1867, without consulting with the Affiliate, to convert customary title into title derived from the Crown. Some of the Affiliate engaged with the Court to gain secure titles to assist leasing of land and secure their lands against claims from other groups. Others objected to the Court. The Crown received complaints about the cost of hearings, survey charges, and applications initiated without the consent of other owners:
    
    (3) From 1873, the Crown focused on the acquisition of Maori land to facilitate Pakeha settlement in the central North Island. The Crown was aware of widespread resistance to land sales among some of the Affiliate, and initially proposed to restrict negotiations mainly to the lease rather than the sale of land. By August 1874, the Crown had opened, but not completed, lease negotiations for almost 650 000 acres and purchase negotiations for almost 400 000 acres of land within the Affiliate area. In most cases it opened negotiations before the Court had determined owners. The Crown sought to secure land by making preliminary agreements with, and paying deposits to, sections of ""recognised owners"". In some cases this bound the recipients into negotiations before the purchase price or rent had been agreed. The Crown generally did not pay rent on land it negotiated to lease until title had been determined. Between 1873 and 1877, the Crown suspended the operation of the Court over much of the land in which the Affiliate had interests, which delayed the finalisation of most negotiations:
    
    (4) The Crown's attempts to lease or purchase land brought a variety of responses from the Affiliate. Some of the Affiliate entered negotiations because they wanted to derive an income from their land. Others expressed unhappiness at the Crown's approach and opposed negotiations. Some sought to maintain tribal control over land through tribal komiti (committees):
    
    (5) In the 1880s, the Court adjudicated over much of the land in the area over which the Affiliate exercised customary interests, including many of the blocks the Crown had brought under negotiation in the 1870s. Land was generally awarded in individual interests, and the Crown could partition out the interests it had purchased from owners without gaining the agreement of other owners of the land. This enabled those individuals to deal with the land without reference to their iwi and hapu, making the land more susceptible to partition, fragmentation, and alienation, and contributing to the erosion of the traditional tribal structures of the Affiliate, which were based on collective tribal and hapu custodianship of land. Attending Court hearings, sometimes considerable distances from their kainga (homes), was costly for the Affiliate:
    
    (6) During most of the 1870s--1890s, the Crown protected its negotiations from interference by using legislative provisions and proclamations to prevent private parties from negotiating for land over which it was negotiating. The Crown provided few reserves in lands purchased from the Affiliate during the 1870s--1890s. The combined effect of actions such as the use of payments for land before title was determined, aggressive purchase techniques employed on occasion by the Crown, and the use and implementation of monopoly powers over dealings in land meant that the Crown failed to actively protect the interests of the Affiliate in the land it wished to retain, leaving some of the Affiliate virtually landless:
    
    (7) By the late 1920s, many Maori owned small, fragmented, and uneconomic interests in a number of blocks throughout their rohe as a result of individualisation and partition of land interests. The Crown attempted to resolve this by introducing consolidation schemes and providing funds for development schemes to utilise land. Landowners' rights were significantly affected while their land was tied up in development schemes. The Affiliate placed land into over 25 development schemes between 1929 and the mid-1980s. By the early 1990s, most scheme lands in the Rotorua area had been released from Crown control. Some schemes were successful while others struggled to fulfil expectations:
    
    (8) The Crown acquired lands of particular significance to the Affiliate through public works and scenery preservation legislation. In the nineteenth century, land was compulsorily acquired for public works purposes, including roading and railway. In the twentieth century, land was taken for internal communications, electricity generation, scenic reserves, forest plantation, and an aerodrome. Compensation was generally paid for the taking of lands. However, some Affiliate lands were used for roading purposes without compensation. Over time, through purchases and public works takings, the Affiliate lost ownership of some important geothermal lands and wahi tapu. The loss of these lands has impeded the ability of the Affiliate to exercise control over its taonga and wahi tapu and maintain and foster spiritual connections with those ancestral lands.

##### 6 Acknowledgements and apology
    
*   [Sections 7][10] and [8][11] record the acknowledgements and the apology given by the Crown to the Affiliate in the deed of settlement.

##### 7 Text of acknowledgements
    
*   The text of the acknowledgements, as set out in the deed of settlement, is as follows:
    
    (1) The Crown acknowledges that it has failed to deal with the longstanding grievances of the Affiliate in an appropriate way and that recognition of the grievances of the Affiliate is long overdue.
    
    (2) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) it did not consult with the Affiliate on native land legislation prior to its enactment; and
    
    *   (b) the operation and impact of the native land laws, in particular the awarding of land to individuals and the enabling of individuals to deal with that land without reference to the iwi and hapu, made the lands of the Affiliate more susceptible to partition, fragmentation, and alienation. This contributed to the erosion of the traditional tribal structures of the Affiliate, which were based on collective tribal and hapu custodianship of land; and
    
    *   (c) it failed to take steps to adequately protect the traditional tribal structures of the Affiliate, and this had a prejudicial effect on the Affiliate and was a breach of the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles.
    
    (3) The Crown acknowledges that the combined effect of certain Crown actions meant that the Crown failed to actively protect the interests of the Affiliate in the land they wished to retain, and that this was a breach of the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles. The actions include---
        
    *   (a) the Crown's use of payments for land before title to the land was determined by the Native Land Court:
    
    *   (b) the aggressive purchase techniques employed on occasion by the Crown:
    
    *   (c) the Crown's use and implementation of its monopoly powers over dealings in the land of the Affiliate.
    
    (4) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) a large amount of Affiliate land has been alienated since 1840; and
    
    *   (b) the combined effect of the Crown's actions and omissions has left some of the Affiliate virtually landless; and
    
    *   (c) its failure to ensure that all members of the Affiliate were left with sufficient land for their present and future needs was a breach of the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles.
    
    (5) The Crown acknowledges that lands of particular significance to the Affiliate, including land at Te Ariki, Okere Falls, and lands with geothermal surface features at Orakei Korako and Rotorua Airport, were taken under public works legislation. The Crown acknowledges that these takings have impeded the ability of the Affiliate to exercise control over its taonga and wahi tapu and maintain and foster spiritual connections with those ancestral lands. This has resulted in a sense of grievance among the Affiliate that still exists today.
    
    (6) The Crown acknowledges---
        
    *   (a) the generosity of the Affiliate in gifting land containing scenic sites to the nation; and
    
    *   (b) that, in the case of land gifted by Ngati Pikiao for the Rotoiti Scenic Reserve and at the time of gifting, the Crown had been undertaking measures to compulsorily acquire a greater area of land under the Scenery Preservation Act 1908\.
    
    (7) The Crown acknowledges that the Affiliate considers the geothermal resource a taonga. The Crown also acknowledges that the following matters have caused a sense of grievance within the Affiliate that is still held today:
        
    *   (a) the passing of the Geothermal Energy Act 1953; and
    
    *   (b) the loss of lands containing geothermal features for public works purposes.
    
    (8) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) Affiliate expectations of an ongoing and mutually beneficial relationship with the Crown were not always realised; and
    
    *   (b) twentieth-century land development did not always provide the economic opportunities and benefits that the Affiliate expected.
    
    (9) The Crown acknowledges that the Affiliate has been loyal to the Crown in honouring its obligations and responsibilities under the Treaty of Waitangi, especially, but not exclusively, in war service overseas by some of its members. The Crown pays tribute to the contribution made by the Affiliate to the defence of the nation.

##### 8 Text of apology
    
*   The text of the apology, as set out in the deed of settlement, is as follows:
    
    (1) The Crown recognises the efforts and struggles of the ancestors of the Affiliate in pursuit of their claims for redress, justice, and compensation and makes this apology to the members of the Affiliate, to their ancestors, and to their descendants.
    
    (2) The Crown profoundly regrets and unreservedly apologises to the Affiliate for the breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles, acknowledged in [section 7][10].
    
    (3) The Crown profoundly regrets and unreservedly apologises for the cumulative effect of its actions over the generations, which have undermined tribal structures and had a damaging impact on the landholdings and development of the Affiliate.
    
    (4) Accordingly, the Crown seeks to atone for these wrongs and assist the process of healing with this settlement, and looks forward to building a relationship of mutual trust and co-operation with the Affiliate.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Affiliate Te Arawa Iwi and Hapu Claims Settlement Act 2008\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 18 November 2010, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][264] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][265] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/legislation/reprints.shtml or Part 8 of the _Tables of Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations, and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][266] and [17E][267] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
