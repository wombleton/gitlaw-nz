An Act to vest in the Board of Trustees hereinafter mentioned the Freehold and Leasehold Lands belonging to certain of the Churches known as the Associated Churches of Christ in New Zealand, the said Lands and the Churches to which they belong being set forth and described in Schedule [1][33] hereto; to vest in the said Board the Church Property described in Schedule [2][34] hereto, and to provide a Simple Form of Procedure whereby any others of the said Associated Churches of Christ may vest their Freehold or Leasehold Properties in the said Board, subject to the Trusts, Powers, and Authorities hereinafter defined and set forth; also to rescind all other Trusts existing in respect of or relating to the Property of any of the said Associated Churches of Christ now or hereafter vested in the said Board, and to set forth the Trusts, Powers, and Authorities upon and subject to which all Church Properties hereby or hereafter to be vested in the said Board shall be held and managed; also to define and set forth the Powers and Authorities of the said Board with relation to certain Funds of the said Associated Churches of Christ now or hereafter vested in the said Board and the Trusts relating thereto, and also to validate the Transfer or Conveyance to the said Board of all Properties hitherto transferred or conveyed to the same.
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    WHEREAS in the Dominion of New Zealand certain persons are members (as defined by section two of this Act) of Churches at various places in the said Dominion, which said Churches are affiliated to the religious body known as the Associated Churches of Christ in New Zealand (hereinafter referred to as **the body**): And whereas at a duly convened Conference of delegates of the said Churches held at South Dunedin on the eighteenth day of April, nineteen hundred and twenty-four, a Board of Trustees consisting of certain members of the said Churches was set up, to the intent that the said Board should hold as Trustees the lands of such of the said Churches as were desirous of vesting the same in the said Board, and also all real and personal property to be vested in the said Board for Church extension purposes: And whereas the said Board was duly incorporated under the Religious, Charitable, and Educational Trusts Act 1908: And whereas the said Board is known as the Church Extension and Property Trust Board of Associated Churches of Christ in New Zealand: And whereas by a certain deed-poll or declaration of trust bearing date the twentyninth day of January, nineteen hundred and twenty-five, the said Board attempted to define (a) the trusts upon and subject to which moneys raised or received by it, or real and personal property received, held, purchased, or acquired by it, for Church extension purposes were to be held, managed, lent, or expended, and the powers of the said Board relative thereto, and (b) the trusts upon and subject to which the said Board would hold all real or personal property held by it, either on behalf of any individual Church of Christ affiliating with the body or on behalf of the body itself, or on behalf of any society, club, or other organization connected with the body or any Church affiliated therewith, and the powers relating thereto: And whereas the Churches named in Schedule [1][33] hereto have transferred their respective properties (as described in column three of the said Schedule) to the said Board upon the trusts set forth in the said declaration of trust: And whereas doubts have arisen as to the ability of the said Board to legally hold the properties vested therein or other properties sought to be vested therein, and it is desirable that such doubts should be removed by legislative enactment: And whereas certain other Churches affiliated with the said body are desirous of vesting their respective properties in the said Board, subject to the trusts hereinafter defined, but are precluded from doing so by reason of the said properties being held under existing trusts, or are unable to do so without incurring the expense of first appointing new Trustees in place of those who have died, as well as other legal expenses: And whereas in the case of the property described in Schedule [2][34] hereto the Trustees thereof are (so far as is known) all deceased, and there is no person duly authorized to apply to the said Board to take over the said property: And whereas it is desirable that in this case the disabilities hereinbefore mentioned should be removed, and that a simple and ready means should be provided whereby the said property may be vested in the said Board upon the trusts and subject to the powers and authorities hereinafter defined and set forth:

BE IT THEREFORE ENACTED by the General Assembly of New Zealand in Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:---

##### 7 Empowering the Board to accept trusteeship of any property upon trusts created by will or otherwise
    
*   The Board is empowered to hold and administer, as Trustees for Church purposes, property of any description which may be given, devised, or bequeathed to it by will, or assigned, transferred, or conveyed to it by any person or body of persons, body corporate, company, or firm, upon the trusts annexed thereto by the person or body of persons, body corporate, company, or firm by whom or by which the said property is given, devised, bequeathed, assigned, transferred, or conveyed to the Board:
    
    Provided, however, that the Board shall not be bound to accept the trusteeship of any property unless in its uncontrolled discretion it deems it expedient so to do.

##### 8 Directing trustees of any real property held on behalf of the Associated Churches of Christ in New Zealand to convey same to the Board if so decided by Conference
    
*   If at any Conference of delegates representing Churches affiliated to the body not less than two-thirds of the delegates present vote in favour of a motion requesting the trustees of any real property held by them on behalf of the body (as such) to transfer or convey the same to the Board, the trustees shall forthwith transfer or convey the said property to the Board subject to the trusts upon and subject to which the same is already held by them, and in the absence of any defined trusts the Board shall hold the same subject to the wishes and directions of the body as expressed by resolution from time to time in Conference.

        Provided always that under no circumstances shall the Board be called upon to execute a transfer or lease of the said land, or otherwise alienate the same, to any other religious body or any other organization, or to any person or persons or body corporate as agents or trustees for any other religious body or organization, except in the ordinary course of dealing, and not on account of any change in the religious beliefs or tenets of the members of the said Church or any of them or otherwise howsoever, or to any majority of the members of any Church seceding from the Associated Churches of Christ and retaining the name of Church of Christ while holding tenets or doctrines which on submission to the Associated Churches of Christ in Conference assembled shall be declared by a majority resolution to be at variance with the tenets and doctrines held by the body, the intention being that the said land (or if sold the proceeds thereof or any investment representing the same, or if leased the income and profits thereof) shall remain and be held for all time for and on behalf of the aforesaid body known as the Associated Churches of Christ in New Zealand:
    
    *   (b) As to the property described in Schedule [2][34] hereto, or the property or properties of any Church or Churches that may hereafter become defunct or be disbanded (from whatever cause), or that may secede from the body, upon trust to sell, mortgage, exchange, lease, and accept surrenders of leases of the said land and premises, upon or for such term or terms and upon and subject to such conditions as the Board may think fit; and all moneys derived from such dealings, after deducting all legal and other expenses properly incurred in the management and realization of the said lands or incidental thereto, shall fall into and form part of the Church Extension Fund:
        
        Provided, however, that no Church shall be deemed to have become defunct, or to have disbanded, or to have seceded from the body, unless and until it has been so decided by a resolution duly carried by a bare-majority vote of delegates at a duly-convened Conference of the body pursuant to a notice of motion circulated amongst the Churches affiliated to the body not less than three months prior to the date of commencement of the said Conference:
        
        Provided, further, that on a resolution being carried as aforesaid decreeing that a Church has seceded from the body such resolution shall be conveyed by registered post to the Secretary or other responsible officer for the time being of the Church so deemed to have seceded, accompanied by a notice requiring the said Church within three calendar months from the date hereof to vacate, deliver up possession of, and surrender to the Board all property, both real and personal, whatsoever belonging to the said Church; and upon the expiration of the said notice the said Church shall _ipso facto_ be divested of all its estate or interest in the said real and personal property, which shall thenceforth be held by the Board subject to the trusts, powers, and authorities hereinbefore provided.
