An Act to supplement the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Act 1970 of the Parliament of the United Kingdom by making the transfer of the undertaking of Australia and New Zealand Bank Limited to Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited fully effective in New Zealand
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    Whereas Australia and New Zealand Bank Limited (hereinafter referred to as the **existing bank**), Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (hereinafter referred to as the **Bank**), and The English, Scottish and Australian Bank, Limited are incorporated in England and are companies within the meaning of the Companies Acts 1948 to 1967 of the Parliament of the United Kingdom: 
    
    And whereas the existing bank carries on the business of banking in New Zealand and elsewhere: 
    
    And whereas by a scheme of arrangement sanctioned under section 206 of the Companies Act 1948 of the Parliament of the United Kingdom and which took effect on 23 June 1969, the existing bank and The English, Scottish and Australian Bank, Limited became wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Bank: 
    
    And whereas the said scheme of arrangement was proposed with a view to the merger of the undertakings of the existing bank and The English, Scottish and Australian Bank, Limited: 
    
    And whereas by the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Act 1970 of the Parliament of the United Kingdom provision is made (_inter alia_) for the transfer to and vesting in the Bank of the undertakings of the existing bank and The English, Scottish and Australian Bank, Limited so that such transfer and vesting may be effected economically and without interference with the conduct and continuity of the business of banking: 
    
    And whereas portions of those undertakings cannot be vested in the Bank by virtue of the said Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom because transfers of those portions are governed otherwise than by a law of a part of the United Kingdom: 
    
    And whereas legislation is the only means by which the transfer to the Bank of the portion of the undertaking of the existing bank which is governed by the laws of New Zealand can be effected economically and without interference with the conduct and continuity of the business of banking:
    
    And whereas the said Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom contains (_inter alia_) the provisions set forth in the [Schedule][18].

    *   (a) any enactment other than an enactment in this Act; or
    
    *   (b) any document whensoever made or executed;
    
    contains any reference express or implied to an existing bank such reference shall, on and after the appointed day and except where the context otherwise requires, be read, construed, and have effect as a reference to the Bank:
    
    provided that this subsection shall not apply to any reference to an existing bank in relation to an excluded asset in an enactment or document.
    
    (2) Notwithstanding anything in the preceding subsection where in pursuance thereof a reference to an existing bank in any document constituting or relating to any pension scheme, provident fund or officers' guarantee fund of that existing bank in force immediately before the appointed day is to be read, construed and have effect as a reference to the Bank, for the purpose of ascertaining and calculating the right to benefit thereunder, service or employment with that existing bank prior to the appointed day shall be taken into account as if it were service or employment with the Bank, but the coming into force of this section shall not of itself give rise to any claim to benefit under any such scheme or fund or operate to cause a person to become a member of another pension scheme, provident fund or officers' guarantee fund.
    
    (3) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) of this section, where by any order of the court or by any trust deed, settlement, covenant or agreement or where by any will, whether made or executed before, on or after the appointed day, an existing bank (whether alone or with any other person) was or is granted letters of administration or appointed trustee, executor, guardian or in any other fiduciary capacity, such order, trust deed, settlement, covenant, agreement or will shall not fail by reason of any thing in this Act but shall as from the appointed day be read and construed and have effect as if for any reference therein to that existing bank there was substituted a reference to the Bank.
    
    (4) Nothing in this Act shall exempt the Bank from the provisions of any enactment relating to companies carrying on the business of banking.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Act 1970\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 April 1987, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][30] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][31] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][32] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][33] and [17E][34] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
