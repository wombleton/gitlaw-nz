  * (a) the employer so requests; and

  * (c) must, after the end of the 2009--10 tax year, prescribe the levies at the same rate for employers and self-employed persons classified in the same industry or risk class.

(5) The Corporation must decide which industry or risk class is appropriate in relation to any employer or self-employed person by whom a levy is payable, and [section 239][300] applies if the classes defined by the regulations do not specifically cover a particular activity.

(6) The Corporation must separately account for the amounts---
  * (a) collected from each industry or risk class under [sections 168][209], [168B][211], and [211][265]; and

(7) If costs relating to a particular claim are attributable to more than 1 industry or risk class, the Corporation must apportion those costs in a way that reasonably represents the relative costs to each of those industry or risk classes.

  * (b) information about the nature and severity of injuries to employees in that industry or risk class:
  * (c) information about trends in relation to work-related personal injuries in that industry or risk class:
  * (d) the number, nature, and severity of claims for cover accepted for work-related personal injuries by employees of that employer:
  * (e) any trends or patterns in the work-related personal injuries suffered by employees of that employer, such as a repetition of claims by particular employees or types of employee, or a repetition of particular types of injury:
  * (f) any audit previously undertaken of the employer's safety management practices:
  * (g) any international information that is relevant to the New Zealand situation.

##### 179 Process for Corporation to decide whether to require audit

* (1) The process in this section is initiated by the Corporation giving the employer a notice stating---
  * (a) that the Corporation is satisfied of the matter specified in [section 178(1)][224]; and
  * (b) the Corporation's reasons for its statement under paragraph (a); and
  * (c) that the purpose of the process is to decide whether or not the employer's safety management practices should be audited under [section 180][226]; and
  * (d) that the Corporation and employer are required to enter into a dialogue about the standard of the employer's safety management practices; and
  * (e) that failure to reach the standard required by the audit or to allow the audit to take place may result in an upwards adjustment of the employer's levies.

(2) After the notice is given, the Corporation and employer must enter into a dialogue about the standard of the employer's safety management practices.

(3) As part of the dialogue, consideration must be given to whether---
  * (a) the employer should initiate a self-audit of its safety management practices:
  * (b) the Corporation should assist in such an audit:
  * (c) the Corporation should assist the employer to understand the need to improve, and the ways to improve, the employer's safety management practices.

(4) As part of the dialogue, the Corporation must give the employer a reasonable opportunity to explain and comment on the health and safety situation in the employer's workplace.

(5) When the Corporation and the employer have concluded the dialogue, the Corporation must---
  * (a) decide, on the basis of information it has gathered, whether the employer's safety management practices should be audited under [section 180][226]; and
  * (b) notify the employer of the decision.

##### 180 Effect of audit or refusal to allow audit

* (1) An audit allowed by an employer must be conducted in accordance with a tool approved by the Minister under [section 175(4)][221], which tool may be specially designed for the purposes of this section.

(2) If the employer refuses to allow an audit to take place, or the audit cannot be completed in a reasonable time because the employer fails to participate or because of the way in which the employer participates in the audit, the Corporation may adjust the employer's levies upwards without the audit being completed.

(3) If the employer reaches the standard required by the audit tool, the Corporation must not adjust the employer's levies upwards.

(4) If the employer fails to reach the standard required by the audit tool, the Corporation must adjust the employer's levies upwards in accordance with regulations made for the purposes of [section 175][221].

(5) To avoid doubt, if an employer whose levies have been adjusted upwards subsequently does reach the standard required by the audit tool and the levies are to be re-adjusted, the levies must be adjusted back to the standard rate for an employer in that industry or risk class.

> is the number of full or part weeks during which the claimant earned those earnings as an employee in the 4 weeks immediately before his or her incapacity commenced.

(2) This subclause applies to any weekly period of incapacity after the 4 weeks described in subclause (1). The claimant's weekly earnings for any such weekly period are calculated using the following formula:

    * (iii) those earnings ceased before the commencement of the claimant's incapacity:
  * (d) any earnings in respect of any period under paragraph (a), (b), or (c).

(4) In item b of the formula set out in subclause (2), the expression 52 is adjusted by deducting from it any number of weekly periods that subclause (3)(a), (b), or (c) applies to.

(5) For the purposes of subclause (3)(c), the Corporation may determine the number of weeks that fairly and reasonably represent the period during which the claimant received earnings as a self-employed person or as a shareholder-employee.

  * (b) 3 months have passed after the incapacity commenced.

(4) If the claimant's income tax return for the relevant year remains unavailable at the end of the 3-month period in subclause (3)(b), the Corporation can pay weekly compensation only as an advance under [section 131][163].

(5) If the Corporation---
  * (a) applies subclause (3); and
  * (b) pays weekly compensation; and
  * (c) subsequently finds that the weekly compensation it paid is greater than that it would have paid if the claimant's income tax return for the relevant year had been available,---

(4) Such a claimant is entitled to weekly compensation for 24 months from the date of entitlement to the compensation.

(5) However, the claimant's entitlement to the compensation is dependent on his or her making an election to be entitled, after reaching New Zealand superannuation qualification age, to the compensation, rather than to New Zealand superannuation.

(6) Subclauses (7) and (8) apply to a claimant who first becomes entitled to weekly compensation---
  * (a) within 12 months before reaching New Zealand superannuation qualification age; or
  * (b) on or after reaching New Zealand superannuation qualification age.

(7) Such a claimant is entitled to the weekly compensation for a period of 12 months following the later of---
  * (a) the date of reaching New Zealand superannuation qualification age; or
  * (b) the date of entitlement to weekly compensation.

(8) The claimant is then entitled to the weekly compensation for the next 12 months, if he or she makes an election to be entitled, during those 12 months, to the compensation, rather than to New Zealand superannuation.

(9) Nothing in this clause entitles a claimant to weekly compensation if he or she is not otherwise entitled to it under this schedule.

#### Transitional provisions for other matters

* To avoid doubt, this Act applies to disentitle a claimant for a wilfully self-inflicted personal injury, death, or suicide described in section 119 of the principal Act (as inserted by this Act) only if the personal injury was suffered or, as the case may be, the death or suicide occurred on or after the commencement of this section.

##### 54 Transitional provision for disentitlement for certain imprisoned offenders

* (1) To avoid doubt, this Act applies to disentitle a claimant who suffers a personal injury in the circumstances described in section 122 of the principal Act (as substituted by this Act) only if the personal injury was suffered on or after the commencement of this section.

(2) To avoid doubt, despite the amendment of section 122 of the principal Act by section 13 of this Act, section 122 of the principal Act (as it read immediately before the commencement of this section) continues to apply to a claimant who, before the commencement of this section, suffered a personal injury in the circumstances described in section 122 (as it so read).

##### 55 Claims for personal injury including hearing loss that have been lodged but not decided

* (1) This section applies if, before the commencement of this section,---
  * (a) a person has suffered a personal injury that includes any degree of hearing loss that is less than 6% of binaural hearing loss caused by a personal injury described in section 20(2) of the principal Act; and
  * (b) he or she has lodged a claim with the Accident Compensation Corporation under section 48 of the principal Act in respect of the personal injury; and
  * (c) the Corporation has not made a decision on the claim.

(2) On or after the commencement of this section, the Corporation must make a decision on the claim in all respects as if section 8 of this Act had not been enacted.

##### 56 Claims for work-related gradual process, disease, or infection that have been lodged but not decided

* (1) This section applies if, before the commencement of this section,---
  * (a) a person has suffered a personal injury caused by a work-related gradual process, disease, or infection; and
  * (b) he or she has lodged a claim with the Accident Compensation Corporation under section 48 of the principal Act in respect of the personal injury; and
  * (c) the Corporation has not made a decision on the claim.

(2) On or after the commencement of this section, the Corporation must make a decision on the claim in all respects as if section 9 of this Act had not been enacted.

##### 57 Assessment of vocational independence

* An assessment of a claimant's vocational independence that has been commenced, but not determined, before the commencement of this section must, on or after that commencement, be considered and determined in all respects as if sections 6(2), 11, and 47 (to the extent that it relates to clause 25 of Schedule 1 of the principal Act) of this Act had not been enacted.

##### 58 Calculations of weekly earnings for weekly compensation

* To avoid doubt, sections 223(3)(c)(i) and clauses 33, 34, 35, 36, 38, 39, 41, and 42 of Schedule 1 of the principal Act (as amended by this Act) apply to the calculation of weekly earnings for the purposes of weekly compensation that is payable in respect of a period of incapacity that commences only on or after the commencement of this section.

##### 59 Calculations of weekly compensation for loss of potential earning capacity

* (1) This section applies to---
  * (a) a claimant who is incapacitated before the commencement of this section, but who is not entitled to weekly compensation for loss of potential earning capacity immediately before that commencement:
  * (b) a claimant who is incapacitated only on or after the commencement of this section.

(2) To avoid doubt, clause 47 of Schedule 1 of the principal Act (as amended by this Act) applies to the calculation of weekly compensation for loss of potential earning capacity in respect of a claimant to whom this section applies.

##### 60 Special provision for claimant already entitled to receive weekly compensation for loss of potential earning capacity

* (1) This section applies to a claimant who is incapacitated before the commencement of this section and who is entitled to weekly compensation for loss of potential earning capacity immediately before that commencement.

(2) The weekly compensation payable to the claimant is the amount of weekly compensation to which the claimant was entitled immediately before the commencement of this section.

(3) However, if the calculation of weekly compensation for loss of potential earning capacity in respect of the claimant is, but for subsection (2) and section 59, more favourable to the claimant under clause 47(4) of Schedule 1 of the principal Act (as amended by this Act), then clause 47(4) applies despite subsection (2) and section 59\.

##### 61 Abatement of weekly compensation

* To avoid doubt, clause 49 of Schedule 1 of the principal Act (as amended by this Act) applies to the abatement of a claimant's weekly compensation in accordance with that clause and clause 51 of Schedule 1 of the principal Act in respect of a period of incapacity that commences only on or after the commencement of this section.

##### 62 Members of ministerial advisory panels not entitled to compensation

* (1) Nothing in this Act entitles a member of the ministerial advisory panel referred to in section 31 or 291 of the principal Act to any compensation in respect of the repeal of those sections and the removal of the panel, or for any fees or allowances that would otherwise be payable for the remainder of the term of an appointment affected by the repeals.
