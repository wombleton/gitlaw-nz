Text of Convention

[s 2][3]

### Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States

##### Preamble

The Contracting States

_Considering_ the need for international co-operation for economic development, and the role of private international investment therein;

_Bearing in mind_ the possibility that from time to time disputes may arise in connection with such investment between Contracting States and nationals of other Contracting States;

_Recognizing_ that while such disputes would usually be subject to national legal processes, international methods of settlement may be appropriate in certain cases;

_Attaching particular importance_ to the availability of facilities for international conciliation or arbitration to which Contracting States and nationals of other Contracting States may submit such disputes if they so desire;

_Desiring_ to establish such facilities under the auspices of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development;

_Recognizing_ that mutual consent by the parties to submit such disputes to conciliation or to arbitration through such facilities constitutes a binding agreement which requires in particular that due consideration be given to any recommendation of conciliators, and that any arbitral award be complied with; and

_Declaring_ that no Contracting State shall by the mere fact of its ratification, acceptance or approval of this Convention and without its consent be deemed to be under any obligation to submit any particular dispute to conciliation or arbitration,

_Have agreed_ as follows:

Jurisdiction of the Centre

#### Article 25
    
*   (1) The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre.

    *   (_a_) any natural person who had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration as well as on the date on which the request was registered pursuant to paragraph (3) of Article 28 or paragraph (3) of Article 36, but does not include any person who on either date also had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute; and

#### Article 26

Consent of the parties to arbitration under this Convention shall, unless otherwise stated, be deemed consent to such arbitration to the exclusion of any other remedy.

The Committee shall have the authority to annul the award or any part thereof on any of the grounds set forth in paragraph (1).

*   (4) The provisions of Articles 41--45, 48, 49, 53 and 54, and of Chapters VI and VII shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ to proceedings before the Committee.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Arbitration (International Investment Disputes) Act 1979\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 15 November 2000, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][23] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][24] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][25] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][26] and [17E][27] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   "omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   "typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   "layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   "indentation
        *   "position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   "format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   "format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   "position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   "punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   "Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   "case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   "format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   "small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   "schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   "running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   "format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
