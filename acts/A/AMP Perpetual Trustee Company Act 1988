An Act---
    
*   (a) to provide for a change of name by the Perpetual Trustees, Estate, and Agency Company of New Zealand (Limited); and

*   (b) to authorise the Company to transact business with the Australian Mutual Provident Society and with other subsidiaries of that society; and

*   (c) to consolidate the provisions of the Perpetual Trustees, Estate, and Agency Company Act 1884 and its amendments

*   #### Preamble
    
    Whereas, from the uncertainty of human life, and from other causes, great difficulty has from time to time arisen in securing the services of suitable persons for the office of executor, trustee, liquidator, guardian, and other similar offices: And whereas, in order to secure the more certain discharge of the duties of those offices a company by the name of the Perpetual Trustees, Estate, and Agency Company of New Zealand (Limited) (hereinafter called the Company) was, on 16 April 1884, formed and incorporated under the Companies Act 1882 with the object, among other purposes, of affording persons the opportunity of obtaining the services of a permanent corporation for the performance of the duties of those offices: And whereas, by the Perpetual Trustees, Estate, and Agency Company Act 1884, the Company has the power to act as executor, trustee, liquidator, guardian, or in any other similar capacity, to perform and discharge all the duties of those offices, and to receive remuneration for those duties: And whereas, the Company is a trustee company within the meaning of the [Trustee Companies Act 1967][22]: And whereas the Company is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Australian Mutual Provident Society (hereinafter called the AMP Society): And whereas the Company desires to change its name to AMP Perpetual Trustee Company N.Z. Limited: And whereas the Company also desires the power to transact with the AMP Society or any subsidiary of that society, should it think fit to do so, any business in connection with any estate or trust property that the Company may from time to time administer: And whereas legislation is the only expedient means by which the change of name of the Company and the empowering of the Company to transact any business with the AMP Society and with other subsidiaries of that society can be effected or permitted efficiently and economically and without interference with the conduct and continuity of the Company, the trusts under its administration, the Company's clients, and other persons having business with the Company: And whereas some of the objects of this Act cannot be attained otherwise than by legislation.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the AMP Perpetual Trustee Company Act 1988\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 March 2002, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][28] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][29] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][30] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][31] and [17E][32] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
