An Act for the further limitation of the Crown, and better securing the rights and liberties of the subject
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    Whereas in the first year of the reign of Your Majesty, and of our late Most Gracious Sovereign Lady Queen Mary (of blessed memory), an Act of Parliament was made, intituled ""An Act for declaring the Rights and Liberties of the Subject, and for settling the Succession of the Crown"", wherein it was (amongst other things) enacted, established, and declared, that the Crown and regal government of the kingdoms of England, France, and Ireland, and the dominions thereunto belonging, should be and continue to Your Majesty and the said late Queen, during the joint lives of Your Majesty and the said Queen, and to the survivor: And that, after the decease of Your Majesty and of the said Queen, the said Crown and regal government should be and remain to the heirs of the body of the said late Queen; and, for default of such issue, to Her Royal Highness the Princess Anne of Denmark, and the heirs of her body; and, for default of such issue, to the heirs of the body of Your Majesty; And it was thereby further enacted that all and every person and persons that then were or afterwards should be reconciled to, or shall hold communion with, the See or Church of Rome, or should profess the Popish religion, or marry a Papist, should be excluded, and are by that Act made for ever incapable to inherit, possess, or enjoy the Crown and government of this realm and Ireland, and the dominions thereunto belonging, or any part of the same, or to have, use, or exercise any regal power, authority, or jurisdiction within the same: And in all and every such case and cases the people of these realms shall be and are thereby absolved of their allegiance: And that the said Crown and government shall from time to time descend to and be enjoyed by such person or persons, being Protestants, as should have inherited and enjoyed the same in case the said person or persons, so reconciled, holding communion, professing, or marrying as aforesaid, were naturally dead: After the making of which Statute, and the settlement therein contained, Your Majesty's good subjects who were restored to the full and free possession and enjoyment of their religion, rights, and liberties, by the providence of God giving success to Your Majesty's just undertakings and unwearied endeavours for that purpose, had no greater temporal felicity to hope or wish for than to see a royal progeny descending from Your Majesty, to whom (under God) they owe their tranquillity, and whose ancestors have for many years been principal asserters of the Reformed religion and the liberties of Europe, and from our said Most Gracious Sovereign Lady, whose memory will always be precious to the subjects of these realms: And it having since pleased Almighty God to take away our said Sovereign Lady, and also the most hopeful Prince William Duke of Gloucester (the only surviving issue of Her Royal Highness the Princess Anne of Denmark), to the unspeakable grief and sorrow of Your Majesty and your said good subjects, who, under such losses being sensibly put in mind that it stands wholly in the pleasure of Almighty God to prolong the lives of Your Majesty and of Her Royal Highness, and to grant to Your Majesty, or to Her Royal Highness, such issue as may be inheritable to the Crown and regal government aforesaid, by the respective limitations in the said recited Act contained, do constantly implore the Divine mercy for those blessings: And Your Majesty's said subjects having daily experience of your royal care and concern for the present and future welfare of these kingdoms, and particularly recommending from your Throne a further provision to be made for the succession of the Crown in the Protestant line, for the happiness of the nation and the security of our religion; and it being absolutely necessary, for the safety, peace, and quiet of this realm, to obviate all doubts and contentions in the same by reason of any pretended title to the Crown, and to maintain a certainty in the succession thereof, to which your subjects may safely have recourse for their protection, in case the limitations in the said recited Act should determine.

##### 1 Princess Sophia declared next successor to the Crown, after the King and Princess Anne of Denmark and their issue, etc, and the heirs of her body, being Protestants
    
*   Therefore, for a further provision of the succession of the Crown in the Protestant line, we Your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, do beseech Your Majesty that it may be enacted and declared, and be it enacted and declared by the King's Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That the Most Excellent Princess Sophia, Electress and Duchess Dowager of Hanover, daughter of the Most Excellent Princess Elizabeth, late Queen of Bohemia, daughter of our late Sovereign Lord King James the First, of happy memory, be and is hereby declared to be the next in succession, in the Protestant line, to the Imperial Crown and Dignity of the said realms of England, France, and Ireland, with the dominions and territories thereunto belonging, after His Majesty, and the Princess Anne of Denmark, and in default of issue of the said Princess Anne and of His Majesty respectively; And that from and after the deceases of His said Majesty, our now Sovereign Lord, and of Her Royal Highness the Princess Anne of Denmark, and for default of issue of the said Princess Anne and of His Majesty respectively, the Crown and regal government of the said kingdoms of England, France, and Ireland, and of the dominions thereunto belonging, with the royal state and dignity of the said realms, and all honours, styles, titles, regalities, prerogatives, powers, jurisdictions, and authorities, to the same belonging and appertaining, shall be, remain, and continue to the said Most Excellent Princess Sophia, and the heirs of her body, being Protestants: And thereunto the said Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, shall and will, in the name of all the people of this realm, most humbly and faithfully submit themselves, their heirs and posterities; and do faithfully promise that after the deceases of His Majesty and Her Royal Highness, and the failure of the heirs of their respective bodies, to stand to, maintain, and defend the said Princess Sophia, and the heirs of her body, being Protestants, according to the limitation and succession of the Crown in this Act specified and contained, to the utmost of their powers, with their lives and estates, against all persons whatsoever that shall attempt anything to the contrary.

##### 2 Papists, etc, incapacitated from inheriting the Crown, King and Queen to take the Coronation Oath, and subscribe the Declaration
    
*   Provided always that all and every person and persons, who shall or may take or inherit the said Crown by virtue of the limitation of this present Act, and is, are, or shall be reconciled to, or shall hold communion with, the See or Church of Rome, or shall profess the Popish religion, or shall marry a Papist, shall be subject to such incapacities as in such case or cases are by the said recited Act provided, enacted, and established; And that every King and Queen of this realm, who shall come to and succeed in the Imperial Crown of this kingdom, by virtue of this Act, shall have the Coronation Oath administered to him, her, or them, at their respective coronations, according to the [Schedule][7] of the Accession Declaration Act 1910 and shall make, subscribe, and repeat the Declaration in the Act first above recited, mentioned, or referred to, in the manner and form thereby prescribed.
    
    Section 2: amended, on 3 August 1910, by [section 1][8] of the Accession Declaration Act 1910 (1910 10 Edw 7 and 1 Geo 5, c 29 (Imp)).

##### 3 Conditions for securing the religion, laws, etc, in default of issue of the Princess Anne and the King
    
*   And whereas it is requisite and necessary that some further provision be made for securing our religion, laws, and liberties from and after the death of His Majesty and the Princess Anne of Denmark, and in default of issue of the body of the said Princess and of His Majesty respectively:
    
    Be it enacted by the King's Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That whatsoever shall hereafter come to the possession of this Crown shall join in communion with the Church of England, as by law established.
    
    Section 3: amended, on 1 January 1989, by [section 4(1)][9] of the Imperial Laws Application Act 1988 (1988 No 112).

##### 4 The Laws and Statutes of the Realm confirmed
    
*   \[Repealed\]
    
    Section 4: repealed, on 1 January 1989, by [section 4(1)][9] of the Imperial Laws Application Act 1988 (1988 No 112).

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Act of Settlement 1700\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 January 1989, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][10] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][11] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][12] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][13] and [17E][14] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   "omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   "typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   "layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   "indentation
        *   "position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   "format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   "format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   "position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   "punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   "Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   "case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   "format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   "small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   "schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   "running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
