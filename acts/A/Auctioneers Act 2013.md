The Parliament of New Zealand enacts as follows:

##### 1 Title
    
*   This Act is the Auctioneers Act 2013\.

##### 2 Commencement
    
*   This Act comes into force on the day after the date on which it receives the Royal assent.

##### 3 Purpose of Act
    
*   This Act provides for the registration of auctioneers and for related matters, and repeals the [Auctioneers Act 1928][40].

##### 4 Interpretation
    
*   (1) In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,---
    
    _auction_ means a process in which property of any kind (including goods, services, and interests in land) is offered for sale by an auctioneer on behalf of a vendor, and---
        
    *   (a) bids for the property are placed with the auctioneer in real time, whether in person, by telephone, via the Internet, or by any other means; and
    
    *   (b) the property is sold when the auctioneer so indicates
    
    _chief executive_ means the chief executive of the department of State that, with the authority of the Prime Minister, is for the time being responsible for the administration of this Act
    
    _person concerned in the management of a company_ means---
        
    *   (a) a director of the company, as that term is defined in [section 126][41] of the Companies Act 1993:
    
    *   (b) the chief executive of the company, or any person occupying the equivalent position
    
    _register_ means the register of auctioneers maintained by the Registrar under [section 21][26]
    
    _registered auctioneer_ means an individual or a company that is registered under this Act as an auctioneer
    
    _Registrar_ means the Registrar of Auctioneers appointed under [section 19][24]
    
    _vendor_, in relation to an auction, means the person whose property is offered for sale by an auctioneer.
    
    (2) To avoid doubt, a process of selling property is not necessarily an auction for the purpose of this Act just because it is described as an auction. For example, a process described as an Internet auction, but that provides that any contract of sale resulting from the process is a contract directly between the winner of the bidding and the seller of the property, is not an auction for the purpose of this Act.

#### Registration requirements

##### 5 Registration of person carrying on business as auctioneer
    
*   (1) A person must not carry on business as an auctioneer unless the person is registered under this Act as a registered auctioneer.

    *   (b) [section 141][43] of the Motor Vehicle Sales Act 2003; and
    
    *   (c) any other enactment.
    
    (3) A person _carries on business as an auctioneer_ if the person, in trade, charges a fee or commission for, or requires the payment of any part of the proceeds of, a sale by auction, other than as an employee or agent of a registered auctioneer.

    *   (c) a person whose registration under this Act has been cancelled within the preceding 5 years; or
    
    *   (d) prohibited from being a director of, or being concerned or taking part in the management of, an incorporated or unincorporated body under any enactment or order made under any enactment; or
    
    *   (e) a person who has been convicted of a crime involving dishonesty within the preceding 5 years; or
    
    *   (f) a person who has been convicted, within the preceding 5 years, of---

    *   (b) the company's registration under this Act has been cancelled within the preceding 5 years; or
