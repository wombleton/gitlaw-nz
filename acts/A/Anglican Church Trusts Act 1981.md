An Act to widen the powers of trustees under trusts in connection with the Church of the Province of New Zealand and the Church of the Province of Melanesia and to provide for the administration of such trusts; and to consolidate and amend the Church of England Trusts Act 1913 and its amendments
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    Whereas there is real and personal property in New Zealand held on trusts for and in connection with the Anglican Churches in New Zealand and Melanesia:
    
    And whereas the powers of the trustees in relation to the investment of the trust assets are limited by the instruments creating the trusts:
    
    And whereas it is desirable to consolidate and extend the powers conferred on trustees by the Church of England Trusts Act 1913 and its amendments and to give greater powers of investment to the major Trust Boards holding property for the said Churches:
    
    And whereas there are trusts held for religious or charitable purposes in connection with the Anglican Church where it has become impossible or impracticable or inexpedient to carry out the trust objects or purposes, and by reason of the limited assets of the particular trusts or for reasons of expense it is desirable to provide a means for varying the trusts in addition to the means provided by the [Charitable Trusts Act 1957][36].

    _Aotearoa Council_ means the Aotearoa Council constituted under the canons of the Anglican Church
    
    _authorised Trust Board_, or _Board_, means any Board or Trust for the time being specified in [Schedule 1][32]

    (3) If in respect of any land to which this section applies it becomes or has become impossible or impracticable or inexpedient to carry out the object or purpose of the trust upon that land or by using that land (other than by leasing it), or the amount of land available is inadequate to carry it out, or the object or purpose has been effected already, the trustee may, in accordance with the succeeding provisions of this section, prepare or cause to be prepared a scheme for the application or disposal of the land for some other object or purpose of a kind specified in [section 11(b)][16], but not necessarily directly or indirectly associated with or relating to the Church.

    (6) No scheme prepared under this section shall have any effect unless and until it is approved by---
        
    *   (a) the High Court; or

    *   (b) if the court is satisfied that the scheme is one properly authorised by this section, it may approve the scheme notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the [Charitable Trusts Act 1957][36] or any other enactment or in any rule of law or in the trust instrument.
    
    (8) If a scheme is prepared for the approval of the appropriate Synod or (as the case may require) the Aotearoa Council or the New Zealand Advisory Council, the following provisions shall apply:
        
    *   (a) the provisions of subsections (2) and (3) of [section 12][17], and [sections 13][18], [14][19], and [15(1)][20] shall apply as if the scheme were prepared pursuant to section 12(1):

    *   (c) in reporting on the scheme the Chancellor or legal adviser shall have regard to any objections that are made by the Attorney-General within 90 days after the receipt of the notice, or, if the Attorney-General within that period notifies the Chancellor or legal adviser of the need for more time, within such further period not exceeding 90 days as the Attorney-General may specify in the notice:
    
    *   (d) if the Attorney-General objects on the ground that the scheme is not one that should be approved by the High Court pursuant to subsection (7), the scheme shall not be approved under this subsection:
    
    *   (e) [section 16][21] shall apply as if for the reference to [section 15(3)][20] there were substituted a reference to paragraph (d) of this subsection.
    
    (9) The trustee of any land to which this section may apply may in its discretion use any part of the trust property held by it on the same trusts as the land in question, or may charge that land as a contribution in whole or in part to the costs of any inquiry made under subsection (2), including the costs of research or otherwise of the trustee and of any other persons reasonably made a party to the inquiry irrespective of the outcome of such inquiry, and to the reasonable costs of the preparation, consideration, and approval of the scheme.
    
    (10) Every trust varied in accordance with the preceding provisions of this section shall be deemed to be a charitable trust for all purposes notwithstanding any other enactment or rule of law to the contrary.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Anglican Church Trusts Act 1981\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 20 June 2011, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][65] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][66] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][67] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][68] and [17E][69] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
