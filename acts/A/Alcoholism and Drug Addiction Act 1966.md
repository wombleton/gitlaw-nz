*   (1) On the application in the prescribed form of a relative (as defined in this section) of any person, or on the application in the prescribed form of a constable or of any other reputable person, that the person to whom the application relates is an alcoholic, any District Court Judge may if he thinks fit issue his summons to the alleged alcoholic to show cause why an order should not be made requiring him to be detained for treatment for alcoholism in an institution.
    
    (2) Where the application is made by a constable or by any person who is not a relative of the alleged alcoholic, the application shall contain a statement of the reason why it is made by the applicant instead of by a relative.
    
    (3) All statements contained in the application shall be verified by the statutory declaration of the applicant or of some other person, unless the District Court Judge otherwise permits, and, if the District Court Judge sees fit, by the evidence on oath of the applicant or some other person at the hearing of the application.
    
    (4) If, on any such application as aforesaid, the District Court Judge is satisfied, by evidence on oath, that a warrant is necessary to compel the attendance of the alleged alcoholic or that other circumstances exist that render the issue of a warrant expedient the District Court Judge may, whether or not a summons has been issued or served, issue his warrant for the arrest of the alleged alcoholic. Every person arrested pursuant to any such warrant shall be brought before a District Court Judge, as soon as possible, to be dealt with in accordance with this Act.
    
    (5) If the District Court Judge is satisfied that the alleged alcoholic has refused to undergo examination by 2 medical practitioners for the purposes of this Act or has wilfully failed to attend for any medical examination required for the purposes of this Act, he may issue his warrant under subsection (4) for the arrest of the alleged alcoholic and may at the same time order that the alleged alcoholic shall, after his arrest, undergo medical examination by 2 medical practitioners.
    
    (6) On the hearing of the application the District Court Judge shall not make an order under subsection (7) unless 2 medical practitioners either give evidence to the effect or give certificates in the prescribed form to the effect that they believe the alleged alcoholic to be an alcoholic within the meaning of this Act and that the making of an order for his detention and treatment as such is expedient in his own interest or in that of his relatives.
    
    (7) Subject to subsection (6), on the hearing of the application, the alleged alcoholic being then present before him, the District Court Judge may, if he thinks fit, and if he is satisfied of the truth of the application, and that the managers or the superintendent of an institution, as the case may require, are willing to receive the alcoholic into the institution, make an order requiring the alcoholic to be detained for treatment for alcoholism in that institution.
    
    (8) In this section, _relative_ means, in relation to an alleged alcoholic (**A**), any of the following:
        
    *   (a) A's spouse, civil union partner, or de facto partner:
    
    *   (b) A's parent, grandparent, sibling, half-sibling, child, grandchild, or step-child:
    
    *   (c) A's step-parent; but, if A is under the age of 18 years, only if the step-parent shares responsibility for the day-to-day care of A with a parent of A.
