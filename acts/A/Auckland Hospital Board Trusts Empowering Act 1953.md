    And whereas Ellen Edgar, late of Mount Eden, near Auckland, in New Zealand, widow, deceased, by her last will and testament dated 21 September 1939, probate whereof and 1 codicil thereto was granted by the Supreme Court of New Zealand at Auckland to the executor and trustee therein named on 24 September 1947, gave a one-fourth share in the residue of her real and personal estate to the Auckland Infirmary situate at One Tree Hill:
    
    And whereas the said one-fourth share amounting to the sum of 1,037 pounds and 6 pence was paid to the Auckland Hospital Board, being the authority in control of the said Auckland Infirmary:
    
    And whereas the amount held by the said Board to the credit of the Ellen Edgar Trust Fund on 31 March 1952 was 1,088 pounds 14 shillings and 8 pence:
    
    And whereas Thomas Francis Clemow, late of Auckland, in New Zealand, retired farmer, deceased, by his last will and testament dated 14 June 1940, probate whereof and 1 codicil thereto was granted by the Supreme Court of New Zealand at Auckland to the executor and trustee therein named on 21 October 1947, gave a one-third share in the residue of his real and personal estate to the Auckland Infirmary (commonly called the Old Men's Home) and directed that the receipt of the Auckland Hospital Board for the same should be a sufficient discharge to the said executor and trustee:
    
    And whereas the said one-third share of residue amounting to the sum of 2,408 pounds 6 shillings and 9 pence was paid to the said Board:
    
    And whereas the amount held by the said Board to the credit of the Thomas Francis Clemow Trust Fund on 31 March 1952 was 2,544 pounds 5 shillings and 7 pence:
    
    And whereas Eliza Potter, the wife of William Potter, of the City of Auckland, coachbuilder, deceased, by her last will and testament dated 26 March 1906, probate whereof and 1 codicil thereto was granted by the Supreme Court of New Zealand at Auckland to Frederick Seymour Potter, the executor and trustee therein named, on 1 February 1918, directed that upon the determination of certain prior trusts mentioned in the said will the residue of her estate should be held upon trust for the Auckland Hospital and Charitable Aid Board or other body corporate or trustees having the control or management of the Auckland Hospital to be applied by the said Board, body corporate, or trustees for the benefit of indigent sick persons who may from time to time become inmates of that hospital:
    
    And whereas the said Frederick Seymour Potter died at Auckland on or about 29 March 1941 and probate of his last will and testament bearing date 9 October 1939 was granted to William Wallace, land valuer, and Mary Elizabeth Potter, widow, both of Auckland, out of the Supreme Court of New Zealand at Auckland on 28 April 1941:
    
    And whereas by deed of appointment dated 20 August 1941 the said William Wallace and Mary Elizabeth Potter duly appointed Allan John Moody, solicitor, and Ernest Henry Wright, public accountant, both of Auckland, to be trustees of the will of the said Eliza Potter in the place and stead of the said Frederick Seymour Potter:

    And whereas the application and administration of the foregoing trusts have become difficult or impracticable or inexpedient either by reason of changes in the nature of the institutions hereinbefore mentioned or by reason of hospital and other benefits provided by the Social Security Act 1938 and its amendments:
    
    And whereas for the purpose of giving effect to the charitable intentions of the donors of the funds affected by the said several trusts it is expedient that the said trusts be varied in the manner hereinafter appearing:
    
    And whereas it is uncertain whether such variation of the said trusts can be attained otherwise than by legislation.

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][9] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.

For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][10] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][11] and [17E][12] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
