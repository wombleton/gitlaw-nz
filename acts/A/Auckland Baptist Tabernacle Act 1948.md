An Act to constitute and incorporate the Auckland Baptist Tabernacle and the Auckland Baptist Tabernacle Trust Board and to provide a constitution and rules for each of such bodies respectively and to declare the trusts upon which property shall hereafter be held by or on behalf of the Auckland Baptist Tabernacle and to provide for all incidental matters involved
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    Whereas in or about 1855 a number of persons of the religious denomination known as Baptists formed themselves into a Church, and subsequent thereto acquired a certain piece of land in Wellesley Street, Auckland, and erected thereon a chapel in which public worship was held in accordance with the usages and beliefs of the Baptist denomination:
    
    And whereas on 7 August 1883 one Frederick Battley, in whom the said piece of land was then vested, conveyed it to 7 named persons upon certain trusts then declared:
    
    And whereas, in consequence of the said chapel having become inadequate in course of time to the needs of its congregation, the trustees then in office sold the said piece of land and purchased a certain piece of land more particularly described in [Schedule 2][22] upon which there was later erected the chapel known as the Auckland Baptist Tabernacle and also a certain adjoining piece of land more particularly described in [Schedule 4][24] upon which was erected a certain commercial building known as the Tabernacle Buildings:
    
    And whereas in or about 1935 the trustees then in office, having filed a memorial in the office of the Supreme Court at Auckland under the provisions of Part 2 of the Religious, Charitable, and Educational Trusts Act 1908, became incorporated under such Act as the Auckland Baptist Tabernacle Trust Board:
    
    And whereas the Auckland Baptist Tabernacle in 1943 resolved to adopt a constitution and rules superseding the constitution and rules previously in force:
    
    And whereas doubts have arisen as to the trusts upon which the said pieces of land are held and as to certain matters relating to Church membership and administration:
    
    And whereas it is desirable that such doubts be resolved and that the Auckland Baptist Tabernacle and the Auckland Baptist Tabernacle Trust Board be incorporated by Act of Parliament.

*   The doctrine of the resurrection of the dead:
*   The doctrine of future Judgment, of eternal rewards and punishments.

Secondly, Duties---

*   The commemoration of the death of Christ in the observance of the Lord's Supper. The diligent use of the means of grace, and of promoting the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace.

## Part 2  
Rules

##### 1 Name
    
*   The Church shall be known as the Auckland Baptist Tabernacle. Every present and future member shall be deemed to accept these rules as a condition of his admission to membership.

##### 2 Conditions of admission to membership
    
*   There may be admitted to membership of the Church only those who have confessed their faith in the Lord Jesus Christ as Saviour and have been immersed in the Triune Name. In the case of candidates for admission to membership whose physical or medical condition makes baptism by immersion inadvisable, the Elders' Court hereinafter mentioned may, after examination of medical or other evidence, recommend admission of the particular candidate without baptism by immersion, and such recommendation shall be placed for decision before the Church business meeting at which the, application for membership is considered.

##### 3 Procedure for admission
    
*   A candidate for admission to membership of the Church shall in the first instance be interviewed by the Minister or, in the absence of the Minister, by an Elder, and shall be required to sign an application accepting the doctrinal beliefs and rules on which this Church is constituted. Two Church members selected for the purpose by the Church or Elders' Court shall thereafter interview the candidate and, as soon as conveniently may be following such interview, lodge with the Church Secretary a report addressed to the Elders' Court giving their views as to the suitability of the candidate for Church membership. In the event of the Elders' Court approving the application, it shall be brought before a Church business meeting at the first convenient opportunity for endorsement. Candidates may be admitted following a favourable vote on the application at a Church business meeting, but subject always to their having undergone immersion, except in those cases in which immersion is dispensed with under the terms of clause 2\.

##### 4 Admission by transfer
    
*   Baptised believers who are duly admitted members of other Baptist Churches may apply for membership of this Church by personal application to the Minister or, in the Minister's absence, to an Elder; upon receipt of a favourable report from the Minister or Elder the Church Secretary shall, with all convenient speed, forward to the applicant's previous Church a request that the member be transferred to this Church. To avoid delay, the Church Secretary shall be empowered, after consultation with the Minister, to give or request letters of transfer. Any such action shall be reported to and confirmed at the next following Church meeting.

##### 5 Roll revision
    
*   No member whose name appears on the Roll of membership of the Church shall permit his or her name to remain or to be entered upon the Roll or membership of any other church, and in the event of non-compliance with the foregoing provisions his or her name shall be removed from the Roll of membership of the Church in accordance with the Rules of the Church relating to membership:
    
    provided, however, that in the case of those persons to whom [section 7][10] applies, this Rule 5 shall not apply to such persons until the expiration of 3 months from the date of the passing of this Act.

##### 6 
    
*   The Membership Roll shall be subject to constant supervision by the Elders. Members whose attendance at the Communion service and other appointed meetings has lapsed or become irregular shall, if possible, be visited or written to in order to ascertain the reason for non-attendance. Any member who shall be absent from the Communion service for a period of 12 months continuously may be called upon for a good and sufficient reason for such absence. Should no good reason be given in response the name of the member concerned may be removed from the Roll by resolution of the Church meeting. The attendance card issued at Communion services if duly signed and returned by a member attending the service shall be accepted as proof of attendance. Notwithstanding anything hereinbefore contained the Church at a business meeting duly convened for the purpose may remove from the Roll of members the name of any person whom it may consider guilty of conduct of a scandalous or grossly improper nature or inconsistent with the Christian way of living. The member shall be given reasonable opportunity to attend and answer any charges made against him or her.

##### 7 Appeal against removal from Roll
    
*   Any member who may be aggrieved by a decision of the Church to remove his name from the Roll of Members, whether on a roll revision or otherwise, may appeal against such removal, provided he deposits a written notice of appeal with the Minister or the Church Secretary within 1 month of his receiving notice of the Church's decision to remove his name in terms of the preceding rule; such notice of appeal shall not be required to be in any particular form, but shall specify the grounds of the appeal. Upon receipt of such notice by the Minister or Church Secretary, the appeal shall immediately be notified to the Church Officers, who shall refer it forthwith to an Appeal Committee consisting of 1 member nominated by the Church Officers, 1 member nominated by the appellant (both such persons to be members of the Auckland Baptist Tabernacle), and 1 person, not being a member of the Church, to be selected by the 2 members nominated as aforesaid; such person shall be chairman and convener of the Committee of Appeal and must be a member of a Baptist Church; the Committee of Appeal shall decide its own procedure on the appeal before it and shall decide whether the appellant and the Church or either of them shall be entitled to be represented by Counsel or by a friend. In its consideration of the case before it the Committee shall be guided by Baptist practices and principles. The Committee shall deliver to the Church and to the appellant respectively its findings on the appeal within twenty-one (21) days of the hearing of the appeal being concluded; in the event of a member's appeal being allowed, the Church shall forthwith cause the name of the appellant to be restored to the Roll from which it has been removed. In any case in which it thinks fit so to do, the Church may restore a name to the roll without requiring the propriety of its removal to be determined by an Appeal Committee. In the event of undue delay in the nomination of members of the Committee of Appeal or in the selection of the chairman thereof, a Judge of the High Court, may, on summary application in that behalf, appoint any member or members of the said Committee including the Chairman thereof.
    
    Schedule 1 Rule 7: amended, on 1 January 2004, by [section 48(1)][28] of the Supreme Court Act 2003 (2003 No 53).

##### 9 Church business meetings
    
*   Ordinary Church business meetings shall be held at least monthly, except in the months of December and January, at a time and place appointed by the Deacons.

At such ordinary meetings the business shall consist of the adoption of the minutes and financial statement, the consideration of reports, and questions relating to the admission of particular persons to the Roll of Church Members, and any other business required by these Rules to be dealt with at a Church business meeting or otherwise lawfully brought forward. Any other business shall be deemed special and shall not be dealt with unless at least 14 days' prior notice of intention to introduce it and of its nature shall have been given to the Elders and Deacons. The Church officers may at any time direct the Secretary to convene a special meeting of Church members, and the Secretary shall thereupon convene such meeting by posting in a prominent place in the vestibule of the Church at least 14 days before the date fixed for such meeting a notice stating the time and place thereof and the nature of the business to be brought forward thereat. In addition notice of the meeting shall be given at the regular services of the Church on the 2 Lord's Days before the meeting.

##### 10 Regarding meetings generally
    
*   No Church meeting shall continue after the hour of 9.30 pm, unless the meeting so decides. All questions raised shall be decided by the votes of members present. With the consent of the meeting, a member may introduce a question relative to the welfare of the Church not covered by the agenda for the meeting, but in the event of objection being taken to his doing so he may be required by the meeting to give notice to introduce the question at a subsequent Church meeting. The quorum for any Church business meeting shall be 50\.

##### 11 Conduct of meetings
    
*   Unless otherwise herein provided or unless otherwise decided by any meeting, the Minister when present shall preside at all meetings of Church members, except when the business before the meeting relates to him in his personal capacity or he is unwilling or unable to act or when there is no Minister of the Church for the time being. In such cases the meeting shall elect a Chairman from the Elders or Deacons present or, in the event of no Elder or Deacon being present or being willing to act, then from such members who may be willing to act. The discussion shall be conducted according to the ordinary rules of Parliamentary debate and all questions shall be decided by the votes of members present, and that either on the voices or by the show of hands or by ballot as the meeting may decide:
    
    provided that a ballot shall be taken if at least 10% of the members present so desire. Voting by proxy shall not be permitted at any Church meeting.

##### 12 Annual meeting
    
*   The Church shall hold a meeting annually, to be called the annual meeting, during September, or as soon thereafter as the Elders and Deacons may be able to arrange; at such meeting the Church Secretary shall present a report, previously approved by the Elders and Deacons, on the work of the Church and its agencies during the previous Church year ending on 31 July. In addition, the Church Treasurer shall submit a balance sheet and statement of the receipts and expenditure of the Church during the same period; such balance sheet and statement of receipts and expenditure shall be duly audited by a public accountant.

##### 13 Requisitioned meeting
    
*   The Secretary shall, on receipt of a requisition to that effect signed by at least three one-hundredths of members on the Church Roll, provided the number of members signing the requisition shall not be less than 30 in any case and provided the nature of the business proposed to be discussed is clearly stated in the requisition, call a special meeting of Church members in manner prescribed by these rules for the purpose of discussing the business referred to in the requisition. In the event of the Secretary failing, for a period of 14 days after the receipt of such a requisition, to call a meeting in compliance with such requisition, the requisitionists may themselves call a meeting of Church members by posting in a prominent place in the vestibule of the Church at least 2 Lord's Days before the date fixed for such meeting a notice signed by all the requisitionists stating the time and place thereof and the nature of the business to be brought forward thereat.

##### 14 Agencies of the Church
    
*   The activities and agencies of the Church, apart from ordinary Church services, shall be such as the Church has hitherto conducted or sponsored, with the addition of such other activities or agencies as may be approved by the Church from time to time. Unless otherwise herein provided, the Minister shall be _ex officio_ President of all agencies and activities of the Church, other than any Board set up to administer any part or parts of the property of the Church. The Minister for the time being shall not be eligible for membership of any Board administering any property of a commercial character owned by the Church; each Church agency shall elect its own Chairman and, except as aforesaid, the Minister shall be eligible to act as Chairman.

##### 15 Minutes
    
*   Minutes of all Church meetings shall be duly kept, and, upon being approved in the customary manner and signed by the Chairman at that or a subsequent meeting as a correct record, shall for all purposes be deemed conclusive, except in the case of manifest error.

##### 16 Access to records
    
*   Every member shall have the right at any reasonable time to inspect the Church Roll and the Church Minute Book, but he shall not be entitled to make copies or extracts therefrom without the consent of the Church Officers.

##### 17 Election of Elders and Deacons
    
*   The Church shall appoint Elders and Deacons, who shall exercise the functions hitherto and usually exercised by Elders and Deacons of a Church of the Baptist denomination. The Elders and Deacons in office upon the passing of the Act adopting these rules shall continue in office until the next annual meeting of the Church, when 2 Elders and 2 Deacons shall retire as hereinafter provided and an election held to fill the places of those so retiring. Until otherwise determined, the number of ordinary members of each Court of Elders and Deacons respectively shall not exceed 12, and the quorum for either Court shall be 5; in addition, the Church Secretary shall be _ex officio_ a member of both Courts and the Church Treasurer shall be _ex officio_ a member of the Deacon's Court. No person shall be qualified to be a member either of the Elders' Court or the Deacons' Court unless he has attained the age of 25 years and has been on the Roll of Members of the Church for at least 2 years. At every annual meeting 2 Elders and 2 Deacons shall retire by rotation. The members to retire each year shall be chosen by lot from amongst those longest in office since last elected.
    
    Retiring members shall not be eligible for re-election until the next annual meeting of the Church. Each Court may fill casual vacancies occurring from time to time, but any appointment so made shall be subject to confirmation at the next Church business meeting. Every candidate for election at the annual meeting shall be nominated in writing by 2 members of the Church Roll of Membership, and the nomination paper, with the candidate's acceptance of nomination endorsed thereon, shall be lodged with the Church Secretary from at least 14 clear days before the date fixed for the annual meeting.

*   At the annual meeting the following other officers shall be elected---namely, Church Secretary, Church Treasurer, Choirmaster, Organist, Auditor, and any other officers, not otherwise provided for herein, whom the Church may desire to appoint. All these officers shall retire annually and be eligible for re-election. For each of these offices written nominations shall be lodged with the Church Secretary at least 7 clear days prior to the date fixed for the annual meeting. Any casual vacancy occurring in any of the offices referred to in this paragraph shall be filled by the Church at a Church business meeting, and the person elected shall hold office during the unexpired portion of the term of his predecessor.

In addition, notice of the meeting shall be given at the regular services of the Church on the 2 Lord's Days before the meeting. Should the Court of Officers fail to make a recommendation within 6 calendar months of the vacancy occurring, a meeting of Church members may be convened under these rules for the purpose of nominating some person to fill the vacancy. No resolution of a Church meeting extending a call to the pulpit of the Church shall be deemed to be carried unless passed by the vote of at least three-quarters of members of the Church present in person at a duly convened meeting called for the purpose.

##### 26 Removal of Minister
    
*   The Church may at any time remove a Minister by resolution passed at a duly convened meeting of Church members called for the purpose, provided due notice of the time, place, and purpose of the meeting shall have been posted to such members at their last known place of abode at least 14 days before the date fixed for such meeting. No resolution as aforesaid shall be deemed to be carried unless passed by the votes of at least 55% in number of members of the Church present in person at such meeting.

Secondly, in or towards the repayment of the whole or any part of any moneys whatsoever owing from time to time by the Trust Board if in the opinion of the Trust Board (but with the approval of a properly convened business meeting of the Church as defined by paragraph (6) of this Section I) it is expedient to make such payment out of income.

Before forwarding the said report to the Church the Trust Board shall afford to the Elders and Deacons of the Church a reasonable opportunity of discussing with the Trust Board the recommendations to be made by the Trust Board as to the allocation of the net available income:

*   (2) if the recommendations of the Trust Board are accepted wholly or in part by a properly convened business meeting of the Church within a period of 2 months after the report of the Trust Board is received by the Church, then to the extent to which such recommendations have been accepted as aforesaid the Trust Board shall with all reasonable speed apply the net available income in accordance therewith:

*   (3) if within such period of 2 months after the said report of the Trust Board is received by the Church any recommendations as to the allocation of the whole or part of such net available income differing from or modifying or adding to the recommendations of the Trust Board are made by a duly convened business meeting of the Church (hereinafter referred to as _the Church's recommendations_) then to the extent to which the Church's recommendations are within the net available income objects, the Trust Board shall with all reasonable speed apply the net available income in accordance with the Church's recommendations:

*   (4) provided, however, that if the Trust Board acting on the advice of a barrister considers that the Church's recommendations are as to the whole or part thereof not within the net available income objects, the matter in difference between the Trust Board and the Church shall be determined by arbitration under and in accordance with the provisions of the Arbitration Act 1908 and its amendments, or of any Act or Acts passed in substitution therefor:

*   (5) the method of allocation determined in accordance with the foregoing procedure may, but need not necessarily, dispose of the entire net available income for the time being in the hands of the Trust Board:

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Auckland Baptist Tabernacle Act 1948\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 January 2004, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][42] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][43] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][44] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][45] and [17E][46] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   "omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   "typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   "layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   "indentation
        *   "position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   "format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   "format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   "position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   "punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   "Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   "case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   "format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   "small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   "schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   "running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   "format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
