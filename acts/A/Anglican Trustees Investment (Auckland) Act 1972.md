An Act to facilitate the investment of trust funds held upon charitable and religious trusts in divers and sundry trusts throughout the Anglican Diocese of Auckland
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    Whereas there are now divers and sundry trust funds throughout the Anglican Diocese of Auckland held by divers individual trustees and by the General Trust Board of the Diocese of Auckland upon sundry trusts for special purposes in connection with parishes and churches throughout the Auckland Diocese for religious, educational, or other charitable purposes: 
    
    And whereas the various trustees thereof are restricted by the instruments creating such trusts or otherwise howsoever by law in investing the trust funds: 
    
    And whereas it is considered expedient and desirable that the capital of such trust funds shall be invested in investments on a wider basis than heretofor: 
    
    And whereas many of the separate trust funds aforesaid comprise small amounts of capital which if amalgamated with other trust funds of a like nature could be more readily invested:
    
    And whereas within the said Diocese an investment trust board has been set up with wider powers of investment than those conferred upon trustees under and by virtue of the [Trustee Act 1956][11], for the sole purpose of being a trustee to hold and invest in its own name trust funds transferred to it pursuant to the provisions of this Act, and to account for and pay the net income arising from such investments and on request to repay capital to the trustees of the respective funds for administration thereof by such trustees in accordance with the provisions of their respective trust instruments: 
    
    And whereas the trustees of the various said trusts would be in breach of trust if they were to transfer their trust funds to the said investment trust board for investment unless authorised so to do by this Act.

##### 2 Interpretation
    
*   In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,---
    
    _Anglican_ or _Anglican Church_ means the Church of the Province of New Zealand commonly called the Church of England or the Anglican Church
    
    _Board_ means the trustees for the time being of the trust deed
    
    _trust deed_ means the deed of trust bearing date 25 July 1972, a copy of which is set forth in the [Schedule][10]
    
    _trustee_ means any person or persons, whether incorporated or not, now or hereafter holding trust funds upon trust for any Anglican religious, educational, or other charitable purpose of the Anglican Diocese of Auckland or any part thereof, and, without derogating from the generality of the foregoing, in particular means trustees of such trusts the objects of which are limited to a particular Anglican Parish or to a particular Anglican Church or the members of a particular Anglican congregation.

##### 3 Transfer of trust funds
    
*   Subject to any direction to the contrary contained in the instrument creating the trust, any trustee may transfer the whole or any part or parts of any trust fund held by the trustee upon trust for any Anglican religious, educational, or other charitable purpose to the Board to be held by it as trustee thereof with the powers and subject to the terms and conditions conferred and imposed upon the Board under and by virtue of the trust deed, notwithstanding that the powers of investment conferred upon the Board by the trust deed are wider than the powers conferred upon the trustee by the instrument creating such trust.

##### 4 Advice on investments

WHEREAS:
    
*   (1) There exist throughout the Diocese of Auckland divers trusts for Anglican religious, educational, or other charitable purposes wherein the trustees thereof have limited powers of investment of the trust funds and by reason thereof and of the continuous depreciation of the purchasing power of money the capital of such funds in terms of purchasing power has been and still is being seriously eroded.

*   (2) The Synod of the Anglican Diocese of Auckland is desirous of creating a common fund under the control of a board of trustees in which the capital of divers and sundry trust funds now existing in or which may be hereafter created in the said Diocese and held upon trust for religious, educational, or other charitable trusts may be invested; such board of trustees having power to invest such capital in accordance with the provisions hereinafter contained in these presents to the intent that the erosion hereinbefore mentioned in recital (1) hereof may be stopped or checked by selecting investments which have a potential capital growth.

*   (3) It is intended that the above-mentioned Board should make application to be incorporated under the provisions of the [Charitable Trusts Act 1957][12].

*   (4) It is intended to promote an Act of the General Assembly of New Zealand in Parliament authorising trustees of any Anglican trust within the said Diocese holding funds upon trust for any religious, educational, or other charitable purpose to transfer such funds to the Board for the purposes hereinbefore set forth in recital (2).

*   (5) The above-named persons (herein called "the Board") have jointly and severally agreed to act as trustees of this deed.

        *   (ii) In debentures, including debenture stock and bonds and whether constituting a charge on assets or not, secured by a trust deed and issued by any company in which at the time of investment it would have been permissible to invest in the purchase of ordinary stock or shares;

The Board may borrow or arrange credit by way of bank overdraft at any bank (whether secured or unsecured) for any purpose which is in the opinion of the Board of a temporary nature only provided that the amount of such borrowing or credit shall not exceed one-twentieth of the value of the total assets of the Trust Fund at the time of such borrowing or arrangement of credit and save and except as aforesaid or pursuant to the provisions of clause III(c)(i) the Board shall not borrow any moneys or give any mortgage or charge over the Trust Fund or any part or parts thereof.

VI.
    
*   (1) For the purposes of this clause VI the following phrases shall have the following meaning:
    
    "Annual balance date" shall mean the date upon which the Board shall in its absolute discretion determine as the day of the year as at which the assets comprising the long-term fund shall be valued, provided always the Board may from time to time resolve that the annual balance date shall be changed upon giving not less than 12 months' notice in writing of the new annual balance date to each and every trustee who has funds invested in the long-term fund at the date of the passing of such resolution.
    
    "Long-term fund" shall mean the investment fund in which money invested therein on behalf of any trustee shall be invested for a period of not less than 2 years and which may be withdrawn therefrom at any time after the expiration of the said period of 2 years provided that the trustees concerned shall have given to the Board not less than 12 months' notice in writing prior to the date of withdrawal.
    
    "Short-term fund" shall mean the investment fund in which moneys invested therein on behalf of any trustee may be withdrawn at any time by the trustee concerned giving to the Board not less than 2 months' notice in writing prior to the date of withdrawal.

*   (2) Any trustee depositing money or transferring assets to the Board pursuant to these presents shall nominate how much (if any) thereof shall be invested in the long-term fund and how much (if any) thereof shall be invested in the short-term fund.

(3)
    
*   (a) The costs of acquiring and of disposing and of valuing any asset forming part of the long-term fund shall be paid out of the capital thereof and any costs of administration of the long-term fund shall be paid out of the income arising from the long-term fund.

*   (b) The assets comprising the long-term fund (other than investments in any fee simple or leasehold interest in real property) shall be valued as at the annual balance date in each year and any investments in any fee simple or leasehold interest as at the annual balance date not less than once in every 3 years by an independent valuer appointed by the Board, provided always in any year in which any such asset is not valued by an independent valuer the value for the purposes of the next succeeding paragraph (c) of this subclause (3) shall be the purchase price thereof (excluding any costs incurred in the acquisition thereof) if no value thereof has been made by an independent valuer or the latest value thereof made by an independent valuer.

*   (c) As at the annual balance date in each year the aggregate costs of acquiring and disposing and valuing of any asset forming part of the long-term fund incurred during the preceding year shall be deducted from the aggregate value of all the assets comprised in the long-term fund as at the annual balance date and the balance thereof is hereinafter referred to as the capital value of the long-term fund, provided always that for the purposes of calculating the capital value of the long-term fund any costs incurred in valuing any asset as at an annual balance date shall be deemed to have been incurred immediately prior to such annual balance date.

*   (d) The Board shall in each year calculate the percentage of gain or loss in the capital value of the long-term fund during the year preceding the annual balance date and shall credit or debit the capital account of each and every trustee having funds invested in the long-term fund on the annual balance date with such percentage as at the annual balance date.

*   (e) In the event of any trustee withdrawing any capital from the long-term fund the value of the investment of such trustee shall be the value thereof as determined at the last annual balance date prior to the date of withdrawal after such percentage has been credited or debited in accordance with the provisions of the preceding paragraph (d) of this subclause (3).

*   (f) All income arising from the long-term fund shall be first applied in or towards any administration costs charged against the long-term fund pursuant to the provisions of subclause (5) of this clause VI the balance of such income shall be divisible amongst and paid to the trustees having investments therein in due proportion according to the same ratio as the capital value of the investments of each trustee bears to the capital value of the long-term fund. The Board in its absolute discretion may from time to time declare and pay income at any date between one annual balance date and the next succeeding balance date, provided always in the event of any trustee withdrawing capital from the long-term fund save and except when the withdrawal date coincides with the annual balance date the Board shall not be bound to pay any income in respect of such capital so withdrawn which has accrued since the date upon which the Board has last calculated the income of the long-term fund for the purpose of paying income to trustees having investments therein.

*   (4) All the income (including any capital gain) arising from the short-term fund shall first be applied in or towards the costs incurred by the Board in the acquisition or disposition or valuation of any investment forming part of the short-term fund and any administration costs charged against the short-term fund pursuant to the provisions of subclause (5) of this clause VI and in or towards the recoupment of any capital loss suffered in the short-term fund. The balance of such income shall be divisible amongst and paid to the trustees having funds therein in due proportion in accordance with the same ratio as the capital invested of each trust therein bears to the total capital therein at the date at which the Board shall cause such balance of income to be calculated, provided always in respect of any capital withdrawn from the fund the trustee shall not be entitled to participate in the division of any income which has accrued to the short-term fund since the date upon which the balance of income was last calculated, provided further the Board shall cause the balance of the income of the short-term fund to be calculated on not less than 4 days in each calendar year at approximately equal intervals upon such dates as the Board in its absolute discretion shall from time to time determine.

*   (5) For the purposes of paragraph (f) of subclause (3) and subclause (4) of this clause VI the Board in its absolute discretion shall apportion as it thinks fit between the long-term fund and the short-term fund any costs incurred by it in administering the funds which in the opinion of the Board are not specifically attributable either to the long-term fund or the short-term fund and such costs so apportioned shall be charged against the funds respectively.

VII.
    
*   (i) The Board shall not be responsible for seeing to the application by any trustee of any moneys paid by the Board to such trustees and the receipt of such trustee for such payments shall be a full and sufficient discharge to the Board for such moneys so paid.

*   (ii) The Board shall not be liable for any loss arising from or out of or in connection with or in relation to any fall in the capital value of any investment lawfully made or acquired or retained by the Board forming part of the Trust Fund.

VIII.(i)
    
*   (a) The Board shall consist of not less than 4 members, all of whom shall be communicant lay members of the Anglican Church.

The 2 members who shall then retire shall be selected by ballot and shall be eligible for re-election.

*   (c) Save as provided in the preceding paragraph (b) hereof a member shall hold office for a period of 4 years from the date of his election and on retirement shall be eligible for re-election until such time as he shall have attained the age of seventy (70) years. Provided always a member holding office and attaining the age of seventy (70) years shall not be bound to retire until the expiry of a period 4 years from the date of his last election to office.

    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][19] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][20] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][21] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][22] and [17E][23] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   "omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   "typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   "layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   "indentation
        *   "position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   "format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   "format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   "position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   "punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)

        *   "small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   "schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   "running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   "format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
