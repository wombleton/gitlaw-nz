An Act to consolidate and amend the Auckland Improvement (Albert Barrack Reserves) Act 1872 and its amendments
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    Whereas certain land in the City of Auckland (in this Preamble referred to as the _said land_) is vested in the Council of the City of Auckland (in this Preamble referred to as _the Council_) subject to the provisions of the Auckland Improvement (Albert Barrack Reserves) Act 1872, the Auckland Improvement Act 1873, and the Auckland Improvement Commissioners' Transfer of Powers Act 1879:
    
    And whereas various difficulties have arisen in connection with the administration of the said land and special provision has been made by [section 33][18] of the Local Legislation Act 1961, [section 17][19] of the Local Legislation Act 1964, [section 20][20] of the Local Legislation Act 1965, and [section 22][21] of the Local Legislation Act 1967, with regard to the said land:
    
    And whereas the part of the land firstly described in [Schedule 1][16] and known as Albert Park is reserved for recreation and amusement:
    
    And whereas the Council is empowered to lease other parts of the said land:
    
    And whereas section 7 of the Auckland Improvement Commissioners' Transfer of Powers Act 1879 provides that the residual purpose for which money received under that Act may be applied is in works of public utility or ornament, or in furtherance of education, science, and art in the City of Auckland, to be determined by the City Council, but not in any way in reduction or aid of rates, ordinary or special:
    
    And whereas since the year 1879 the powers of expenditure conferred upon municipal corporations generally have been considerably enlarged and expanded and it is now difficult to stipulate a purpose for the expenditure of the residue of the income arising from the said land, and it is expedient that the Council should be empowered to apply such income in its discretion for all or any of the purposes set out in [section 8][11]:
    
    And whereas the land fourthly described in [Schedule 1][16] and known as Alten Road Reserve became vested in the Council pursuant to the provisions of the [Auckland Reserves Exchange and Change of Trust Act 1881][22] which enacted that the Council might in its discretion enclose, lay out, and plant the same, or erect any building or buildings for ornamental purposes, but not for making a profit therefrom, but should not otherwise deal with the same:
    
    And whereas it is desirable that provision be made in this Act with regard to the Alten Road Reserve:
    
    And whereas part of the land vested in the Council by the Auckland Improvement Commissioners' Transfer of Powers Act 1879 was by subsection (1) of section 2 of the Courthouse Sites Exchange Act 1902 vested in His Majesty the King as part of the site of the Magistrate's Courthouse in the City of Auckland and the land received by the Council in exchange was vested in it for the purposes of a public street, part of which street was later duly stopped:
    
    And whereas part of the stopped street containing 0.5 of a perch, more or less, is included in the residue of the land comprised in certificate of title, Volume 113, folio 13, which residue is part of the land sixthly described in [Schedule 1][16]:
    
    And whereas the Council, in the belief that the said part of the stopped street with an area of 0.5 of a perch was part of the said land included it in a lease of parts of the said land:
    
    And whereas it is expedient that the part of stopped street be held by the Council subject to the provisions of this Act and that the leasing of it should be validated:
    
    And whereas in 1956 Her Majesty the Queen acquired for education purposes certain parts of the land vested in the Council by the Auckland Improvement Commissioners' Transfer of Powers Act 1879 and in exchange therefor caused certain other land to be vested in the Council free of any trusts:
    
    And whereas the Council in the belief it had power so to do, sold and exchanged portions of the land last referred to, and the land received by the Council in those latter exchanges was also vested in it free of any trust:
    
    And whereas it is expedient that the said exchanges and sales should be validated and that the balance of the land received by the Council in the said recited exchanges, being the land ninthly described in [Schedule 1][16] should be held by the Council subject to the provisions of this Act:
    
    And whereas it is desirable that the statutory provisions relating to the said land and to the money and investments comprising the capital and income of the Council's Improvement Trust Account should be consolidated.
    
    Preamble: amended, on 8 July 1986, by [section 2(2)][23] of the Auckland Improvement Trust Amendment Act 1986 (1986 No 3 (L)).

    (2) The land secondly described in [Schedule 1][16], being part of the land vested in the Council by the Auckland Improvement Commissioners' Transfer of Powers Act 1879 and being land duly leased in various parcels under leases which terminate on various dates between the years 1974 and 1977, shall become part of Albert Park as from the expiration of each such lease, and the land comprised in the lease shall thereupon become subject to the provisions of subsection (1) as if it were part of the land firstly described in [Schedule 1][16].
    
    (3) Subject to subsection (4), the Council shall, as soon as reasonably possible after the termination of each such lease, remove or demolish any buildings, structures, or other erections on the land comprised in the lease and form, lay out, and develop the land as an addition to Albert Park with all cultivation, planting, ornamentation, structures, buildings, and facilities, as the Council considers desirable or necessary for the full use of Albert Park:
    
    provided that the Council may postpone, for so long as it in its absolute discretion shall think fit, the removal or demolition of any such building and may permit the same to remain on Albert Park if such building, in the opinion of the Council, is capable of being used, and is used, as an amenity for the public in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (j) of subsection (1) of section 32 of the Reserves and Domains Act 1953 and with the provisions of subsection (2) of this section; and any money required to be expended on such building may be provided by the Council out of the funds, capital or income, that are subject to the provisions of this Act, or out of funds available to the Council by virtue of the provisions of the Reserves and Domains Act 1953\.
    
    (4) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (2) and (3), the Council may from time to time, in its absolute discretion, postpone the removal or demolition of any other such building or part thereof to which the proviso to subsection (3) has not been applied, and the same and the curtilages thereof shall not become part of Albert Park until the Council later so resolves in the same manner as is provided in subsection (5), and in the meantime the Council may use that building or buildings or any part thereof for any 1 or more of the following purposes:
        
    *   (a) as an example of Victorian architecture and as a repository of Victorian decor and furnishings; and the Council may pay the cost of such furnishings out of the capital of its Improvement Trust Account; or
    
    *   (b) for the holding of civic functions by the Council; and the Council is hereby empowered to provide suitable furnishings and fittings for that purpose, and to spend money out of its general account on the provision and maintenance of such furnishings and fittings; or
    
    *   (c) to use or permit the same to be used as a public tearoom or refreshment room or similar amenity upon such terms and conditions as the Council thinks fit; and the Council is hereby empowered to pay the cost of establishing and maintaining any such amenity out of the capital or income of its Improvement Trust Account; or
    
    *   (d) to let or lease the same and the curtilages thereof, subject to the conditions set out in [section 4A][7], for such professional, commercial, cultural, or community purposes as the Council shall consider most in keeping with the character of the particular building or part thereof:
    
    provided that the Council shall so far as is practicable ensure that, in the case of a building or part thereof used for any of the foregoing purposes, its original design and decoration, both exterior and interior as existing on the commencement of this Act will be preserved; and the Council may pay any cost incurred by it in the repair or maintenance of any such building or part thereof out of the capital or income of its Improvement Trust Account.
    
    (5) The Council may from time to time, by ordinary resolution, add the whole or any part of the land thirdly described in [Schedule 1][16], being land vested in the Council and adjoining the land secondly described in [Schedule 1][16], to Albert Park as from a date to be specified in the resolution; and as from that date the land to which the resolution relates shall become subject to the provisions of subsection (1) as if it were part of the land firstly described in [Schedule 1][16].
    
    (6) Until the Council passes a resolution under subsection (5) in respect of that part of the land thirdly described in [Schedule 1][16] (old Synagogue site), or in respect of any part of it, the Council may let or lease the same or any remaining part to which such a resolution has not been applied, for such professional, commercial, cultural, or community purposes as the Council considers will be likely to require minimum interference with the external appearance of the old Synagogue building, yet will ensure that the building is kept in constant use.
    
    (6A) Any such letting or leasing may permit the tenant or lessee, subject to the Council's supervision, to make alterations or additions to that building, within the foregoing limitations, but the Council may nevertheless permit the demolition or replacement of any other building on the said land if, in the Council's opinion, such demolition or replacement would enhance the appearance or impact of the old Synagogue building and will assist with the financial viability of the use to which the property is to be put.
    
    (6B) Any use of the said land and of any building on it, and any proposed alteration to the old Synagogue building, shall comply with the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1977 and of the Historic Places Act 1980\.
    
    (6C) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Act, any lease granted pursuant to subsection (6) may be for such term, either less or more than 21 years, as the Council thinks fit, but any lease for a total term in excess of the period authorised by [section 4A(1)(b)][7] shall contain a provision that it may be terminated by the Council at any time after the expiration of the maximum period stated in that section (which shall run from the date of commencement of that lease or any earlier lease granted pursuant to this Act) after having given not less than 12 months' notice in writing of intention so to do, if in the Council's opinion it is in the public interest that the lease should be terminated so as to make the property available for the public in general.
    
    (6D) Any termination of a lease under subsection (6C) shall be subject to the payment of compensation by the Council to the lessee for the fair market value of the undertaking as a going concern and, in determining the fair market value, regard shall be had to such matters as may be appropriate including, but not by way of limitation, the following matters:
        
    *   (a) the value of the lessee's improvements (as defined in section 2 of the Valuation of Land Act 1951) at the time of termination:
    
    *   (b) the value of the chattels, fixtures, and fittings:
    
    *   (c) the value of goodwill.
    
    (6E) In case of disagreement, the fair market value shall be determined by arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Act 1908\.
    
    (6F) [Section 4A(1)(g)][7] shall be read subject to the provisions of subsections (6A) and (6C).
    
    (6G) Any tenant or lessee of the said land or any part of it may, with the prior written consent of the Council, sublet or sublease a portion of the land for such term and subject to such conditions and restrictions as the Council may stipulate.
    
    (6H) Any resolution passed pursuant to subsection (5), and any letting or leasing or subletting or subleasing as authorised by this section, shall be deemed not to be a subdivision of the land thirdly described in [Schedule 1][16] for the purposes of [Part 20][31] of the Local Government Act 1974 or for any other purpose.
    
    (7) For the avoidance of doubt it is hereby declared that Albert Park as from time to time constituted is a public reserve within the meaning of the Reserves and Domains Act 1953\.

    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][46] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][47] and [17E][48] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
