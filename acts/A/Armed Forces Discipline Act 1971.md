    (3) Where 2 or more persons subject to this Act form a common intention to prosecute an unlawful purpose, and to assist each other in that purpose, and one of them commits an offence against this Act, the other or others of them shall be a party or parties to the offence if the offence was committed in the prosecution of the common purpose and the commission of the offence was known by the last-mentioned person or persons to be a probable consequence of the common purpose.
    
    (4) Every person subject to this Act who is, by virtue of paragraphs (b) to (e) of subsection (1), a party to an offence against this Act (whether or not the offence is actually committed) commits an offence, and is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years if the maximum punishment for that offence exceeds 7 years' imprisonment, and, in any other case, is liable to the same punishment as if he had actually committed the offence.
    
    (5) Every person subject to this Act who incites, counsels, or procures any other person subject to this Act to be a party to an offence against this Act of which that other person is afterwards convicted is a party to that offence, although it may have been committed in a way different from that which was incited, counselled, or suggested.

    (2) The question as to whether an act done or omitted with intent to commit an offence against this Act is or is not only preparation for the commission of that offence, and too remote to constitute an attempt to commit it, is a question of law.
    
    (3) An act done or omitted with intent to commit an offence against this Act may constitute an attempt if it is immediately or proximately connected with the intended offence, whether or not there was any act unequivocally showing intent to commit that offence.

    (3) No person subject to this Act who is married or in a civil union and whose spouse or civil union partner has been a party to an offence becomes an accessory after the fact to that offence by doing any act to which this section applies in order to enable the spouse or civil union partner (or the spouse, civil union partner, and any other person who has been a party to the offence) to escape after arrest or to avoid arrest or conviction.

#### Transitional provisions

##### 82 Continuation of proceedings under Part 5
    
*   (1) All investigations and proceedings under [Part 5][140] of the principal Act that have been commenced before the commencement of this section and that have not been completed before that commencement are to be continued and completed as if this Act had not been enacted.
    
    (2) However, if, in the course of proceedings continued under subsection (1) and after the commencement of this section, an accused elects to be tried by court-martial and does not withdraw that election in the prescribed manner, or is otherwise remanded for trial by court-martial,---

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Armed Forces Discipline Act 1971\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 July 2013, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][587] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][588] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][589] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][590] and [17E][591] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
