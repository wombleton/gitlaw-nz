*   #### Preamble
    
    WHEREAS the Ashburton County Council has from time to time declared the whole (or major part) of the Ashburton County to be a water-race district under the provisions of The Water-supply Act 1908: And whereas the Tinwald Town District does not form part of the said Ashburton County: And whereas a certain stream commonly called the Lagmhor Creek flows partly through the said Ashburton Water-race District and partly through the Tinwald Town District: And whereas such Lagmhor Creek has always been treated by the Ashburton County Council having control over the Ashburton Water-race District as an integral part of the said Ashburton water-race system, and the said Ashburton County Council has for some time past exercised powers over the said Lagmhor Creek above and below the Town of Tinwald, and has also, with the consent of the Tinwald Town Board, exercised certain powers over the said Lagmhor Creek within the said Tinwald Town District: And whereas it is deemed desirable both by the Ashburton County Council and the Tinwald Town Board that the Ashburton County Council should be enabled to exercise full and unrestricted power and control over the said Lagmhor Creek and its branches and diversions within the area of the Tinwald Town District: And whereas the Tinwald Town Board is agreeable and has consented to the said Lagmhor Creek, its branches and diversions, flowing through the Tinwald Town District being placed under the full control of the Ashburton County Council as a water-race and part of the Ashburton water-race system:

BE IT THEREFORE ENACTED by the General Assembly of New Zealand in Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:---
