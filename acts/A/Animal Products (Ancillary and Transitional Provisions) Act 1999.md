    *   (a) that fact must be noted in the contract; and
    
    *   (b) the contract must identify the kinds of fees, charges, and levies under the [Animal Products Act 1999][119] that are to apply in respect of the plant's operations under the Meat Act 1981; and
    
    *   (c) the contract must specify any modifications that may be necessary to allow for the proper application of those fees, charges, or levies (such as deeming services provided by the Ministry under the Meat Act 1981 to be equivalent to verification or other services or related functions performed by the Ministry under the [Animal Products Act 1999][119]); and
    
    *   (d) the contract then has effect according to its tenor, and the fees, charges, and levies concerned (including any amendments of those fees, charges, and levies) apply in relation to the plant (with the necessary modifications) as if it were subject to the cost recovery provisions of the [Animal Products Act 1999][119].

    *   (b) the contract must identify the kinds of fees, charges, and levies that are not to be recovered under the [Animal Products Act 1999][119] and are instead to be recovered under the contract; and
    
    *   (c) the plant manager, and any relevant operation at the plant, are to be treated as exempt from any requirement for the payment of the identified fees, charges, and levies under the [Animal Products Act 1999][119].
    
    (5) For the purpose of facilitating agreement under this section, the Director-General must notify the 2 options set out in subsection (2) to any person who applies for registration of a risk management programme that will cover operations at a double-regime plant, and give the applicant (or plant manager, if different) at least 20 working days within which to specify which option the applicant prefers (if any).
    
    (6) If the Director-General and the plant manager fail to agree on an option set out in subsection (2) within such time after the expiry of the period of 20 working days as the Director-General may allow,---

    *   (b) the 2 separate cost recovery regimes relate to the operations subject to them at the plant concerned according to their tenor.
    
    (7) The provisions of a contract to which this section relates may at any time be modified, or reversed to change to the other cost recovery regime, by agreement between the Director-General and the plant manager.
    
    (8) This section ceases to apply to any plant, and the cost recovery regime of the [Animal Products Act 1999][119] applies to the whole animal product business at the plant,---
        
    *   (a) at the end of the season in which all operations at the plant have ceased to be subject to the Meat Act regime; or
    
    *   (b) on the relevant transition date fixed under [section 9][14] for animal product businesses of that class (or the latest relevant transition date, if more than 1 applies to the business); or
    
    *   (c) on such other date as may be specified by regulations made under [Part 9][153] of the Animal Products Act 1999 or [section 25][39] of this Act.
    
    (9) Regulations made under [section 25][39] may provide for matters relating to the application of a single cost recovery regime to all the animal product business at any double-regime plant, and in particular may---
        
    *   (a) specify the kinds of fees, charges, and levies under the [Animal Products Act 1999][119] that may apply to a plant under the Meat Act regime, and any modifications that may be necessary to allow for the application of those fees, charges, and levies to a Meat Act regime plant in an appropriate way:
    
    *   (b) provide for such other matters as may be necessary or desirable to allow the smooth working of a single cost recovery regime for the purposes of this section.
    
    Section 24(8)(b): substituted, on 26 September 2002, by [section 12][155] of the Animal Products (Ancillary and Transitional Provisions) Amendment Act 2002 (2002 No 30).

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Animal Products (Ancillary and Transitional Provisions) Act 1999\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 June 2005, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that have yet to come into force or that contain relevant transitional or savings provisions are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order.

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][192] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][193] and [17E][194] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   "omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   "typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   "layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   "indentation
        *   "position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   "format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   "format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   "position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   "punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   "Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   "case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   "format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   "small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   "schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   "running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   "format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
