## Schedule  
Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption

[s 2][3]

The States signatory to the present Convention,

Recognizing that the child, for the full and harmonious development of his or her personality, should grow up in a family environment, in an atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding,

Recalling that each State should take, as a matter of priority, appropriate measures to enable the child to remain in the care of his or her family of origin,

Recognizing that intercountry adoption may offer the advantage of a permanent family to a child for whom a suitable family cannot be found in his or her State of origin,

Convinced of the necessity to take measures to ensure that intercountry adoptions are made in the best interests of the child and with respect for his or her fundamental rights, and to prevent the abduction, the sale of, or traffic in children,

Desiring to establish common provisions to this effect, taking into account the principles set forth in international instruments, in particular the _United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child_, of 20 November 1989, and the United Nations Declaration on Social and Legal Principles relating to the Protection and Welfare of Children, with Special Reference to Foster Placement and Adoption Nationally and Internationally (General Assembly Resolution 41/85, of 3 December 1986),

Have agreed upon the following provisions---

## Chapter 1  
Scope of the Convention

The objects of the present Convention are---
    
*   _a_ to establish safeguards to ensure that intercountry adoptions take place in the best interests of the child and with respect for his or her fundamental rights as recognized in international law;

*   _b_ to establish a system of co-operation amongst Contracting States to ensure that those safeguards are respected and thereby prevent the abduction, the sale of, or traffic in children;

*   _c_ to secure the recognition in Contracting States of adoptions made in accordance with the Convention.

### Article 2
    
*   1 The Convention shall apply where a child habitually resident in one Contracting State ('the State of origin') has been, is being, or is to be moved to another Contracting State ('the receiving State') either after his or her adoption in the State of origin by spouses or a person habitually resident in the receiving State, or for the purposes of such an adoption in the receiving State or in the State of origin.

*   2 The Convention covers only adoptions which create a permanent parent-child relationship.

### Article 3

The Convention ceases to apply if the agreements mentioned in Article 17, sub-paragraph _c_, have not been given before the child attains the age of eighteen years.

## Chapter II  
Requirements for intercountry adoptions

### Article 4

An adoption within the scope of the Convention shall take place only if the competent authorities of the State of origin---
    
*   _a_ have established that the child is adoptable;

*   _b_ have determined, after possibilities for placement of the child within the State of origin have been given due consideration, that an intercountry adoption is in the child's best interests;

*   _c_ have ensured that
        
    *   (1) the persons, institutions and authorities whose consent is necessary for adoption, have been counselled as may be necessary and duly informed of the effects of their consent, in particular whether or not an adoption will result in the termination of the legal relationship between the child and his or her family of origin,
    
    *   (2) such persons, institutions and authorities have given their consent freely, in the required legal form, and expressed or evidenced in writing,
    
    *   (3) the consents have not been induced by payment or compensation of any kind and have not been withdrawn, and
    
    *   (4) the consent of the mother, where required, has been given only after the birth of the child; and

    *   (2) consideration has been given to the child's wishes and opinions,
    
    *   (3) the child's consent to the adoption, where such consent is required, has been given freely, in the required legal form, and expressed or evidenced in writing, and
    
    *   (4) such consent has not been induced by payment or compensation of any kind.

This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.

        *   "position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   "format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
