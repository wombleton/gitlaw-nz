## Part 1  
Preliminary provisions and transfer of employees

##### 4 Interpretation
    
*   In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,---
    
    _responsible department_ means the department of State that is, with the authority of the Prime Minister, for the time being responsible for the administration of the Archives Act 1957
    
    _responsible ministry_ means the department of State that is, with the authority of the Prime Minister, for the time being responsible for the administration of the [Arts Council of New Zealand Toi Aotearoa Act 2014][23]
    
    _transferred employee_ means a person employed in the Department of Internal Affairs immediately before the commencement of this Act who is transferred to the responsible department under [section 5][6].
    
    Section 4 **responsible ministry**: amended, on 30 April 2014, by [section 27][24] of the Arts Council of New Zealand Toi Aotearoa Act 2014 (2014 No 1).

##### 5 Transfer of employees
    
*   (1) Every person who is employed in the Department of Internal Affairs immediately before the date of commencement of this Act must be treated as having transferred to the responsible department on that date of commencement if---
        
    *   (a) the person is carrying out duties that on or after that date are to be carried out, in whole or in part, by the responsible department; and
    
    *   (b) the person's transfer to the responsible department is agreed between the chief executive of the Department of Internal Affairs and the chief executive of the responsible department.
    
    (2) The transfer of any employee by this section is subject to any relevant transfer provisions of the employment contract applying to that employee.
    
    Compare: 1998 No 106 [s 3][25]; 1999 No 76 [s 3][26]; 2000 No 14 [s 32][27]

##### 6 Protection of terms and conditions for transferred employee
    
*   (1) The employment of a transferred employee must be on terms and conditions no less favourable than those applying to the employee immediately before the date of the person's transfer to the responsible department.
    
    (2) Subsection (1)---
        
    *   (a) continues to apply to the terms and conditions of employment of a transferred employee until those terms and conditions are varied by agreement between the transferred employee and the responsible department; but
    
    *   (b) does not apply to a transferred employee who, after the transfer, receives any subsequent appointment within the responsible department.
    
    Compare: 1998 No 106 [s 4][28]; 1999 No 76 [s 4][29]; 2000 No 14 [s 33][30]

##### 7 Employment to be continuous
    
*   For the purposes of any provisions of a transferred employee's employment contract relating to continuity of service, that employee's transfer from the Department of Internal Affairs to the responsible department is insufficient by itself to break his or her employment.
    
    Compare: 1998 No 96 [s 4][31]; 1999 No 76 [s 5][32]; 1999 No 82 [s 5][33]

##### 8 No compensation for technical redundancy
    
*   A transferred employee is not entitled to receive any compensation for redundancy or any severance payment solely on the ground that---
        
    *   (a) the position held by that employee in the Department of Internal Affairs has ceased to exist; or
    
    *   (b) the person has ceased to be an employee of the Department of Internal Affairs as a result of his or her transfer to the responsible department.
    
    Compare: 1998 No 96 [s 5][34]; 1998 No 106 [s 7][35]; 1999 No 76 [s 7][36]; 2000 No 14 [s 35][37]

## Part 2  
Transfer of obligations and functions, and other related matters

##### 9 Transfer of contracts or leases not to give rise to claims
    
*   (1) No person has any claim against the Crown for breach of any contract merely because the administration of the contract, or the benefit or burden of the contract, is transferred (in whole or in part) to the responsible department or the responsible ministry, whether that transfer takes place before, on, or after the commencement of this Act.
    
    (2) Subsection (1) applies---
        
    *   (a) whether or not the person has agreed to the transfer; and
    
    *   (b) whether or not the transfer involves the responsible department or the responsible ministry (and its employees) gaining access to any information, data, programme, intellectual property right, know-how, chattel, equipment, transmission device, or facility of the claimant or any other person.
    
    (3) No person has any claim against the Crown for breach of any lease of any premises that are, or are to be, occupied or administered (in whole or in part) by the responsible department or the responsible ministry merely because of that occupation or administration of the premises by the responsible department or the responsible ministry.
    
    (4) Subsection (3) applies whether or not the person has agreed to the occupation or administration of the premises by the responsible department or the responsible ministry.
    
    Compare: 1998 No 96 [s 6][38]; 1999 No 82 [s 7][39]

##### 10 References to functions being transferred to responsible department or responsible ministry

    (2) Every reference to the Secretary for Internal Affairs, when used in relation to the National Archives, is a reference to the chief executive of the responsible department.
    
    (3) Every reference to the Secretary for Internal Affairs, when used in relation to the Heritage Property Unit, Historical Branch of the Department of Internal Affairs, or the Dictionary of New Zealand Biography, is a reference to the chief executive of the responsible ministry.
    
    Compare: 1998 No 96 [s 10][40]; 1999 No 82 [s 11][41]

##### 11 Savings relating to brands, logos, marks, etc

    *   (a) continue to have effect in relation to anything done before that date; and
    
    *   (b) may continue to be used, and are to have effect, for the purposes of the functions, duties, and powers of the responsible department or the responsible ministry, as the case may be.
