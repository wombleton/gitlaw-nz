    (11) The holder of the lease or licence must not begin farming the species of fish, aquatic life, or seaweed referred to in subsection (10)(b) if doing so would have, or is likely to have, effects that are more adverse in character, intensity, or scale than the effects of farming the species of fish, aquatic life, or seaweed that the lease or licence applied to immediately before the variation.
    
    (12) However, subsection (11) does not apply if the holder of the lease or licence is authorised to farm the species of fish, aquatic life, or seaweed concerned by---

*   18 Unless the Waikato Regional Council agrees to an earlier release, the consent holder shall maintain the bond in favour of the Waikato Regional Council until two (2) years after the expiry of this resource consent. Where the consent holder has applied to the Waikato Regional Council pursuant to section 165ZH of the Resource Management Act 1991 to replace this resource consent, the consent holder shall maintain the bond in favour of the Waikato Regional Council until one (1) year after the decision and any subsequent appeals on that decision.

*   19 The bond shall be in a form approved by the Waikato Regional Council and shall be on the terms required by the Waikato Regional Council.

The guarantor shall bind itself to pay for, or undertake, the work necessary for the carrying out and completion of any works to ensure compliance with condition \[13\] in the event of any default of the consent holder. Alternatively, the bond requirement may be met by a legally enforceable industry pooled fund and/or security scheme which has been approved by the WRC.

*   20 Within 2 months after the commencement of the Aquaculture Reform (Repeals and Transitional Provisions) Amendment Act 2011, the consent holder shall propose a bond quantum for the Waikato Regional Council's consideration. The bond shall be fixed by the Waikato Regional Council after taking into account any calculations or other matters submitted by the consent holder which are relevant to the determination of the bond quantum.

*   21 The bond shall make provision so that every third year, beginning 1 March 2014, the quantum of the bond shall be adjusted for inflation.

*   22 The bond may be varied or cancelled at any time by agreement in writing between the consent holder and the Waikato Regional Council.

*   Note: The Waikato Regional Council may include in any written agreement cancelling the bond a stipulation that the requirement for the bond shall be reinstated at any time if it is deemed necessary by the Waikato Regional Council following consultation with the consent holder.

*   23 The transfer of this resource consent is subject to the transferee providing a bond on the same terms as the existing bond, unless this requirement is provided for by an industry security scheme approved by the Waikato Regional Council. In the case of any transfer in part or in whole to another person, the bond lodged by the transferor shall be retained until any outstanding work at the date of transfer is completed to ensure compliance with condition \[13\] of this resource consent.

*   Note: The Waikato Regional Council will not unreasonably retain the bond if it is satisfied that adequate or alternative provisions have been made in this regard.

*   24 The consent holder shall pay all reasonable costs incurred by the Waikato Regional Council in relation to the preparation, administration and execution of the bond.

*   25 The Waikato Regional Council may, within two (2) months either side of 1 March 2012, and at five yearly periods thereafter, serve notice on the consent holder under section 128(1) of the Resource Management Act 1991, of its intention to review the conditions of this resource consent.
