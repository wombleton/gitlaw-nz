An Act to enable A.E. Thorpe Limited to be incorporated in Australia, to provide that, on its incorporation, the company shall cease to be incorporated under the Companies Act 1955, and to make provision for incidental matters
* #### Preamble
  
  Whereas
    * AA.E. Thorpe Limited (hereinafter referred to as **the Company**) is a company formed and registered under the Companies Act 1955 as a company limited by shares:
    * Bthe Company is a private company within the meaning of section 2(1) of the Companies Act 1955:

    * Ethe Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Oakbridge Limited, a company incorporated under the laws of the State of New South Wales having its registered office at Level 9, 100 Christie Street, St Leonards, New South Wales:
    * Fbefore becoming a subsidiary of Oakbridge Limited the Company was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Elders Resources NZFP Limited, a company incorporated under the New Zealand Companies Act 1933:
    * Gthe Company owns or controls all the shares in the capital of The Newcastle Wallsend Coal Company Pty Limited and of Saxonvale Coal Pty Limited, both of which are companies incorporated under the laws of the State of New South Wales:
    * Hhaving regard to the fact that the only function of the Company is to be the holding company, within the meaning of section 158 of the Companies Act 1955, of companies that are incorporated in Australia, that the Company owns no assets of substance in New Zealand, and that the Company is itself a wholly-owned subsidiary of a company incorporated in Australia, it is considered expedient and advantageous for the Company to be incorporated under any laws of the Commonwealth of Australia or of a State or Territory of the Commonwealth of Australia that permit its incorporation instead of under the Companies Act 1955:
    * Ino procedure exists for a company that is incorporated under the Companies Act 1955 to become incorporated under the laws of another country or the State or Territory of another country:
    * Jthe winding-up and dissolution of the Company and the transfer or sale of its assets to a company incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Australia or of a State or Territory of the Commonwealth of Australia would result in the Company losing its corporate identity, disturb the financial structure of the Company and that of the group of companies of which it is a member, and would involve significant expense:
    * Kit is desirable that the Company be enabled to become a company incorporated under any laws of the Commonwealth of Australia or of a State or Territory of the Commonwealth of Australia that permit its incorporation without the loss of its corporate identity and disturbance to its financial structure and that of the group of companies of which it is a member:
    * Lthe objects of this Act cannot be attained without the authority of Parliament.

###### 2Status of reprints

###### 4Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
* [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][12] and [17E][13] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
  
  A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
  
  In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
    * "omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    * "typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    * "layout of provisions, including:
          * "indentation
          * "position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
    * "format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    * "format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    * "position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    * "punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    * "Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    * "case and appearance of letters and words, including:
          * "format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
          * "small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
    * "schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
