An Act to enable A.E. Thorpe Limited to be incorporated in Australia, to provide that, on its incorporation, the company shall cease to be incorporated under the Companies Act 1955, and to make provision for incidental matters

</div>
*   #### Preamble

    <div id="DLM114563" lang="en-NZ" class="preamble-block">

    Whereas

    *   <span class="label">A</span>A.E. Thorpe Limited (hereinafter referred to as**the Company**) is a company formed and registered under the Companies Act 1955 as a company limited by shares:

    *   <span class="label">B</span>the Company is a private company within the meaning of section 2(1) of the Companies Act 1955:

    *   <span class="label">C</span>the Company was incorporated in Auckland on 3 September 1956 and has a nominal capital of $100,000 divided into 50,000 shares of $2 each:

    *   <span class="label">D</span>the registered office of the Company is at Europa House, 109117 Featherston Street, Wellington, New Zealand:

    *   <span class="label">E</span>the Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Oakbridge Limited, a company incorporated under the laws of the State of New South Wales having its registered office at Level 9, 100 Christie Street, St Leonards, New South Wales:

    *   <span class="label">F</span>before becoming a subsidiary of Oakbridge Limited the Company was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Elders Resources NZFP Limited, a company incorporated under the New Zealand Companies Act 1933:

    *   <span class="label">G</span>the Company owns or controls all the shares in the capital of The Newcastle Wallsend Coal Company Pty Limited and of Saxonvale Coal Pty Limited, both of which are companies incorporated under the laws of the State of New South Wales:

    *   <span class="label">H</span>having regard to the fact that the only function of the Company is to be the holding company, within the meaning of section 158 of the Companies Act 1955, of companies that are incorporated in Australia, that the Company owns no assets of substance in New Zealand, and that the Company is itself a wholly-owned subsidiary of a company incorporated in Australia, it is considered expedient and advantageous for the Company to be incorporated under any laws of the Commonwealth of Australia or of a State or Territory of the Commonwealth of Australia that permit its incorporation instead of under the Companies Act 1955:

    *   <span class="label">I</span>no procedure exists for a company that is incorporated under the Companies Act 1955 to become incorporated under the laws of another country or the State or Territory of another country:

    *   <span class="label">J</span>the winding-up and dissolution of the Company and the transfer or sale of its assets to a company incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Australia or of a State or Territory of the Commonwealth of Australia would result in the Company losing its corporate identity, disturb the financial structure of the Company and that of the group of companies of which it is a member, and would involve significant expense:

    *   <span class="label">K</span>it is desirable that the Company be enabled to become a company incorporated under any laws of the Commonwealth of Australia or of a State or Territory of the Commonwealth of Australia that permit its incorporation without the loss of its corporate identity and disturbance to its financial structure and that of the group of companies of which it is a member:

    *   <span class="label">L</span>the objects of this Act cannot be attained without the authority of Parliament.

###### <span class="label">2</span>Status of reprints

*   Under[section 16D](/act/private/1990/0003/latest/link.aspx?id=DLM195439) of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by[section 17C](/act/private/1990/0003/latest/link.aspx?id=DLM195466) of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.

    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

</div><div class="reprint-note">
###### <span class="label">3</span>How reprints are prepared

*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions,_see_[http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/](http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ )![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the_Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

</div><div class="reprint-note">
###### <span class="label">4</span>Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989

*   [Section 17C](/act/private/1990/0003/latest/link.aspx?id=DLM195466) of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in[sections 17D](/act/private/1990/0003/latest/link.aspx?id=DLM195468) and[17E](/act/private/1990/0003/latest/link.aspx?id=DLM195470) of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.

    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by[section 17C](/act/private/1990/0003/latest/link.aspx?id=DLM195466) of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.

    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of[section 17C](/act/private/1990/0003/latest/link.aspx?id=DLM195466) of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:

    *   <span class="label">"</span>omission of unnecessary referential words (such as<q class="quote-in"><span class="q"></span>of this section<span class="q"></span></q> and<q class="quote-in"><span class="q"></span>of this Act<span class="q"></span></q>)

    *   <span class="label">"</span>typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)

    *   <span class="label">"</span>layout of provisions, including:

        *   <span class="label">"</span>indentation

        *   <span class="label">"</span>position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)

    *   <span class="label">"</span>format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)

    *   <span class="label">"</span>format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as<q class="quote-in"><span class="q"></span>the 1st day of January 1999<span class="q"></span></q> is now expressed as<q class="quote-in"><span class="q"></span>1 January 1999<span class="q"></span></q>)

    *   <span class="label">"</span>position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)

    *   <span class="label">"</span>punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)

    *   <span class="label">"</span>Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly

    *   <span class="label">"</span>case and appearance of letters and words, including:

        *   <span class="label">"</span>format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)

        *   <span class="label">"</span>small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters

    *   <span class="label">"</span>schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
