An Act to provide for the winding up and dissolution of certain Automobile Associations and the merging of their interests and the vesting of their assets in the Automobile Association (Central) Incorporated
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    Whereas for the strengthening and advancement of the Automobile Association movement in New Zealand it has been agreed by and between the Automobile Association (Wellington) Incorporated (hereinafter called AA Wellington), the Automobile Association (Hawke's Bay) Incorporated (hereinafter called AA Hawke's Bay), and the Automobile Association (Manawatu) Incorporated (hereinafter called AA Manawatu) (all being duly incorporated societies having their registered offices at Wellington, Napier, and Palmerston North respectively) that they would, as from 1 September 1980, cease to function as separately incorporated associations and instead form one association in which their respective memberships, assets, interests, and activities would be merged and with which other Automobile Associations in New Zealand would similarly be able to merge should they in the future desire so to do: And whereas pursuant to the said agreement it has been further agreed by and between the 3 said Associations first, that AA Wellington alter its name to the Automobile Association (Central) Incorporated and alter its rules to provide appropriately for the constitution and operation of that Association following the merger, such alterations to take effect on 1 September 1980 and, secondly, that on and after 1 September 1980 AA Hawke's Bay and AA Manawatu be wound up voluntarily, their members then becoming members of AA Central, and their assets transferred to AA Central: And whereas in furtherance of the said agreements, AA Wellington by resolution of its members in general meeting on 29 October 1979 resolved to alter its name to the Automobile Association (Central) Incorporated and to alter its rules to provide for the merger as aforesaid, such alterations to take effect on 1 September 1980: And whereas in furtherance of the said agreements AA Hawke's Bay by resolution of its members in general meeting on 13 November 1979 approved the proposed merger with AA Central and the vesting of its assets in AA Central on and after 1 September 1980 and in order to give effect thereto resolved pursuant to [section 24(1)][11] of the Incorporated Societies Act 1908 that the Association be wound up voluntarily and that resolution was confirmed at a subsequent general meeting called together for that purpose on 18 December 1979: And whereas in furtherance of the said agreements AA Manawatu by resolution of its members on 19 November 1979 resolved that the Association be wound up on 31 August 1980 for the purposes of the said merger and that the Association's assets be then transferred to AA Central and that resolution was confirmed at a subsequent general meeting called together for the purpose on 4 January 1980: And whereas neither AA Hawke's Bay nor AA Manawatu has complied with those provisions of the Companies Act 1955 which are applicable to the winding up of an incorporated society by virtue of [section 24(2)][11] of the Incorporated Societies Act 1908 and [regulation 8(3)][12] of the Incorporated Societies Regulations 1979: And whereas it is appropriate that the windings up of AA Hawke's Bay and AA Manawatu should be deemed not to commence until 1 September 1980: And whereas it is provided by the rules of AA Hawke's Bay that upon the winding up of that Association all surplus assets shall be transferred to an association having substantially similar objects to those for which that Association was established and in such manner and on such conditions as the members of the Association in general meeting may determine: And whereas it is provided by the rules of AA Manawatu that upon the winding up of that Association for the purposes of merger with another Automobile Association the property and assets of the Association may be transferred to that other Association: And whereas the members of both AA Hawke's Bay and AA Manawatu having resolved that the assets of their respective Associations should be transferred to AA Central and it being undesirable for there to be any realisation of those assets except as may seem appropriate to AA Central, it is desired to provide for the vesting of those assets in AA Central upon AA Central assuming responsibility for all debts and liabilities of those Associations: And whereas it is desirable to make provision for the eventuality that another Automobile Association or other Automobile Associations in New Zealand may desire to merge with AA Central: And whereas the merger of AA Wellington, AA Hawke's Bay, and AA Manawatu cannot be attained otherwise than by legislation: And whereas a true merger of AA Central and any other Automobile Association without the other Association being wound up cannot be attained otherwise than by legislation.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Automobile Association (Central) Act 1980\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 16 December 1980, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][16] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][17] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][18] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][19] and [17E][20] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
