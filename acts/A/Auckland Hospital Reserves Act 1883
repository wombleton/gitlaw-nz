*   #### Preamble
    
    WHEREAS, under a Provincial Ordinance of Auckland, intituled The [Public Buildings Act 1875][10], certain Commissioners were appointed for the purposes of the said Act, and under an Act of the General Assembly, intituled The [Auckland Public Buildings Act 1876][11], five other Commissioners were appointed in the place of the Commissioners first aforesaid, and power was granted to the Governor in Council from time to time to appoint Commissioners in the case of any vacancy among any Commissioners for the time being in office:
    
    And whereas, after the passing of the Act last named, the five Commissioners aforesaid vacated their offices, and the Governor in Council from time to time has appointed other Commissioners in their places, but the persons so appointed have been two in number instead of five, and it is expedient to validate all such appointments:
    
    And whereas, under the Act hereinabove first named, certain lands described in the [Schedule][9] hereto were charged as a security for the repayment of a loan authorized by the said Act to be raised and applied towards the construction of a new hospital at Auckland, and provision was made for the creation, out of the rents and profits of such lands, of a sinking fund for the repayment of such loan, and accumulations of such rents and profits have arisen in surplus of the amount required to be paid into a sinking fund as aforesaid year by year, and it is expedient to release such surplus, to be applied as hereinafter mentioned:
    
    And whereas the parcel of land first described in the [Schedule][9] hereto may be leased for a period not exceeding ninety-nine years under The Supreme Court Site Leasing Act 1875, of the former Province of Auckland:
    
    And whereas the remainder of the aforesaid lands form part of certain lands described in Schedule A to an Act of the General Assembly, intituled The Auckland Hospital and Grammar School Reserves Act 1856, which, under the Act last named, were vested in the Superintendent of the former Province of Auckland, to be held as if granted to him as public reserves under The Public Reserves Act 1854, upon trust for the site of, or for an endowment for, or towards the maintenance and support of, a hospital:
    
    And whereas, under a Provincial Ordinance, intituled The Auckland Reserves Act 1858, the Superintendent aforesaid was authorized to lease any of the last mentioned lands for a period not exceeding twenty-one years:
