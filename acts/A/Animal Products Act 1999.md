## Part 1  
Preliminary provisions

##### 2 Object of Act
    
*   The object of this Act is to---
        
    *   (a) minimise and manage risks to human or animal health arising from the production and processing of animal material and products by instituting measures that ensure so far as is practicable that all traded animal products are fit for their intended purpose; and
    
    *   (b) facilitate the entry of animal material and products into overseas markets by providing the controls and mechanisms needed to give and to safeguard official assurances for entry into those markets.
    
    

##### 3 General scheme of Act
    
*   (1) In general terms, this Act seeks to achieve its objects by the following means:
        
    *   (a) _Individual risk management programmes_
        
        [Part 2][15] generally requires all primary processors of animal material and products, and certain secondary processors of animal products for human or animal consumption, to operate under registered and independently verified risk management programmes suitable to their own particular animal material, products, and operations, unless and to the extent that such a programme is deemed unnecessary by reason of---
            
        *   (i) the negligible degree of risk associated with the relevant animal material, product, operations, or intended product use; or
        
        *   (ii) the fact that the animal material or product and operations concerned are covered by another legislative regime.
        
        Provision is also made for other persons involved with animal material or products to operate under risk management programmes where the risk factors involved, or the requirements of overseas markets, justify such a requirement:
    
    *   (b) _Regulated control schemes_
        
        [Part 3][47] makes provision for the imposition of regulated control schemes in the case of animal material or products or matters for which individually tailored risk management programmes are impracticable or inappropriate. These schemes may be an alternative or a supplement to individual risk management programmes:
    
    *   (c) _Animal product standards_
        
        [Part 4][53] provides for the setting of animal product standards that set criteria that must be met for particular animal products to be treated as fit for their intended purpose (whether or not those products are also produced under an individual risk management programme or a regulated control scheme), and for the setting of any technical specifications required to meet those standards:
    
    *   (d) _Exports of animal material and products_
        
        [Part 5][59] makes special provision in relation to the export of animal material and products from New Zealand, by---

## Part 2  
Risk management programmes

##### 11 Object of this Part
    
*   The object of this Part is to provide, as the main means for ensuring that animal products are fit for their intended purpose, for the production and processing of certain animal materials and products to occur under 1 or more registered risk management programmes that are subject to independent verification.

##### 12 What is a risk management programme?
    
*   (1) A risk management programme is a programme designed to both---
        
    *   (a) identify; and
    
    *   (b) control, manage, and eliminate or minimise---
    
    hazards and other risk factors in relation to the production and processing of animal material and animal products in order to ensure that the resulting animal product is fit for intended purpose.
    
    (2) Risk factors may relate to the nature of the animal material or product concerned, or to the production, processing, preparation, distribution, trade, or intended use of the animal material or product.
    
    (3) Risk management programmes are to be individually tailored for each animal product business, having regard to---
        
    *   (a) each type of animal material and animal product that the business produces or processes; and
    
    *   (b) each type of process or operation that is applied to the animal material or product; and
    
    *   (c) each set of premises or place in which the animal material or product is produced or processed.
    
    (3A) Nothing in subsection (3) prevents a risk management programme for a particular business or part of a business from being based on a template, a model, or a code of practice, if in the view of the Director-General the template, model, or code of practice is valid and appropriate for businesses of that kind.
    
    (4) A risk management programme for each type of animal material or product, each type of process or operation, and each set of premises or place may be formulated as a single stand-alone programme, or may form part of a larger risk management programme that applies to 1 or more materials, products, processes, operations, places, or premises within the same business or operation.
    
    (4A) A risk management programme may also apply to 1 or more comparable animal product businesses in cases where the Director-General has given approval under [section 17A][23].
    
    (5) A food safety programme may be registered as a risk management programme in accordance with [section 34][43].

    *   (a) such a person should be aware of the implications of not having a programme as set out in [section 33][42]; and
    
    *   (b) if the person elects under [section 32][41] to operate under a registered risk management programme, or to register a food safety programme as a risk management programme under [section 34][43] for the purposes of certain operations, they will be treated as a person who is required to have a registered risk management programme in respect of the animal products or operations concerned.

    (2) The Director-General may impose conditions and requirements in respect of the implementation and operation of a suspension under this section.
    
    (3) Where the Director-General suspends all or any operations under a risk management programme, he or she must give written notice of that fact to the operator of the programme, specifying---
        
    *   (a) the reason for the suspension; and
    
    *   (b) the period of the suspension; and
    
    *   (c) the date on which or time at which it commences (which may not be earlier than the date or time of notification); and
    
    *   (d) the operations to which the suspension applies; and
    
    *   (e) any conditions or requirements in relation to the suspension.
    
    (4) If the Director-General considers it necessary in the circumstances, and after having notified the operator of the proposed extension and the reasons for it and having given the operator a reasonable opportunity to be heard, the period of suspension may be extended for such further period not exceeding 3 months as the Director-General notifies to the operator in writing before the expiry of the original suspension.
    
    (5) The Director-General must notify the appropriate recognised risk management programme verifying agency of any suspension under this section.
    
    (6) The Director-General may notify any suspension under this section in the _Gazette_.
    
    (7) A suspension under this section does not affect any other actions that the Director-General may take under this Act.
    
    (8) Where operations are suspended under this section, the Director-General may direct the operator or person in charge to take action appropriate to deal with any affected animal material or product and exercise any of his or her other powers under [section 82][121].
    
    (9) If a person acting under the delegated authority of the Director-General suspends any operations under this section, the operator of the risk management programme or of the animal product business concerned may seek a review of the suspension under [section 162][249].
    
    Section 27(5): amended, on 26 September 2002, by [section 5(10)][267] of the Animal Products Amendment Act 2002 (2002 No 29).

##### 28 Deregistration of risk management programme
    
*   (1) The Director-General may at any time remove a risk management programme from the register if the Director-General is satisfied that---
        
    *   (a) the Director-General would be justified under [section 27][34] in suspending operations under the programme but, in light of repeated suspensions of operations under the risk management programme in the past under that section, it would be more appropriate to deregister the programme; or
    
    *   (b) there is or has been such a serious failure of operations or other matters under the programme as to cast doubt on the fitness for intended purpose of the animal product produced under the programme; or
    
    *   (c) whether by reason of the passage of time, changing circumstances, or for any other reason, the risk management programme no longer ensures the fitness for intended purpose of animal product produced under the programme; or
    
    *   (d) the operator of the programme is no longer a fit and proper person to operate or be responsible for the operation of an animal product business, taking into account any conviction of the operator or any director or manager of the animal product business concerned, whether in New Zealand or overseas, of any offence relating to fraud or dishonesty, or relating to management control or business activities in respect of businesses of a kind (whether in New Zealand or elsewhere) that are regulated under this Act; or
    
    *   (e) the risk management programme has ceased to be relevant to the operations it purports to cover by reason of there being a change in the identity of---
            
        *   (i) the person who owns or has control of the business concerned; or
        
        *   (ii) the premises or place where the relevant operations are carried out; or
        
        *   (iii) the material or product being produced or processed; or
        
        *   (iv) the type of production or processing being carried out.
        
        
    
    (2) The Director-General may not deregister a risk management programme under this section unless he or she has first---
        
    *   (a) notified the operator of the programme (whether orally or in writing) of the intention to deregister and the reason for deregistration; and
    
    *   (b) given the operator an opportunity to be heard.
    
    (3) Where the Director-General determines to deregister a risk management programme, the Director-General must---
        
    *   (a) give written notice of that fact to the operator of the programme, giving reasons and specifying the date on which the deregistration takes effect (which may not be earlier than the date of notification); and
    
    *   (b) notify the appropriate recognised risk management programme verifying agency of that fact.
    
    (4) Where a risk management programme is deregistered under this section, the Director-General may direct the operator or person in charge to take action appropriate to deal with any affected animal material or product and may exercise any of his or her other powers under [section 82][121].
    
    (5) The Director-General may notify any deregistration under this section in the _Gazette_.
    
    (6) The deregistration of a risk management programme under this section does not affect any other actions that the Director-General may take under this Act.
    
    (7) If a person acting under the delegated authority of the Director-General deregisters a risk management programme under this section, the operator of the risk management programme or of the animal product business concerned may seek a review of the deregistration under [section 162][249].
    
    Section 28(1)(c): substituted, on 26 September 2002, by [section 19][312] of the Animal Products Amendment Act 2002 (2002 No 29).
    
    Section 28(3)(b): amended, on 26 September 2002, by [section 5(10)][267] of the Animal Products Amendment Act 2002 (2002 No 29).

##### 28A Removal of animal product business from coverage of wider risk management programme
    
*   (1) The Director-General may at any time remove any animal product business from the coverage of a registered risk management programme that applies to 2 or more comparable businesses if the Director-General is satisfied that deregistration of the programme would be appropriate under [section 28(1)][35] if the animal product business were the only one operating under the programme.
    
    (2) Subsections (2) to (7) of [section 28][35] apply in relation to the removal of the business from the coverage of the risk management programme as if references in these sections to deregistration of the programme were references to removal from the coverage of the programme.
    
    Section 28A: inserted, on 26 September 2002, by [section 20][313] of the Animal Products Amendment Act 2002 (2002 No 29).

##### 29 Surrender of registration
    
*   (1) The operator of a registered risk management programme may at any time surrender registration of the programme by notice in writing to the Director-General.
    
    (2) Where the operator or animal product business concerned ceases to operate as a producer or processor of animal material or animal product, that operator (or, where appropriate, the liquidator, receiver, executor, or other successor in title of the operator) must, within 30 days of so ceasing,---
        
    *   (a) notify the Director-General in writing of that fact; and
    
    *   (b) surrender the notice of registration to the Director-General; and
    
    *   (c) notify the appropriate recognised risk management programme verifying agency of that fact.
    
    (3) At the same time as notification under subsection (1) or subsection (2), the operator or other relevant person must also notify the Director-General of how it is proposed to deal with any remaining animal material or product covered by the risk management programme.
    
    (4) The Director-General may approve or agree to any such proposal, but may also, if appropriate, exercise any of his or her powers under [section 82][121].
    
    (5) On being notified of a surrender under this section,---
        
    *   (a) the Director-General must record the surrender on the register of risk management programmes; and
    
    *   (b) the surrender takes effect from the date stated in the register.
    
    Section 29(2)(c): amended, on 26 September 2002, by [section 5(10)][267] of the Animal Products Amendment Act 2002 (2002 No 29).

##### 30 Risk management programme in conflict with regulations or specifications
    
*   Where there is any conflict between the requirements of a registered risk management programme and those of any regulations or specifications made under this Act, whether by reason of a failure to amend or update the programme to reflect any new requirements or otherwise, the requirements of the regulations or specifications prevail.

#### Relationship between Food Act regime and risk management programmes

##### 31 Object of sections 32 to 34
    
*   The object of [sections 32 to 34][41] is to recognise the general equivalence of food safety programmes and risk management programmes, and to minimise the problems of overlap of 2 separate legislative regimes, by---
        
    *   (a) allowing, in [section 32][41], a secondary processor of an animal product which is a food to elect to operate solely under a risk management programme and this Act, rather than under the equivalent Food Act regime (particularly where the food is for export, and may require official assurances); and
    
    *   (b) providing, in [section 34][43], for the registration of food safety programmes as risk management programmes, and allowing switching between programmes in the case of persons who wish to operate principally under one regime, but may also need or wish to operate from time to time under the other regime in respect of all or part of their operations.
    
    Section 31: amended, on 26 September 2002, by [section 21][315] of the Animal Products Amendment Act 2002 (2002 No 29).

##### 32 Secondary processors of animal products which are food may elect to operate under risk management programme
    
*   (1) A secondary processor of an animal product which is a food within the meaning of the [Food Act 1981][271] may elect under this section to operate under a registered risk management programme rather than under a food safety programme or under the [Food Hygiene Regulations 1974][273] in respect of that product.
    
    (2) An election under this section---
        
    *   (a) is made by notifying it to the Director-General, whether at the time the secondary processor applies for registration of a risk management programme or in such other manner as the Director-General may approve; and
    
    *   (b) takes effect when the risk management programme of the secondary processor is registered, or is notified in the register as taking effect.
    
    (3) [Sections 20 to 23][27] apply in relation to the application for registration of a risk management programme of any person making an election under this section.
    
    (4) Where an election is made under this section,---
        
    *   (a) for the purposes of this Act, the secondary processor is to be treated as a person who is required to have a risk management programme in respect of the animal product concerned; and
    
    *   (b) the Food Act regime does not apply to the matters covered by the registered risk management programme.
    
    (5) An election under this section is to be treated as revoked if the secondary processor surrenders the risk management programme under [section 29][37], and subsection (4) of this section ceases to apply on and from the date stated in the register.
    
    (6) When the Director-General has registered a secondary processor's risk management programme following an election of the processor under this section, the Director-General must---
        
    *   (a) notify the chief executive of the agency for the time being responsible for the administration of the [Food Act 1981][271] and any relevant territorial authority (as defined in [section 8B][316] of the Food Act 1981) of the election; and
    
    *   (b) note the election on the register of risk management programmes in accordance with [section 19][26].
    
    (7) Where an election is treated as revoked by subsection (5), the Director-General must similarly notify the chief executive and relevant territorial authority referred to in subsection (6)(a), and must note the revocation on the register.

##### 33 Implications of failure to elect in case of animal product which is food whose export requires an official assurance
    
*   (1) Where a secondary processor operates under the Food Act regime rather than under a risk management programme in relation to any animal product that is for export, and overseas market access requirements as notified or made available by the Director-General under [section 60][76] apply to that product,---
        
    *   (a) the product must meet the requirements imposed by or under this Act for the giving of official assurances, if any official assurance is to be given under this Act in relation to the product; and
    
    *   (b) if it does not, it cannot be the subject of an official assurance under this Act.
    
    (2) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the secondary processor must operate under either a registered risk management programme or a food safety programme that is registered as a risk management programme in accordance with [section 34][43], and meet such additional requirements as may be notified or made available under [section 60][76].
    
    Section 33(2): amended, on 26 September 2002, by [section 22][317] of the Animal Products Amendment Act 2002 (2002 No 29).

##### 34 Alternate or intermittent use of risk management programmes and food safety programmes
    
*   (1) A secondary processor who wishes to have a food safety programme recognised as a risk management programme to be operated on an intermittent basis may apply to the Director-General for registration of the programme as a risk management programme.
    
    (2) The application must be in a manner approved by the Director-General and be accompanied by the prescribed fee (if any), and [sections 20(2) to 23][27] apply to any such application as if it were an application under section 20(1).
    
    (3) Where a food safety programme is registered as a risk management programme,---
        
    *   (a) its operator may operate under it only at the times and in the manner, and on the giving of such notification, as may be specified in conditions (if any) imposed under [section 22][29]; and
    
    *   (b) during, or in respect of matters occurring during, any period when the operator operates under the programme as a risk management programme,---
            
        *   (i) for the purposes of this Act the operator is to be treated in respect of those operations as a person who is required to have a risk management programme in respect of those operations; and
        
        *   (ii) subject to any regulations made under this section, the Food Act regime does not apply to those operations; and
        
        
    
    *   (c) during, or in respect of matters occurring during any period when the operator does not so operate, the operator is to be treated as subject to the Food Act regime, and, subject to any regulations made under this section, this Part does not apply in relation to that period or matters occurring during it; and
    
    *   (d) despite anything in this Act or the [Food Act 1981][271], the risk management programme is subject to whichever audit or verification regime is specified by the Director-General under subsection (4).
    
    (4) In imposing conditions on registration under [section 22(3)][29], the Director-General---
        
    *   (a) must specify whether and to what extent the programme is to be subject to the verification requirements of this Act or the audit requirements of the [Food Act 1981][271]; and
    
    *   (b) in making such a specification, is to have regard to the desirability of continuity in audit or verification services, functions, or requirements and to any overseas market access requirements notified or made available under [section 60][76]; and
    
    *   (c) may impose such other conditions as are reasonable in light of the operator's proposed use of the programme.
    
    (5) Before registering a food safety programme as a risk management programme, the Director-General must advise the applicant of the conditions of the proposed registration and give the applicant the opportunity to withdraw the application.
    
    (6) On registering a programme, the Director-General must as soon as practicable notify the fact and the conditions of the registration to---
        
    *   (a) the applicant; and
    
    *   (b) the chief executive of the agency for the time being responsible for the administration of the [Food Act 1981][271], or the relevant territorial authority; and
    
    *   (c) the applicant's recognised risk management programme verifying agency (if applicable); and
    
    *   (d) the applicant's approved auditor under the [Food Act 1981][271].
    
    (7) Regulations and specifications made under [sections 166][256] and [167][257] may provide for matters relating to the registration of food safety programmes as risk management programmes under this Act. Such regulations may---
        
    *   (a) specify or set criteria for determining whether all or any 1 or more classes of such programmes are to be subject to the verification regime of this Act or the audit regime of the [Food Act 1981][271]; and
    
    *   (b) exempt persons or provide for their exemption, whether wholly, partially, or conditionally, from compliance with specified requirements imposed by or under either Act, where such exemptions are appropriate in the interests of avoiding unnecessary or undesirable duplication of equivalent duties or matters under the 2 Acts.
    
    Section 34(6)(c): amended, on 26 September 2002, by [section 5(10)][267] of the Animal Products Amendment Act 2002 (2002 No 29).

#### References to recognised risk management programme verifying agency
    
*   Heading: replaced, on 31 August 2012, by [section 6][318] of the Animal Products Amendment Act 2012 (2012 No 59).

##### 35 References to recognised risk management programme verifying agency
    
*   A reference in this Part to a recognised risk management programme verifying agency, in relation to a risk management programme, must be treated as if it were a reference to a recognised risk management programme verifier if a recognised person carries out the verification functions and activities for that programme without being employed or engaged by a recognised agency.
    
    Section 35: replaced, on 31 August 2012, by [section 7][319] of the Animal Products Amendment Act 2012 (2012 No 59).

##### 36 Director-General may require notification by recognised agency of termination of contracts
    
*   \[Repealed\]

## Part 3  
Regulated control schemes

##### 37 Object of this Part
    
*   The object of this Part is to provide for regulated control schemes which are special regulatory regimes to provide for cases where---
        
    *   (a) it is inappropriate or impracticable to manage risk factors under risk management programmes; or
    
    *   (b) risk factors may need to be addressed in relation to the production of animal material or the processing of animal product that is not required by this Act to be covered by a registered risk management programme; or
    
    *   (c) special provision is required for the purposes of overseas market access requirements.
    
    Section 37(a): amended, on 26 September 2002, by [section 5(10)][267] of the Animal Products Amendment Act 2002 (2002 No 29).
    
    Section 37(b): amended, on 26 September 2002, by [section 5(10)][267] of the Animal Products Amendment Act 2002 (2002 No 29).

##### 38 Nature of regulated control schemes
    
*   (1) The object of a regulated control scheme is to impose risk management measures in circumstances where---
        
    *   (a) it is not feasible or practicable for the relevant risk factors to be managed by individual animal product business operators within individual risk management programmes (whether or not those operators would normally be required to have a risk management programme); or
    
    *   (b) having regard to considerations of economic efficiency, or to legal considerations that may require the exercise of statutory authority for the successful management of risk factors, it is necessary or appropriate that the measures be imposed generally rather than being dealt with by way of individual risk management programmes; or
    
    *   (c) the measures are additional to those normally required to meet New Zealand animal product standards, and are necessary to meet access requirements of overseas markets as notified or made available under [section 60][76].
    
    (2) A regulated control scheme may be imposed---
        
    *   (a) by way of regulations made under [section 166][256] on the recommendation of the Minister, supplemented by specifications and other requirements set by the Director-General under [section 40][51]:
    
    *   (b) in the case of measures required to meet access requirements of overseas markets that have been notified or made available under [section 60][76], by way of specifications and requirements set by the Director-General under [section 40][51].
    
    Section 38(1)(a): amended, on 26 September 2002, by [section 5(10)][267] of the Animal Products Amendment Act 2002 (2002 No 29).

##### 39 Scope of regulated control schemes
    
*   (1) A regulated control scheme must specify its prime purpose, and may---
        
    *   (a) apply to all or any 1 or more classes of animal material or product, person or business, process or operation, premises or place, or area:
    
    *   (b) without limiting the generality of [section 38][49], provide for matters such as surveying, monitoring, data collection, disease surveillance, sampling, testing, and analysis of or in relation to animal material and products and anything in the environment which may affect the suitability for its intended use of animal material or the fitness for intended purpose of animal products:
    
    *   (c) authorise or provide for technical matters and specifications and matters of detail to be specified by the Director-General under [section 40][51].
    
    (2) No regulated control scheme may be held invalid merely because it---
        
    *   (a) confers any discretion on, or allows any matter to be determined or approved by, the Minister, the Director-General, or any animal product officer; or
    
    *   (b) allows the Minister or the Director-General to impose specifications or requirements as to the performance of any activities.
    
    (3) The Minister may not recommend the making of regulations for the purposes of imposing a regulated control scheme unless he or she---
        
    *   (a) is satisfied that any 1 or more of the criteria specified in [section 38(1)][49] apply; and
    
    *   (b) is satisfied that appropriate consultation has been carried out in accordance with [section 163][251].
    
    (4) In determining whether or not to recommend the making of a regulated control scheme, or the content of such a scheme, the Minister is to have regard to---
        
    *   (a) the need to protect the health of consumers and users of animal products:
    
    *   (b) the most effective way of handling the relevant risk factors:
    
    *   (c) the desirability of facilitating market access:
    
    *   (d) the desirability of maintaining consistency between New Zealand animal product standards and any relevant standards, requirements, or recommended practices that apply or are accepted internationally:
    
    *   (e) the relative costs of having the scheme or not having it, who bears the cost, and any positive and negative impacts on consumers and users:
    
    *   (f) whether the scheme option proposed or selected is the most cost effective way of achieving its prime purpose:
    
    *   (g) such other matters as the Minister considers relevant.
    
    Section 39(b): substituted, on 7 July 2010, by [section 7][321] of the Animal Products Amendment Act 2010 (2010 No 47).

##### 40 Director-General may set specifications and other requirements for purposes of regulated control schemes
    
*   (1) The Director-General may from time to time, by notice under [section 167][257], set specifications and other detailed requirements that---
        
    *   (a) are specified or contemplated by or necessary or desirable to give effect to a regulated control scheme; or
    
    *   (b) are necessary or desirable to meet overseas market access requirements that have been notified or made available under [section 60][76]; or
    
    *   (c) are necessary or desirable to amplify the manner in which the requirements of any such scheme or requirements may or are to be met.
    
    (2) The Director-General may set specifications and other requirements under subsection (1)(a) or (c) only after having regard to the matters specified in [section 39(4)][50] and (except where [section 163(5)][251] applies) after appropriate consultation carried out in accordance with section 163\.

##### 41 Emergency control schemes
    
*   (1) The Minister may, by order, institute emergency control schemes if, in the opinion of the Minister,---
        
    *   (a) an emergency or urgent situation has arisen involving risk to---
            
        *   (i) human or animal health; or
        
        *   (ii) the integrity or reputation of New Zealand exports of animal material or products; or
        
        *   (iii) overseas market access for New Zealand exports of animal material or products; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) it is not practicable in the circumstances of the particular case, in time to deal with the situation, to---
            
        *   (i) issue or amend regulations or specifications in accordance with [sections 39][50] and [40][51]; or
        
        *   (ii) otherwise effectively alleviate or minimise the relevant risk.
        
        
    
    (2) Any such order may contain any of the matters specified in [sections 39][50] and [40][51].
    
    (3) Any such order must as soon as practicable be---
        
    *   (a) either published or notified in the _Gazette_; and
    
    *   (b) to the extent practicable, brought to the attention of all persons likely to be affected by it.
    
    (4) If the order is notified only, and not published, in the _Gazette_,---
        
    *   (a) the Director-General must make copies of the order available for inspection free of charge, and for purchase at a reasonable cost, at the head office of the Ministry and at such other places as the Director-General determines as necessary or appropriate; and
    
    *   (b) the _Gazette_ notice must specify where a copy of the order may be inspected or obtained.

*   Standards and specifications set under this Part may apply in respect of any class or description of animal material or product, person or business, process or operation, equipment or other thing, premises or place, or area, and may apply regardless of whether or not a risk management programme is in place or required in respect of the relevant material or product, person or business, process or operation, premises or place, or area.

##### 44 Regulations may prescribe animal product standards
    
*   (1) Regulations may be made under [section 166][256], on the recommendation of the Minister, prescribing standards that specify the criteria that must be met to ensure that animal products produced or processed for reward or trade or for export from New Zealand are fit for intended purpose.

    (6) No prescribed standard may be held invalid merely because it---

    *   (b) allows the Minister, the Director-General, or any other person to impose requirements as to the performance of any activities.

    *   (c) the dual operator butcher must operate under a risk management programme in respect of all regulated animal products within the retail butchery business (and accordingly is deemed to have made an election under [section 32][41]) at the premises or place concerned, and may not operate under the Food Act regime at the premises or place:
    
    *   (d) in addition to any other matters required under [Part 2][15], the risk management programme of the dual operator butcher must identify and specify the following matters:

*   (1) If a homekill or recreational catch service provider at any time processes any animal product sourced from operations subject to a registered risk management programme or a regulated control scheme or the Food Act regime (or from premises licensed under the Meat Act 1981), then, unless subsection (2) applies, that product ceases to be regulated animal product, and cannot be traded.
    
    (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to the processing of animal product by a dual operator butcher at the dual operator butcher's premises or place under the dual operator butcher's registered risk management programme for regulated animal products, and in this case the animal product remains regulated animal product that can be traded.

## Part 9  
Cost recovery

##### 113 Principles of cost recovery
    
*   (1) The Minister and the Director-General are to take all reasonable steps to ensure that so many of the direct and indirect costs of administering this Act as are not provided for by money appropriated by Parliament for the purpose are recovered under this Part, whether by way of fees, levies, or otherwise.
    
    (2) In determining the most appropriate method of cost recovery under [section 114][194], and its level, in any particular case or class of cases of animal material or product, animal product business, person, or other matter, the Minister and Director-General are to have regard, as far as is reasonably practicable, to the following criteria:
        
    *   (a) equity, in that funding for a particular function, power, or service, or a particular class of functions, powers, or services, should generally, and to the extent practicable, be sourced from the users or beneficiaries of the relevant function, power, or service at a level commensurate with their use or benefit from the function, power, or service:
    
    *   (b) efficiency, in that costs should generally be allocated and recovered in order to ensure that maximum benefits are delivered at minimum cost:
    
    *   (c) justifiability, in that costs should be collected only to meet the reasonable costs (including indirect costs) for the provision or exercise of the relevant function, power, or service:
    
    *   (d) transparency, in that costs should be identified and allocated as closely as practicable in relation to tangible service provision for the recovery period in which the service is provided.
    
    (3) Costs should not be recovered under this Part unless there has been appropriate consultation with affected parties in accordance with [section 163][251], and the parties involved have been given sufficient time and information to make an informed contribution.
    
    (4) Nothing in subsection (3) or [section 163][251] requires consultation in relation to specific fees or charges, or the specific levels of fees or charges, so long as the fees or charges set are reasonably within the purview of any general consultation or any consultation carried out for the purposes of [section 116][197], and a failure to comply with subsection (3) does not affect the validity of any regulations made for the purposes of this Part.
    
    (5) Nothing in this section requires a strict apportionment of the costs to be recovered for a particular function or service based on usage, and, without limiting the way in which fees or charges may be set, a fee or charge may be set at a level or in a way that---
        
    *   (a) is determined by calculations that involve an averaging of costs or potential costs:
    
    *   (b) takes into account costs or potential costs of services that are not directly to be provided to the person who pays the fee or charge but which are an indirect or potential cost arising from the delivery of the service in question to a class of persons or all persons who use the service.
    
    

##### 114 Methods of cost recovery
    
*   The methods by which costs may be recovered under this Part are as follows:
        
    *   (a) fixed fees or charges:
    
    *   (b) fees or charges based on a scale or formula or at a rate determined on an hourly or other unit basis:
    
    *   (c) the recovery by way of fee or charge of actual and reasonable costs expended in or associated with the performance of a service or function:
    
    *   (d) estimated fees or charges, or fees or charges based on estimated costs, paid before the provision of the service or function, followed by reconciliation and an appropriate further payment or refund after provision of the service or function:
    
    *   (e) refundable or non-refundable deposits paid before provision of the service or performance of the function:
    
    *   (f) fees or charges imposed on users of services or third parties:
    
    *   (g) levies:
    
    *   (h) any combination of the above.
    
    Section 114(b): amended, on 26 September 2002, by [section 39][374] of the Animal Products Amendment Act 2002 (2002 No 29).

##### 115 Cost recovery to relate generally to a financial year
    
*   (1) Except as provided in subsection (2), any regulations under this Part that set a fee, charge, or levy that applies in any financial year---
        
    *   (a) must have been made before the start of that financial year; but
    
    *   (b) except as the regulations may otherwise provide, apply in that year and all subsequent years until revoked or replaced.
    
    (2) Subsection (1) does not prevent the alteration or setting during any financial year of a fee, charge, or levy payable in that year if either the fee, charge, or levy is reduced or removed (or restated without substantive alteration) or, in the case of an increase or a new fee, charge, or levy,---
        
    *   (a) appropriate consultation has been carried out with persons or representatives of persons substantially affected by the alteration or setting; and
    
    *   (b) the Minister is satisfied that those persons, or their representatives, agree or substantially agree with the alteration or setting.
    
    (3) Subsection (1) does not prevent the amendment of any regulation setting a fee, charge, or levy if any substantive alteration effected by the amendment is for the purpose of correcting an error.
    
    (4) Recovery may be made in any financial year of any shortfall in cost recovery for any of the preceding 4 financial years and allowance may be made for any over-recovery of costs in those years (including any estimated shortfall or over-recovery for the immediately preceding financial year).
    
    Section 115(2): amended, on 26 September 2002, by [section 40][375] of the Animal Products Amendment Act 2002 (2002 No 29).

    Section 115A: inserted, on 15 December 2007, by [section 22][377] of the Dairy Industry Restructuring Amendment Act 2007 (2007 No 107).

##### 116 Three-yearly review of cost recovery
    
*   (1) The Minister must cause to be reviewed, at least once in every 3-year period occurring since the original setting of, or latest change to, the levels and methods of cost recovery in relation to any class of animal material or product, animal product business, person, or other matter, the levels and methods of cost recovery in the relevant area that are likely to be appropriate for the following financial year or years.
    
    (2) The Minister must ensure that appropriate consultation takes place in relation to any such review.
    
    (3) A review may make provision for recovery in any relevant financial year of any shortfall in cost recovery for any of the preceding 4 financial years, or make allowance for any over-recovery of costs in those years (including any estimated shortfall or over-recovery for the immediately preceding financial year).
    
    (4) Subsection (1) does not require all areas of cost recovery to be reviewed at the same time, and nor does it impose any time limit on the making of regulations to implement the results of a review.

##### 117 Fees and charges to be prescribed by regulations
    
*   (1) Regulations may be made under this Act, on the recommendation of the Minister, prescribing fees and charges for the purposes of this Act.

    (3) Different fees and charges, or different rates or types of fee or charge, may be prescribed in respect of different classes or descriptions of animal material, animal products, persons or businesses, operations, or other matters, or any combination of them.
    
    (4) Without limiting subsection (3), the fees and charges prescribed may---
        
    *   (a) differ depending on whether or not a special or urgent service is provided:

    (5) The Minister may not recommend the making of regulations under this section unless satisfied that, to the extent appropriate in the circumstances, the requirements of [sections 113][193] and [115][195] have been met.
    
    Section 117(4A): inserted, on 26 September 2002, by [section 41][378] of the Animal Products Amendment Act 2002 (2002 No 29).

##### 118 Regulations may impose levies
    
*   (1) Regulations may be made under this Act, on the recommendation of the Minister, prescribing levies for the purposes of this Act.
    
    (2) Different levies or rates of levy or bases on which an amount of levy is to be calculated or ascertained may be prescribed for different purposes, and different levies or rates of levy or bases for calculation may be set for different classes or descriptions of animal material, animal products, persons or businesses, operations, or other matters, or any combination of them.

        *   (ii) the amount of levy any person is required to pay or collect;---
        
        and provide for related matters, including procedures and remuneration for arbitrators or mediators.
    
    (4) The Minister may not recommend the making of regulations under this section unless satisfied that, to the extent appropriate in the circumstances, the requirements of [sections 113][193] and [115][195] have been met.

##### 119 Trust accounts required to be kept by persons collecting levies
    
*   (1) Where regulations made under [section 118][199] require the operation of a trust account for any levy money by the person responsible for collecting the levy,---
        
    *   (a) any amount held in such an account that is due to be paid to the Director-General by the levy collector is to be treated as levy money held on trust for the Director-General; and
    
    *   (b) any amount so held on trust is not available for the payment of any creditor (other than the Director-General) of the levy collector, and is not liable to be attached or taken in execution at the instance of any such creditor; and
    
    *   (c) a person who ceases to be a person responsible for collecting a levy must continue to maintain the trust account until all the levy money payable to the Director-General in respect of the period during which the person was responsible for collecting the levy has been paid.

##### 120 Other charges not requiring to be prescribed
    
*   (1) Nothing in this Part or any other provision of this Act prevents the Director-General from requiring a reasonable charge to be paid for any of the services the Ministry provides in relation to the administration of this Act, or any actual and reasonable expenses incurred in providing the services, other than services in respect of which a fee or charge or levy is prescribed under this Part.
    
    (2) Without limiting subsection (1), and for the avoidance of doubt, the Director-General may---

##### 123 Penalties for failure to pay fee, levy, or charge

    *   (b) [section 15][380] of that Act applies to allow the Director-General, in appropriate cases, to waive the payment of all or any of the amount of any such increase; and

    (2) For the purposes of subsection (1)(c) of this section and [section 16][381] of the Ministries of Agriculture and Forestry (Restructuring) Act 1997, and without limiting the generality of that section 16, the references in those provisions to the withdrawal or refusal to provide any service are to be treated as also authorising the Director-General, in an appropriate case, to---
        
    *   (a) withhold or suspend any approval under this Act, or refuse to perform any function under this Act in relation to the person in default:
    
    *   (b) withhold the registration of any exporter or risk management programme, or the listing of any homekill or recreational catch service provider, under this Act, or require the suspension of any relevant operations of the exporter or operator of the risk management programme:
    
    *   (c) withhold any official assurance.
    
    (3) Where the withdrawal of any approval or registration under this section, or any suspension of operations, requires the Director-General to provide any further service, perform any further function, or incur any further costs in the interests of ensuring the fitness for intended purpose of the animal product involved in the withdrawal or suspension, the Director-General may recover any reasonable amount for the additional service, function, or costs as a debt due from the person who owns or is responsible for the operation concerned.

##### 124 Obligation to pay fee, levy, or charge not suspended by dispute
    
*   The obligation of a person to pay any fee, levy, or charge under this Act (including any penalty referred to in [section 123][204]), and the right of the Director-General to receive and recover the fee, levy, charge, or penalty, are not suspended by any dispute between the person and the Director-General regarding the person's liability to pay the fee, levy, or charge, or the amount of the fee, levy, or charge.

    (3) No certificate of an analyst, a recognised agency, or a recognised person, and no other evidence of an analysis, test, or examination under this Act, is to be ruled inadmissible or disregarded by reason only of the fact that any of the provisions of this Act or of any regulations or specifications made under this Act relating to the taking, analysing, testing, or examining of samples have not been strictly complied with, if there has been reasonable compliance with those provisions.

##### 141 Presumption as to authority
    
*   (1) A return, record, transaction, form, application, or other information purporting to be completed, kept, or provided by or on behalf of a person is for the purposes of this Act to be presumed to have been completed, kept, or provided by that person unless the contrary is proved.
    
    (2) The production of---
        
    *   (a) any document presented by an animal product officer purporting to be a notice or an extract from a notice issued by the Director-General in accordance with [section 164][252] or [section 167][257], or a copy of any such notice or extract; and
    
    *   (b) a copy of the _Gazette_ in which the notice was notified---
    
    is in all courts and in all proceedings sufficient evidence, until the contrary is proved, of the existence, notification, and contents of the notice.

##### 142 Liability of body corporate
    
*   If, in the course of proceedings against a body corporate for an offence against this Act, it is necessary to establish the state of mind of the body corporate, it is sufficient to show that a director, employee, or agent of the body corporate, acting within the scope of that person's actual or apparent authority, had that state of mind.

##### 143 Liability of directors and managers of companies
    
*   Where a body corporate is convicted of an offence against this Act, every director and every person concerned in the management of the body corporate is also guilty of a like offence if it is proved that---
        
    *   (a) the act or omission that constituted the offence took place with the authority, permission, or consent of the director or person; or
    
    *   (b) the director or person knew that the offence was to be or was being committed, and failed to take all reasonable steps to prevent or stop it.
    
    

##### 144 Liability of companies and persons for actions of agent or employee
    
*   (1) Any act or omission on behalf of a body corporate or other person (both called _the principal_) by a director, agent, or employee (each called _the agent_) of the principal is to be treated for the purposes of this Act as being also the act or omission of the principal.
    
    (2) Despite subsection (1), where a principal is charged under this Act in relation to the act or omission of an agent for an offence against any of [sections 126][208], [127][209], [128][210], [131(1)(b)][213], 131(1)(c), and 131(2)(b), it is a good defence to the charge if the principal proves that the principal took all reasonable steps to prevent the commission of the offence or the commission of offences of that kind.

##### 145 Time limit for filing charging document for offence against section 129 or 135
    
*   (1) Despite anything to the contrary in [section 25][390] of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011, the limitation period in respect of an offence against [section 129][211] or [135][217] of this Act ends on the date that is 2 years after the date on which the offence was committed.
    
    (2) Nothing in subsection (1) affects the application of [section 25][390] of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011 in relation to any offence not mentioned in that subsection.
    
    Section 145: replaced, on 1 July 2013, by [section 413][383] of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011 (2011 No 81).
