An Act to incorporate The Baptist Union of New Zealand, and to vest certain Real and Personal Property in the Union, and to provide for the Transfer of Real Property to the Union to be held in Trust for Individual Churches of the Union.
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    WHEREAS certain persons, being members of the religious denomination called Baptists, in the Dominion of New Zealand, and holding as their general tenets the articles of faith set forth in Schedule [1][19] hereto, did in or about the year eighteen hundred and eighty-two form an association called ""The Baptist Union of New Zealand"": And whereas the members of the said association have met in conference annually since the date of its formation: And whereas the existing constitution and rules of the said association are set forth in Schedule [2][20] hereto: And whereas the said association has from time to time raised sums of money and created special funds---(a) to augment the salaries of the ministers and home and foreign missionaries within the said association; and (b) to provide annuities for ministers and home and foreign missionaries of the said association, and the wives and children of such ministers and missionaries: And whereas the said trust funds of the said association and the securities therefor and the names of the trustees holding the same are severally set forth and described in Schedules [3][21] and [4][22] hereto: And whereas certain lands and buildings within the Dominion of New Zealand are vested in trustees for the said association: And whereas certain other lands in connection with the various Churches of the said denomination are vested in trustees elected by the said Churches individually and in trust Boards incorporated under the [Charitable Trusts Act 1957][25], upon the trusts declared in the several declarations of trust affecting the same respectively: And whereas the sole right of appointment of trustees to hold the real and personal property of a certain institution near the City of Auckland, called the Manurewa Children's Home, and formerly known as the Remuera Children's Home, is vested in and exercised by the said association: And whereas the real property of the said Manurewa Children's Home and the mortgages held as security for certain trust funds thereof and the names of the existing trustees are described and set forth in Schedule [5][23] hereto: And whereas from time to time inconvenience is occasioned by the vesting of the property of each Church and of the Manurewa Children's Home and of the said association in separate sets of trustees, and difficulties arise through the death, incapacity, resignation, or absence from New Zealand of trustees: And whereas it is expedient that the said association should be incorporated with the powers hereinafter conferred:
    
    The reference to the Charitable Trusts Act 1957 was substituted, as from 1 January 1958, for a reference to the ""Religious, Charitable, and Educational Trusts Act 1908"" pursuant to section [63(1)][26] Charitable Trusts Act 1957 (1957 No 18).
