But no money shall be borrowed under the authority of this Act which shall produce to the lender a higher rate of interest than five dollars per centum per annum.
    
    (2.) For the purpose of securing the payment of any moneys borrowed as aforesaid and the interest thereon the Council may appropriate and pledge as such security any one or more of the following:---

    *   (c.) The general revenues of the borough, but not including moneys received or receivable by way of grant from the Government, and as to such general revenues subject to all existing pledges thereof.
    
    (3.) The pledge of the surplus land as aforesaid shall not prevent the exercise of the powers hereinbefore conferred upon the Council until the appointment of a receiver, and shall be subject to the exercise of such powers.
    
    (4.) The debentures and coupons issued under the provisions of this Act shall be in such form as the Council may determine, and may be in or to the effect of the form of debenture and coupon prescribed by the Loans Act, except that this Act shall be referred to therein instead of the Loans Act.
    
    (5.) The debentures representing the loan or loans hereby authorised, whether created at one time or as successive issues, shall rank _pari passu_, and have no preference or priority the one over the other by reason of date of issue or otherwise.

Upon the appointment of a receiver by virtue of the provisions contained or incorporated in this Act the Judge making the appointment may vest in such receiver such powers of management and leasing of and over the surplus land as he shall think fit, including any of the powers hereby conferred on the Council, and may direct in what manner the revenues therefrom shall be applied.
    
    (9.) Every loan raised by virtue of this Act shall, subject and without prejudice to the provisions hereof, be deemed to be a special loan within the meaning of the Loans Act.

##### 17 Copy of special order to be proof of performance of conditions precedent
    
*   A copy of any special order passed pursuant to the preceding provisions, purporting to be under the common seal of the Corporation, and signed by the Mayor and any two Councillors of the borough, shall without further authentication be sufficient proof to any person lending any money to the Council or the Corporation that the loan referred to therein is duly authorised, and shall bind the Corporation and the Council accordingly, and no lender of any money borrowed under the provisions of this Act, whether by the issue of debentures or otherwise, shall be concerned to inquire as to the purpose for which the same is raised nor as to the proposed expenditure thereof, and the issue of a debenture or of the receipt of the Council or any of its officers therefor shall effectually discharge the lender from being concerned to see to the application thereof.

    The words ""five cents in the dollar"" and ""three-tenths of a cent in the dollar"", in subsection (1), were substituted, as from 10 July 1967, for the words ""sixpence in the pound"" and ""three-eighths of a penny in the pound"" pursuant to section [7(1)][26] Decimal Currency Act 1964 (1964 No 27).

##### 20 Special rate not to be quashed
    
*   No special rate shall be quashed by any proceedings in Court or otherwise, and the production of a copy of the _Gazette_ containing the special order making the same shall be conclusive proof of the validity thereof.

*   In the event of the borough being united with any other borough or boroughs, all the powers hereby conferred on the Council and the Corporation respectively shall become vested in the Council and Corporation of such united borough.

##### 22 Exercise of prior statutory powers
