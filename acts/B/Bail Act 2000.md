*   This Act binds the Crown.

##### 5 Purpose
    
*   The purpose of this Act is to reform and restate the law relating to bail.

## Part 1  
General provisions regarding bail

##### 6 Application of this Part
    
*   Unless expressly stated otherwise in this or in any other enactment, any decision regarding the granting of bail under this Act is subject to the provisions of this Part.

##### 7 Rules as to granting bail
    
*   (1) A defendant is bailable as of right who is charged with an offence that is not punishable by imprisonment.
    
    (2) A defendant is bailable as of right who is charged with an offence for which the maximum punishment is less than 3 years' imprisonment, unless the offence is one against [section 194][120] of the Crimes Act 1961 (which relates to assault on a child, or by a male on a female) or against [section 49][121] of the Domestic Violence Act 1995 (which relate to contravention of a protection order).
    
    (3) \[Repealed\]
    
    (4) Despite anything in this section, a defendant who is charged with an offence punishable by imprisonment is not bailable as of right if the defendant has been previously convicted of an offence punishable by death or imprisonment.
    
    (5) Subject to [sections 9 to 17][10], a defendant who is charged with an offence and is not bailable as of right must be released by a court on reasonable terms and conditions unless the court is satisfied that there is just cause for continued detention.
    
    Compare: 1961 No 43 [s 319][122]
    
    Section 7(2): amended, on 28 October 2009, by [section 4][123] of the Bail Amendment Act 2009 (2009 No 45).
    
    Section 7(3): repealed, on 4 September 2013, by [section 5][124] of the Bail Amendment Act 2013 (2013 No 66).

##### 8 Consideration of just cause for continued detention
    
*   (1) In considering whether there is just cause for continued detention, the court must take into account---
        
    *   (a) whether there is a risk that---
            
        *   (i) the defendant may fail to appear in court on the date to which the defendant has been remanded; or
        
        *   (ii) the defendant may interfere with witnesses or evidence; or
        
        *   (iii) the defendant may offend while on bail; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) any matter that would make it unjust to detain the defendant.
    
    (2) In considering whether there is just cause for continued detention under subsection (1), the court may take into account the following:
        
    *   (a) the nature of the offence with which the defendant is charged, and whether it is a grave or less serious one of its kind:
    
    *   (b) the strength of the evidence and the probability of conviction or otherwise:
    
    *   (c) the seriousness of the punishment to which the defendant is liable, and the severity of the punishment that is likely to be imposed:
    
    *   (d) the character and past conduct or behaviour, in particular proven criminal behaviour, of the defendant:
    
    *   (e) whether the defendant has a history of offending while on bail, or breaching court orders, including orders imposing bail conditions:
    
    *   (f) the likely length of time before the matter comes to hearing or trial:
    
    *   (g) the possibility of prejudice to the defence in the preparation of the defence if the defendant is remanded in custody:
    
    *   (h) any other special matter that is relevant in the particular circumstances.
    
    (3) \[Repealed\]
    
    (4) When considering an application for bail, the court must take into account any views of a victim of an offence of a kind referred to in [section 29][125] of the Victims' Rights Act 2002, or of a parent or legal guardian of a victim of that kind, conveyed in accordance with [section 30][126] of that Act.
    
    (4A) When considering an application for bail, the court must not take into account the fact that the defendant has provided, or may provide, information relating to the investigation or prosecution of any offence, including any offence committed or alleged to have been committed by the defendant.
    
    (4B) However, despite subsection (4A), the court may take into account the cooperation by the defendant with authorities in the investigation or prosecution of any offence if that cooperation is relevant to the court's assessment of the risk that the defendant will fail to appear in court, interfere with witnesses or evidence, or offend while on bail.
    
    (5) In deciding, in relation to a defendant charged with an offence against [section 49][121] of the Domestic Violence Act 1995, whether or not to grant bail to the defendant or allow the defendant to go at large, the court's paramount consideration is the need to protect the victim of the alleged offence.
    
    Section 8: substituted, on 1 October 2007, by [section 4][127] of the Bail Amendment Act 2007 (2007 No 26).
    
    Section 8(1)(a): amended, on 17 December 2008, by [section 4(1)][128] of the Bail Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No 107).
    
    Section 8(3): repealed, on 17 December 2008, by [section 4(2)][128] of the Bail Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No 107).
    
    Section 8(4A): inserted, on 4 September 2013, by [section 6][129] of the Bail Amendment Act 2013 (2013 No 66).
    
    Section 8(4B): inserted, on 4 September 2013, by [section 6][129] of the Bail Amendment Act 2013 (2013 No 66).
    
    Section 8(5): amended, on 28 October 2009, by [section 5][130] of the Bail Amendment Act 2009 (2009 No 45).

##### 9 Restriction on bail if defendant charged with treason or espionage
    
*   No defendant who is charged with a crime against [section 73][131] or [section 76][132] of the Crimes Act 1961 (which relate to treason) or against [section 78][133] of the Crimes Act 1961 (which relates to espionage) may be granted bail except by order of the Governor-General or a High Court Judge.
    
    Compare: 1961 No 43 [s 318(1)][134]

##### 9A Restriction on bail if defendant charged with murder
    
*   (1) This section applies to a defendant of or over the age of 17 years who is charged with murder under [section 167][135] or [168][136] of the Crimes Act 1961\.

    (3) No defendant to whom this section applies may be granted bail or allowed to go at large unless the defendant satisfies the Judge that bail or remand at large should be granted.
    
    (4) In particular (but without limiting any other matters in respect of which the defendant must satisfy the Judge under subsection (3)), the defendant must satisfy the Judge on the balance of probabilities that the defendant will not, while on bail or at large, commit any offence involving violence against, or danger to the safety of, any other person.
    
    (5) In deciding whether or not to grant bail to a defendant to whom this section applies or to allow the defendant to go at large, the need to protect the safety of the public and, where appropriate, the need to protect the safety of any particular person or persons are the primary considerations.
    
    Section 9A: inserted, on 4 September 2013, by [section 7][137] of the Bail Amendment Act 2013 (2013 No 66).

##### 10 Restriction on bail if defendant with previous conviction for specified offence charged with further specified offence

    (4) No defendant to whom this section applies may be granted bail or allowed to go at large unless the defendant satisfies the Judge that bail or remand at large should be granted.
    
    (5) In particular (but without limiting any other matters in respect of which the defendant must satisfy the Judge under subsection (4)), the defendant must satisfy the Judge on the balance of probabilities that the defendant will not, while on bail or at large, commit any offence involving violence against, or danger to the safety of, any other person.
    
    (6) In deciding whether or not to grant bail to a defendant to whom this section applies or allow the defendant to go at large, the need to protect the safety of the public and, where appropriate, the need to protect the safety of the victim or victims of the alleged offending, are primary considerations.
