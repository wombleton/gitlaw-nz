    *   (a) [section 111][114] (false statements or declarations):
    
    *   (b) [section 151][115] (duty to provide necessaries and protect from injury):

    (4) Despite anything in this section, a defendant who is charged with an offence punishable by imprisonment is not bailable as of right if the defendant has been previously convicted of an offence punishable by death or imprisonment.
    
    (5) Subject to [sections 9 to 17][10], a defendant who is charged with an offence and is not bailable as of right must be released by a court on reasonable terms and conditions unless the court is satisfied that there is just cause for continued detention.
    
    Compare: 1961 No 43 [s 319][125]
    
    Section 7(2): amended, on 28 October 2009, by [section 4][126] of the Bail Amendment Act 2009 (2009 No 45).

##### 8 Consideration of just cause for continued detention
    
*   (1) In considering whether there is just cause for continued detention, the court must take into account---
        
    *   (a) whether there is a risk that---
            
        *   (i) the defendant may fail to appear in court on the date to which the defendant has been remanded; or
        
        *   (ii) the defendant may interfere with witnesses or evidence; or
        
        *   (iii) the defendant may offend while on bail; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) any matter that would make it unjust to detain the defendant.
    
    (2) In considering whether there is just cause for continued detention under subsection (1), the court may take into account the following:
        
    *   (a) the nature of the offence with which the defendant is charged, and whether it is a grave or less serious one of its kind:
    
    *   (b) the strength of the evidence and the probability of conviction or otherwise:
    
    *   (c) the seriousness of the punishment to which the defendant is liable, and the severity of the punishment that is likely to be imposed:
    
    *   (d) the character and past conduct or behaviour, in particular proven criminal behaviour, of the defendant:
    
    *   (e) whether the defendant has a history of offending while on bail, or breaching court orders, including orders imposing bail conditions:

    *   (g) the possibility of prejudice to the defence in the preparation of the defence if the defendant is remanded in custody:
    
    *   (h) any other special matter that is relevant in the particular circumstances.
    
    (3) \[Repealed\]
    
    (4) When considering an application for bail, the court must take into account any views of a victim of an offence of a kind referred to in [section 29][128] of the Victims' Rights Act 2002, or of a parent or legal guardian of a victim of that kind, conveyed in accordance with [section 30][129] of that Act.
    
    (5) In deciding, in relation to a defendant charged with an offence against [section 49][113] of the Domestic Violence Act 1995, whether or not to grant bail to the defendant or allow the defendant to go at large, the court's paramount consideration is the need to protect the victim of the alleged offence.

##### 10 Restriction on bail if defendant with previous conviction for specified offence charged with further specified offence
    
*   (1) This section applies to a defendant of or over the age of 17 years who is charged with a specified offence (as defined in subsection (2)), and who has 1 or more previous convictions for a specified offence (whether those convictions were for the same specified offence or for different specified offences).
    
    (2) In this section, _specified offence_ means any offence against any of the following provisions of the [Crimes Act 1961][110]:

    (3) No defendant to whom this section applies may be granted bail or allowed to go at large except by order of a High Court Judge or a District Court Judge.
    
    (4) No defendant to whom this section applies may be granted bail or allowed to go at large unless the defendant satisfies the Judge that bail or remand at large should be granted.
    
    (5) In particular (but without limiting any other matters in respect of which the defendant must satisfy the Judge under subsection (4)), the defendant must satisfy the Judge on the balance of probabilities that the defendant will not, while on bail or at large, commit any offence involving violence against, or danger to the safety of, any other person.
    
    (6) In deciding whether or not to grant bail to a defendant to whom this section applies or allow the defendant to go at large, the need to protect the safety of the public and, where appropriate, the need to protect the safety of the victim or victims of the alleged offending, are primary considerations.
    
    Compare: 1961 No 43 [s 318(2)--(5), (7)][136]
    
    Section 10(2)(a): substituted, on 20 May 2005, by [section 10][149] of the Crimes Amendment Act 2005 (2005 No 41).

    Compare: 1961 No 43 [s 318(6)][136]

##### 12 Further restriction on bail in certain cases
    
*   (1) This section applies to a defendant if---
        
    *   (a) the defendant is of or over the age of 17 years and---
            
        *   (i) is charged with an offence under the [Crimes Act 1961][110] that carries a maximum sentence of 3 or more years' imprisonment; and
        
        *   (ii) at the time of the alleged commission of the offence was remanded at large or on bail awaiting trial for another offence under the [Crimes Act 1961][110] that carries a maximum sentence of 3 or more years' imprisonment; and
        
        *   (iii) has at any time previously received a sentence of imprisonment (within the meaning of that term in [section 4(1)][150] of the Sentencing Act 2002); or
        
        
    
    *   (b) the defendant is of or over the age of 17 years and---
            
        *   (i) is charged with an offence that carries a maximum sentence of 3 or more years' imprisonment; and
        
        *   (ii) has previously received 14 or more sentences of imprisonment (within the meaning of that term in [section 4(1)][150] of the Sentencing Act 2002); and
        
        *   (iii) has previously been convicted of an offence that was committed while the defendant was remanded at large or on bail and that carries a maximum sentence of 3 or more years' imprisonment (whether or not the conviction resulted in any of the sentences of imprisonment referred to in subparagraph (ii)).
        
        
    
    (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), a sentence of imprisonment is counted whether or not it was served concurrently with any other 1 or more sentences.
    
    (3) No defendant to whom this section applies may be granted bail or allowed to go at large except by order of a High Court Judge or a District Court Judge.
    
    (4) No defendant to whom this section applies may be granted bail or allowed to go at large unless the defendant satisfies the Judge that bail or remand at large should be granted.
    
    (5) In particular (but without limiting any other matters in respect of which the defendant must satisfy the Judge under subsection (4)), the defendant must satisfy the Judge on the balance of probabilities that the defendant will not, while on bail or at large, commit---
        
    *   (a) any offence involving violence against, or danger to the safety of, any other person; or
    
    *   (b) burglary or any other serious property offence.
    
    (6) For the purposes of subsection (5), _serious property offence_ means an offence against [Part 10][151] of the Crimes Act 1961 punishable by imprisonment for a term of more than 7 years.
    
    (7) In deciding whether or not to grant bail to a defendant to whom this section applies or allow the defendant to go at large, the need to protect the safety of the public and, where appropriate, the need to protect the safety of the victim or victims of the alleged offending, are primary considerations.
    
    (8) For the purposes of this section, a reference in this section to a _sentence of imprisonment_ includes a sentence of corrective training imposed under the [Criminal Justice Act 1985][152] or any former Act.
    
    Section 12(1)(a)(iii): amended, on 30 June 2002, by [section 186][153] of the Sentencing Act 2002 (2002 No 9).

##### 13 Exercise of discretion when considering bail pending sentencing
    
*   (1) If a defendant is found guilty or if a defendant pleads guilty, the court must not grant bail unless it is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that it would be in the interests of justice in the particular case to do so.
    
    (2) The onus is on the defendant to show cause why bail should be granted.
    
    (3) When considering the interests of justice under subsection (1), the court may, instead of the considerations in [section 8][9], take into account the following considerations:
        
    *   (a) whether the defendant is likely to receive a sentence of imprisonment:
    
    *   (b) the likely length of time that will pass before the defendant is sentenced:
    
    *   (c) the personal circumstances of the defendant and the defendant's immediate family:
    
    *   (d) any other consideration that the court considers relevant.
    
    (4) If the defendant is unlikely to receive a sentence of imprisonment, this must count against the defendant being remanded in custody.
    
    (4A) Despite being satisfied that it would otherwise be in the interests of justice to grant bail, the court may remand the defendant in custody for the purpose described in subsection (4B) if it is satisfied that---
        
    *   (a) the defendant has breached a condition of bail imposed under [section 31(2A)][39]; and
    
    *   (b) there is no other reasonable means to achieve the purpose described in subsection (4B).
    
    (4B) The purpose referred to in subsection (4A) is to ensure that the defendant takes the steps necessary for the proceedings to be progressed within a reasonable time frame.
    
    (5) This section is subject to [section 11][12].
    
    Section 13(4A): inserted, on 5 March 2012, by [section 4][154] of the Bail Amendment Act 2011 (2011 No 82).
    
    Section 13(4B): inserted, on 5 March 2012, by [section 4][154] of the Bail Amendment Act 2011 (2011 No 82).

##### 14 Exercise of discretion when considering bail pending appeal

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Bail Act 2000\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 19 March 2012, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][268] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][269] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][270] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][271] and [17E][272] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
