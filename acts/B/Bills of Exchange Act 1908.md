## Part 1  
Bills of exchange

#### Forms and interpretation

##### 3 _Bill of exchange_ defined
    
*   (1) A bill of exchange is an unconditional order in writing, addressed by one person to another, signed by the person giving it, requiring the person to whom it is addressed to pay on demand, or at a fixed or determinable future time, a sum certain in money to or to the order of a specified person, or to bearer.
    
    (2) An instrument that does not comply with these conditions, or that orders any act to be done in addition to the payment of money, is not a bill of exchange.
    
    (3) An order to pay out of a particular fund is not unconditional within the meaning of this section; but an unqualified order to pay, coupled with (a) an indication of a particular fund out of which the drawee is to reimburse himself or a particular account to be debited with the amount, or (b) a statement of the transaction giving rise to the bill, is unconditional.
    
    (4) A bill is not invalid by reason that---
        
    *   (a) It is not dated:
    
    *   (b) It does not specify the value given, or that any value has been given, therefor:
    
    *   (c) It does not specify the place where it is drawn or the place where it is payable.
    
    Compare: 1883 No 8 s 3

##### 4 Inland and foreign bills
    
*   (1) An _inland bill_ is a bill that is, or on the face of it purports to be,---
        
    *   (a) both drawn and payable in New Zealand; or
    
    *   (b) drawn in New Zealand on a person who resides or has a place of business in New Zealand.
    
    (1A) Any other bill is a _foreign bill_.
    
    (2) Unless the contrary appears on the face of the bill the holder may treat it as an inland bill.
    
    Compare: 1883 No 8 s 4; 1884 No 28 s 2
    
    Subsection (1) was substituted, as from 19 December 2002, by section [3][118] Bills of Exchange Amendment Act 2002 (2002 No 58).
    
    Subsection (1A) was inserted, as from 19 December 2002, by section [3][118] Bills of Exchange Amendment Act 2002 (2002 No 58).

##### 5 How bills may be drawn
    
*   (1) A bill may be drawn payable to or to the order of the drawer; or it may be drawn payable to or to the order of the drawee.
    
    (2) Where in a bill drawer and drawee are the same person, or where the drawee is a fictitious person or a person not having capacity to contract, the holder may treat the instrument, at his option, either as a bill of exchange or as a promissory note.
    
    Compare: 1883 No 8 s 5

##### 6 Address to drawee
    
*   (1) The drawee must be named or otherwise indicated in a bill with reasonable certainty.
    
    (2) A bill may be addressed to 2 or more drawees, whether they are partners or not; but an order addressed to 2 drawees in the alternative, or to 2 or more drawees in succession, is not a bill of exchange.
    
    Compare: 1883 No 8 s 6

##### 7 Certainty required as to payee
    
*   (1) Where a bill is not payable to bearer, the payee must be named or otherwise indicated therein with reasonable certainty.
    
    (2) A bill may be made payable---
        
    *   (a) To 2 or more payees jointly; or
    
    *   (b) In the alternative to 1 of 2, or 1 or some of several payees; or
    
    *   (c) To the holder of an office for the time being.
    
    (3) Where the payee is a fictitious or non-existing person the bill may be treated as payable to bearer.
    
    Compare: 1883 No 8 s 7

##### 8 What bills are negotiable
    
*   (1) Where a bill contains words prohibiting transfer, or indicating an intention that it is not transferable, it is valid as between the parties thereto, but is not negotiable.
    
    (2) A negotiable bill may be payable either to order or to bearer.
    
    (3) A bill is payable to bearer if it is expressed to be so payable, or if the only or the last indorsement thereon is an indorsement in blank.
    
    (4) A bill is payable to order if it is expressed to be so payable, or if it is expressed to be payable to a particular person, and does not contain words prohibiting transfer or indicating an intention that it is not transferable.
    
    (5) Where a bill, either originally or by indorsement, is expressed to be payable to the order of a specified person, and not to him or his order, it is nevertheless payable to him or his order at his option.
    
    Compare: 1883 No 8 s 8

##### 9 Sum payable
    
*   (1) The sum payable by a bill is a sum certain within the meaning of this Act, although it is required to be paid---
        
    *   (a) With interest:
    
    *   (b) By stated instalments:
    
    *   (c) By stated instalments, with a provision that upon default in payment of any instalment the whole shall become due:
    
    *   (d) According to an indicated rate of exchange, or according to a rate of exchange to be ascertained as directed by the bill.
    
    (2) Where the sum payable is expressed in words and also in figures, and there is a discrepancy between the 2, the sum denoted by the words is the amount payable.
    
    (3) Where a bill is expressed to be payable with interest, unless the instrument provides otherwise, interest runs from the date of the bill, and, if the bill is undated, from the issue thereof.
    
    Compare: 1883 No 8 s 9

##### 10 Bill payable on demand
    
*   (1) A bill is payable on demand---
        
    *   (a) If it is expressed to be payable on demand, or at sight, or on presentation; or
    
    *   (b) If no time for payment is expressed therein.
    
    (2) Where a bill is accepted or indorsed when it is overdue, it shall, as regards the acceptor who so accepts, or any indorser who so indorses it, be deemed a bill payable on demand.
    
    Compare: 1883 No 8 s 10

##### 11 Bill payable at a future time
    
*   (1) A bill is payable at a determinable future time within the meaning of this Act if it is expressed to be payable---
        
    *   (a) At a fixed period after date or sight:
    
    *   (b) On or at a fixed period after the occurrence of a specified event that is certain to happen, though the time of happening may be uncertain.
    
    (2) An instrument expressed to be payable on a contingency is not a bill, and the happening of the event does not cure the defect.
    
    Compare: 1883 No 8 s 11

##### 12 Omission of date in bill payable after date
    
*   Where a bill expressed to be payable at a fixed period after date is issued undated, or where the acceptance of a bill payable at a fixed period after sight is undated, any holder may insert therein the true date of issue or acceptance, and the bill shall be payable accordingly:
    
    Provided that (a) where the holder in good faith and by mistake inserts a wrong date, and (b) in every case where a wrong date is inserted, if the bill subsequently comes into the hands of a holder in due course, it shall not be avoided by the insertion of a wrong date, but shall operate and be payable as if the date so inserted had been the true date.
    
    Compare: 1883 No 8 s 12

##### 13 Antedating and postdating
    
*   (1) Where a bill or an acceptance or any indorsement on a bill is dated, the date shall, unless the contrary is proved, be deemed to be the true date of the drawing, acceptance, or indorsement, as the case may be.
    
    (2) A bill is not invalid by reason only that it is antedated or postdated, or that it bears date on a Sunday.
    
    Compare: 1883 No 8 s 13

##### 14 Computation of time of payment
    
*   Where a bill is not payable on demand, the day on which it falls due is determined as follows:
        
    *   (a) The bill is due and payable in all cases on the last day of the time of payment as fixed by the bill or, if that day is a non-business day, on the next following business day:
    
    *   (b) Where a bill is payable at a fixed period after date, after sight, or after the happening of a specified event, the time of payment is determined by excluding the day from which the time is to begin to run and by including the day of payment.
    
    *   (c) Where a bill is payable at a fixed period after sight, the time begins to run from the date of the acceptance if the bill is accepted, and from the date of noting or protest if the bill is noted or protested for non-acceptance or for non-delivery.
    
    *   (d) The term _month_ in a bill means calendar month.
    
    Compare: 1883 No 8 s 14
    
    Paragraph (a) was substituted, as from 1 January 1980, by section [3(1)][119] Bills of Exchange Amendment Act 1979 (1979 No 3). Under section 3(3) of that Act, the new paragraph (a) applies only to bills drawn on 1 January 1980 and later.

##### 15 Referee in case of need
    
*   The drawer of a bill and any indorser may insert therein the name of a person to whom the holder may resort in case of need---that is to say, in case the bill is dishonoured by non-acceptance or non-payment. Such person is called the referee in case of need. It is in the option of the holder to resort to the referee in case of need or not, as he thinks fit.
    
    Compare: 1883 No 8 s 15

##### 16 Optional stipulations by drawer or indorser
    
*   The drawer of a bill, and any indorser, may insert therein an express stipulation---
        
    *   (a) Negativing or limiting his own liability to the holder:
    
    *   (b) Waiving as regards himself some or all of the holder's duties.
    
    Compare: 1883 No 8 s 16

##### 17 Definition and requisites of acceptance
    
*   (1) The acceptance of a bill is the signification by the drawee of his assent to the order of the drawer.
    
    (2) An acceptance is invalid unless it complies with the following conditions, namely:
        
    *   (a) It must be written on the bill and be signed by the drawee; the mere signature of the drawee without additional words is sufficient:
    
    *   (b) It must not state that the drawee will perform his promise by any other means than the payment of money.
    
    Compare: 1883 No 8 s 17

##### 18 Time for acceptance
    
*   (1) A bill may be accepted---
        
    *   (a) Before it has been signed by the drawer or while otherwise incomplete:
    
    *   (b) When it is overdue, or after it has been dishonoured by a previous refusal to accept, or by non-payment.
    
    (2) Where a bill payable after sight is dishonoured by non-acceptance, and the drawee subsequently accepts it, the holder, in the absence of any different agreement, is entitled to have the bill accepted as on the date of its first presentment to the drawee for acceptance.
    
    Compare: 1883 No 8 s 18

##### 19 General and qualified acceptances
    
*   (1) An acceptance is either (a) general, or (b) qualified.
    
    (2) A general acceptance assents without qualification to the order of the drawer: a qualified acceptance in express terms varies the effect of the bill as drawn.
    
    (3) In particular, an acceptance is qualified which is---
        
    *   (a) Conditional---that is to say, which makes payment by the acceptor dependent on the fulfilment of a condition therein stated:
    
    *   (b) Partial---that is to say, an acceptance to pay part only of the amount for which the bill is drawn:
    
    *   (c) Local---that is to say, an acceptance to pay only at a particular specified place. An acceptance to pay at a particular place is a general acceptance, unless it expressly states that the bill is to be paid there only and not elsewhere:
    
    *   (d) Qualified as to time:
    
    *   (e) The acceptance of some one or more of the drawees, but not of all.
    
    Compare: 1883 No 8 s 19

##### 20 Inchoate instruments
    
*   (1) Where a simple signature on a blank stamped paper is delivered by the signer in order that it may be converted into a bill, it operates as a _prima facie_ authority to fill it up as a complete bill for any amount the stamp will cover, using the signature for that of the drawer, or the acceptor, or an indorser; and in like manner, where a bill is wanting in any material particular, the person in possession of it has a _prima facie_ authority to fill up the omission in any way he thinks fit.
    
    (2) In order that any such instrument when completed may be enforceable against any person who became a party thereto prior to its completion, it must be filled up within a reasonable time, and strictly in accordance with the authority given. Reasonable time for this purpose is a question of fact:
    
    Provided that if any such instrument after completion is negotiated to a holder in due course, it shall be valid and effectual for all purposes in his hands, and he may enforce it as if it had been filled up within a reasonable time and strictly in accordance with the authority given.
    
    Compare: 1883 No 8 s 20

##### 21 Delivery
    
*   (1) Every contract on a bill, whether it is the drawer's, the acceptor's, or an indorser's, is incomplete and revocable until delivery of the instrument in order to give effect thereto:
    
    Provided that where an acceptance is written on a bill, and the drawee gives notice to or according to the directions of the person entitled to the bill that he has accepted it, the acceptance then becomes complete and irrevocable.
    
    (2) As between immediate parties, and as regards a remote party other than the holder in due course, the delivery---
        
    *   (a) In order to be effectual must be made either by or under the authority of the party drawing, accepting, or indorsing, as the case may be:
    
    *   (b) May be shown to have been conditional, or for a special purpose only, and not for the purpose of transferring the property in the bill.
    
    (3) If the bill is in the hands of a holder in due course, a valid delivery of the bill by all parties prior to him so as to make them liable to him is conclusively presumed.
    
    (4) Where a bill is no longer in the possession of a party who has signed it as drawer, acceptor, or indorser, a valid and unconditional delivery by him is presumed until the contrary is proved.
    
    Compare: 1883 No 8 s 21

#### Capacity and authority of parties

##### 22 Capacity of parties
    
*   (1) Capacity to incur liability as a party to a bill is co-extensive with capacity to contract:
    
    Provided that nothing in this section shall enable a corporation to make itself liable as a drawer, acceptor, or indorser of a bill unless it is competent to it so to do under the law for the time being in force relating to corporations.
    
    (2) Where a bill is drawn or indorsed by a minor or corporation, having no capacity or power to incur liability on a bill, the drawing or indorsement entitles the holder to receive payment of the bill and to enforce it against any other party thereto.
    
    Compare: 1883 No 8 s 22

##### 23 Signature essential to liability
    
*   No person is liable as drawer, indorser, or acceptor of a bill unless he has signed it as such:
    
    Provided that---
        
    *   (a) Where a person signs a bill in a trade or assumed name, he is liable thereon as if he had signed it in his own name:
    
    *   (b) The signature of the name of a firm is equivalent to the signature by the person so signing of the names of all persons liable as partners in that firm.
    
    Compare: 1883 No 8 s 23

##### 24 Forged or unauthorised signature
    
*   (1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, where a signature on a bill is forged, or is placed thereon without the authority of the person whose signature it purports to be, the forged or unauthorised signature is wholly inoperative, and no right to retain the bill or to give a discharge therefor or to enforce payment thereof against any party thereto can be acquired through or under that signature, unless the party against whom it is sought to retain or enforce payment of the bill is precluded from setting up the forgery or want of authority.
    
    (2) Nothing in this section shall affect the ratification of an unauthorised signature not amounting to a forgery.
    
    Compare: 1883 No 8 s 24

##### 25 Signature by procuration
    
*   A signature by procuration operates as notice that the agent has but a limited authority to sign, and the principal is bound by such signature only if the agent in so signing was acting within the actual limits of his authority.
    
    Compare: 1883 No 8 s 25

##### 26 Person signing as agent or representative
    
*   (1) Where a person signs a bill as drawer, indorser, or acceptor, and adds words to his signature indicating that he signs for or on behalf of a principal, or in a representative character, he is not personally liable thereon; but the mere addition to his signature of words describing him as an agent, or as filling a representative character, does not exempt him from personal liability.
    
    (2) In determining whether a signature on a bill is that of the principal, or that of the agent by whose hand it is written, the construction most favourable to the validity of the instrument shall be adopted.
    
    Compare: 1883 No 8 s 26

#### The consideration for a bill

##### 27 Value, and holder for value
    
*   (1) Valuable consideration for a bill may be constituted by---
        
    *   (a) Any consideration sufficient to support a simple contract:
    
    *   (b) An antecedent debt or liability. Such a debt or liability is deemed valuable consideration whether the bill is payable on demand or at future time.
    
    (2) Where value has at any time been given for a bill, the holder is deemed to be a holder for value as regards the acceptor and all parties to the bill who became parties prior to that time.
    
    (3) Where the holder of a bill has a lien on it, arising either from contract or by implication of law, he is deemed to be a holder for value to the amount of the sum for which he has a lien.
    
    Compare: 1883 No 8 s 27

##### 28 Accommodation party
    
*   (1) An accommodation party to a bill is a person who has signed a bill as drawer, acceptor, or indorser without receiving value therefor, and for the purpose of lending his name to some other person.
    
    (2) An accommodation party is liable on the bill to a holder for value; and it is immaterial whether, when such holder took the bill, he knew such party to be an accommodation party or not.
    
    Compare: 1883 No 8 s 28

##### 29 Holder in due course
    
*   (1) A holder in due course is a holder who has taken a bill, complete and regular on the face of it, under the following conditions, namely:
        
    *   (a) That he became the holder of it before it was overdue, and without notice that it had been previously dishonoured, if such was the fact:
    
    *   (b) That he took the bill in good faith and for value, and that at the time the bill was negotiated to him he had no notice of any defect in the title of the person who negotiated it.
    
    (2) In particular, the title of a person who negotiates a bill is defective within the meaning of this Act when he obtained the bill, or the acceptance thereof, by fraud, duress, or force and fear, or other unlawful means, or for an illegal consideration, or when he negotiates it in breach of faith, or under such circumstances as amount to a fraud.
    
    (3) A holder (whether for value or not) who derives his title to a bill through a holder in due course, and who is not himself a party to any fraud or illegality affecting it, has all the rights of that holder in due course as regards the acceptor and all parties to the bill prior to that holder.
    
    Compare: 1883 No 8 s 29

##### 30 Presumption of value and good faith
    
*   (1) Every party whose signature appears on a bill is prima facie deemed to have become a party thereto for value.
    
    (2) Every holder of a bill is prima facie deemed to be a holder in due course; but if in an action on a bill it is admitted or proved---
        
    *   (a) That the acceptance, issue, or subsequent negotiation of the bill is affected with fraud, duress, or force and fear, or illegality; or
    
    *   (b) That the bill was drawn as part of, or pursuant to, a credit contract and that one or more of the provisions of the [Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act 2003][120] have not been complied with, or that section [120(a)][121], [(b)][121], or [(c)][121] of that Act applies, in respect of the contract---
    
    the burden of proof is shifted, unless and until the holder proves that,---
        
    *   (c) In any case to which paragraph [(a)][34] of this subsection applies, subsequent to the alleged fraud or illegality, value has in good faith been given for the bill; and
    
    *   (d) In any case to which paragraph [(b)][34] of this subsection applies, value has been given for the bill in good faith and without knowledge of the non-compliance or any oppressiveness.
    
    Compare: 1883 No 8 s 30
    
    Subsection (2) was substituted, as from 1 June 1982, by section 50 Credit Contracts Act 1981 (1981 No 27).
    
    Subsection (2)(b) was amended, as from 1 April 2005, by section [139][122] Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act 2003 (2003 No 52) by substituting the words ""Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act 2003 have not been complied with, or that section 120(a), (b), or (c) of that Act applies"" for the words ""Credit Contracts Act 1981 have not been complied with, or that any of paragraphs (a) to (c) of section 10(1) of that Act apply"". _See_ sections [141 to 143][123] of that Act as to the transitional provisions.

#### Negotiation of bills

##### 31 Negotiation of bill
    
*   (1) A bill is negotiated when it is transferred from one person to another in such a manner as to constitute the transferee the holder of the bill.
    
    (2) A bill payable to bearer is negotiated by delivery.
    
    (3) A bill payable to order is negotiated by the indorsement of the holder completed by delivery.
    
    (4) Where the holder of a bill payable to his order transfers it for value without indorsing it, the transfer gives the transferee such title as the transferor had in the bill, and the transferee in addition acquires the right to have the indorsement of the transferor.
    
    (5) Where any person is under obligation to indorse a bill in a representative capacity, he may indorse the bill in such terms as to negative personal liability.
    
    Compare: 1883 No 8 s 31

##### 32 Requisition of a valid indorsement
    
*   An indorsement in order to operate as a negotiation must comply with the following conditions, namely:
        
    *   (a) It must be written on the bill itself and be signed by the indorser; the simple signature of the indorser on the bill, without additional words, is sufficient:
        
        Provided that an indorsement written on an allonge, or on a **copy** of a bill issued or negotiated in a country where **copies** are recognised, shall be deemed to be written on the bill itself.
    
    *   (b) It must be an indorsement of the entire bill. A partial indorsement---that is to say, an indorsement that purports to transfer to the indorsee a part only of the amount payable, or to transfer the bill to 2 or more indorsees severally---does not operate as a negotiation of the bill.
    
    *   (c) Where a bill is payable to the order of 2 or more payees or indorsees who are not partners, all must indorse, unless the one indorsing has authority to indorse for the others.
    
    *   (d) Where in a bill payable to order the payee or indorsee is wrongly designated, or his name is misspelt, he may indorse the bill as therein described, adding, if he thinks fit, his proper signature.
    
    *   (e) Where there are 2 or more indorsements on a bill, each indorsement is deemed to have been made in the order in which it appears on the bill, until the contrary is proved.
    
    *   (f) An indorsement may be either special or in blank; it may also contain terms making it restrictive.
    
    Compare: 1883 No 8 s 32

##### 33 Conditional indorsement
    
*   Where a bill purports to be indorsed conditionally, the condition may be disregarded by the payer, and payment to the indorsee is valid whether the condition has been fulfilled or not.
    
    Compare: 1883 No 8 s 33

##### 34 Indorsement in blank, and special indorsement
    
*   (1) An indorsement in blank specifies no indorsee, and a bill so indorsed becomes payable to bearer.
    
    (2) A special indorsement specifies the person to whom, or to whose order, the bill is to be payable.
    
    (3) The provisions of this Act relating to a payee apply, with the necessary modifications, to an indorsee under a special indorsement.
    
    (4) Where a bill has been indorsed in blank, any holder may convert the blank indorsement into a special indorsement by writing above the indorser's signature a direction to pay the bill to or to the order of himself or some other person.
    
    Compare: 1883 No 8 s 34

##### 35 Restrictive indorsement
    
*   (1) An indorsement is restrictive which prohibits the further negotiation of the bill, or which expresses that it is a mere authority to deal with the bill as thereby directed and not a transfer of the ownership thereof---as, for example, if a bill is indorsed ""Pay D. only"", or ""Pay D. for the account of X."", or ""Pay D. or order for collection"".
    
    (2) A restrictive indorsement gives the indorsee the right to receive payment of the bill, and to sue any party thereto that his indorser could have sued, but gives him no power to transfer his rights as indorsee unless it expressly authorises him to do so.
    
    (3) Where a restrictive indorsement authorises further transfer, all subsequent indorsees take the bill with the same rights and subject to the same liabilities as the first indorsee under the restrictive indorsement.
    
    Compare: 1883 No 8 s 35

##### 36 Negotiation of overdue or dishonoured bill
    
*   (1) Where a bill is negotiable in its origin, it continues to be negotiable until it has been either restrictively indorsed, or discharged by payment or otherwise.
    
    (2) Where an overdue bill is negotiated, it can be negotiated only subject to any defect of title affecting it at its maturity, and thenceforward no person who takes it can acquire or give a better title than that which the person from whom he took it had.
    
    (3) A bill payable on demand is deemed to be overdue within the meaning and for the purposes of this section when it appears on the face of it to have been in circulation for an unreasonable length of time. What is an unreasonable length of time for this purpose is a question of fact.
    
    (4) Except where an indorsement bears date after the maturity of the bill, every negotiation is prima facie deemed to have been effected before the bill became overdue.
    
    (5) Where a bill that is not overdue has been dishonoured, any person who takes it with notice of the dishonour takes it subject to any defect of title attaching thereto at the time of dishonour; but nothing in this subsection shall affect the rights of a holder in due course.
    
    Compare: 1883 No 8 s 36

##### 37 Negotiation of bill to party already liable thereon
    
*   Where a bill is negotiated back to the drawer, or to a prior indorser, or to the acceptor, such party may, subject to the provisions of this Act, reissue and further negotiate the bill; but he is not entitled to enforce payment of the bill against any intervening party to whom he was previously liable.
    
    Compare: 1883 No 8 s 37

##### 38 Rights of the holder
    
*   The rights and powers of the holder of a bill are as follow:
        
    *   (a) He may sue on the bill in his own name:
    
    *   (b) Where he is a holder in due course, he holds the bill free from any defect of title of prior parties, as well as from mere personal defences available to prior parties among themselves, and may enforce payment against all parties liable on the bill:
    
    *   (c) Where his title is defective,---
            
        *   (i) If he negotiates the bill to a holder in due course, that holder obtains a good and complete title to the bill; and
        
        *   (ii) If he obtains payment of the bill, the person who pays him in due course gets a valid discharge for the bill.
        
        
    
    Compare: 1883 No 8 s 38

#### General duties of the holder

##### 39 When presentment for acceptance is necessary
    
*   (1) Where a bill is payable after sight, presentment for acceptance is necessary in order to fix the maturity of the instrument.
    
    (2) Where a bill expressly stipulates that it shall be presented for acceptance, or where a bill is drawn payable elsewhere than at the residence or place of business of the drawee, it must be presented for acceptance before it can be presented for payment.
    
    (3) In no other case is presentment for acceptance necessary in order to render liable any party to the bill.
    
    (4) Where the holder of a bill drawn payable elsewhere than at the place of business or residence of the drawee has not time, with the exercise of reasonable diligence, to present the bill for acceptance before presenting it for payment on the day that it falls due, the delay caused by presenting the bill for acceptance before presenting it for payment is excused, and does not discharge the drawer and indorsers.
    
    Compare: 1883 No 8 s 39

##### 40 Time for presenting bill payable after sight
    
*   (1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, where a bill payable after sight is negotiated, the holder must either present it for acceptance or negotiate it within a reasonable time.
    
    (2) If he does not do so, the drawer and all indorsers prior to that holder are discharged to the extent that they are prejudiced by the omission.
    
    (3) In determining what is a reasonable time within the meaning of this section, regard shall be had to the nature of the bill, the usage of trade with respect to similar bills, and the facts of the particular case.
    
    Compare: 1883 No 8 s 40
    
    Subsection (2) was substituted, as from 1 January 1980, by section [4(1)][124] Bills of Exchange Amendment Act 1979 (1979 No 3).

    *   (d) Where the drawee is bankrupt, presentment may be made to him or to his assignee:
    
    *   (da) Where the drawee is a body corporate that is being wound up, presentment may be made to the body corporate itself or to the liquidator:
    
    *   (e) Where authorised by agreement or usage, a presentment through the post office is sufficient:
    
    (2) Presentment in accordance with these rules is excused, and a bill may be treated as dishonoured by non-acceptance,---
        
    *   (f) Where the drawee is dead or bankrupt, or is a fictitious person, or a person not having capacity to contract by bill:
    
    *   (fa) Where the drawee is a body corporate that is being wound up:
    
    *   (g) Where, after the exercise of reasonable diligence, such presentment cannot be affected:
    
    *   (h) Where, although the presentment has been irregular, acceptance has been refused on some other ground.
    
    (3) The fact that the holder has reason to believe that the bill, on presentment, will be dishonoured does not excuse presentment.

    Subsection (1)(da) was inserted, as from 1 January 1980, by section [5(1)][125] Bills of Exchange Amendment Act 1979 (1979 No 3).

    Section 42 was amended, as from 1 January 1980, by section [4(2)][124] Bills of Exchange Amendment Act 1979 (1979 No 3), by inserting the words ""to the extent that they are prejudiced by the omission"".

    (2) Where a qualified acceptance is taken, and the drawer or an indorser has not expressly or impliedly authorised the holder to take a qualified acceptance, or does not subsequently assent thereto, such drawer or indorser is discharged from his liability on the bill. The provisions of this subsection do not apply to a partial acceptance whereof due notice has been given. Where a foreign bill has been accepted as to part, it must be protested as to the balance.
    
    (3) Where the drawer or indorser of a bill receives notice of a qualified acceptance, and does not within a reasonable time express his dissent to the holder, he shall be deemed to have assented thereto.

        In determining what is a reasonable time regard shall be had to the nature of the bill, the usage of trade with regard to similar bills, and the facts of the particular case.
    
    *   (c) Presentment must be made by the holder, or by some person authorised to receive payment on his behalf, at a reasonable hour on a business day, at the proper place as hereinafter defined, either to the person designated by the bill as payer, or to some person authorised to pay or refuse payment on his behalf, if by the exercise of reasonable diligence such person can there be found.
