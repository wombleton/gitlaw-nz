## Part 2  
Complaints

##### 5 Principles
    
*   This Part is based on the following principles:
        
    *   (a) broadcasters have a responsibility to deal with complaints relating to broadcasts and must establish a proper procedure to deal with them:
    
    *   (b) a body other than the broadcaster must be available to complainants to ensure that broadcasters discharge their responsibilities in relation to programme standards:
    
    *   (c) complaints based merely on a complainant's preferences are not, in general, capable of being resolved by a complaints procedure:
    
    *   (d) an independent complaints procedure is not a substitute for proper consideration of complaints by the broadcaster:
    
    *   (e) complaints should be made promptly to the broadcaster:
    
    *   (f) formal complaints must be made in writing:
    
    *   (g) most complaints that are capable of being resolved by an independent complaints procedure should not be required to be resolved by that procedure but should be capable of being resolved by proper consideration and proper response on the part of the broadcaster:
    
    *   (h) the first consideration of a complaint should be prompt and without undue formality:
    
    *   (i) further consideration of a complaint calls for greater formality.
    
    Compare: 1976 No 132 s 95A(b)--(j); 1982 No 6 s 11

##### 6 Formal complaints about programmes
    
*   (1) Subject to subsection (2), it is the duty of every broadcaster---
        
    *   (a) to receive and consider formal complaints about any programme broadcast by it where the complaint constitutes, in respect of that programme, an allegation that the broadcaster has failed to comply with [section 4][6]; and
    
    *   (b) to publicise the procedures for making such complaints; and
    
    *   (ba) to broadcast on each channel or broadcasting station operated by the broadcaster notices (each of which shall be of at least 15 seconds' duration) publicising the procedure for making such complaints,---
            
        *   (i) with the equivalent in each year of 1 notice per day for each day of broadcasting on the channel or broadcasting station; and
        
        *   (ii) with the notices being broadcast at different programming times but in such a manner that the notices are broadcast in the course of a year at all programming times, including prime time and children's programming times; and
        
        
    
    *   (c) to establish procedures for investigating such complaints.
    
    (2) Nothing in this section requires a broadcaster to receive and consider any complaint that is not lodged in writing with the broadcaster within 20 working days after the date on which the programme to which the complaint relates was broadcast by the broadcaster.
    
    (3) Notwithstanding subsection (2), a broadcaster must consider a complaint if---
        
    *   (a) the complainant has resubmitted the complaint in writing within 30 working days after the date on which the programme to which the complaint relates was broadcast by the broadcaster; and
    
    *   (b) the complainant offers reasonable proof that the original complaint was lodged in accordance with subsection (2).
