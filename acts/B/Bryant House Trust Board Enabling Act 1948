    And whereas the aforesaid deed of trust declared that the said lands and chattels and moneys (together with the increase and proceeds of the said stock and implements and the said moneys) should be held by the trustees and their successors in perpetuity upon trust for the purposes of a convalescent home for children:
    
    And whereas by a supplemental deed bearing date 4 February 1929 the trustees were given the further power to purchase any freehold or leasehold lands and to purchase any livestock, chattels, choses-in-action, or personal property:
    
    And whereas, in pursuance of the said power, the trustees purchased a freehold farm property near Te Kuiti, together with certain livestock and implements:
    
    And whereas the said trustees were on 7 June 1946 duly incorporated under the provisions of the Religious, Charitable, and Educational Trusts Act 1908 as a Trust Board with the name or title of the Bryant House Trust Board:

    And whereas the Bryant House Trust Board is desirous of transferring to the Mary Bryant Trust Board the aforesaid farm property near Te Kuiti, together with all live and dead stock on the said farm property as at 30 April 1948 and all moneys standing to the credit of the Bryant House Trust Board in its Bryant House Te Kuiti Account in the Bank of New South Wales at Hamilton as on 30 April 1948 for the purpose of providing a fund for the establishment and maintenance of the said home for children in the City of Hamilton:
    
    And whereas the Bryant House Trust Board, under the aforesaid deed of trust dated 17 November 1924, has no power to dispose of the said assets in the manner aforesaid and is desirous that statutory authority should be given to empower the Bryant House Trust Board to make such transfer:
    
    And whereas the Bryant House Trust Board will, after transferring the above-described Te Kuiti assets and the Bryant House Te Kuiti Account in the Bank of New South Wales at Hamilton, have sufficient assets remaining to carry on the original trusts declared and imposed by the said deed of trust dated 17 November 1924\.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Bryant House Trust Board Enabling Act 1948\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 23 October 1948, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][8] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][9] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][10] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][11] and [17E][12] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
