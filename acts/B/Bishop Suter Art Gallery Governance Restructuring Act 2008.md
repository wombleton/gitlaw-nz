*   #### Preamble
    
    (1) By a Deed of Conveyance dated 11 May 1895, Amelia Damaris Suter conveyed land to trustees named in the deed to be held on trust for the promotion of art in the City of Nelson as they from time to time should think best and in particular for a site for and otherwise for the establishment and endowment of an art gallery for the people of the City of Nelson to be called the Bishop Suter Art Gallery:
    
    (2) By the [Bishop Suter Art Gallery Trustees Act 1896][17] further land was vested in the trustees on the same trusts:
    
    (3) The trustees became incorporated as a Board under [Part 2][18] of the Charitable Trusts Act 1957 under the name of the Bishop Suter Art Gallery Trust Board:
    
    (4) The Bishop Suter Art Gallery Trust Board lacks governance powers to conduct its affairs properly and is unable within its rules to correct the position:
    
    (5) The Bishop Suter Art Gallery Trust Board wishes to ensure the future of the Suter Art Gallery and the protection of the art collection by local authority control and funding:
    
    (6) The Bishop Suter Trust, incorporated as a Board under [Part 2][18] of the Charitable Trusts Act 1957 and being a council-controlled organisation of the Nelson City Council, should be recognised to carry on the functions of the Bishop Suter Art Gallery Trust Board with extended objects and powers:
    
    (7) The Bishop Suter Art Gallery Trust Board should be dissolved:
    
    (8) The property, rights, and obligations of the Bishop Suter Art Gallery Trust Board should be vested in The Bishop Suter Trust:
    
    (9) The [Bishop Suter Art Gallery Trustees Act 1896][17] should be repealed:
    
    (10) The change to a council-controlled organisation raises doubts about the liability of The Bishop Suter Trust and the Nelson City Council in respect of benefits received by the Bishop Suter Art Gallery Trust Board from The Suter 2000 Appeal Trust pursuant to the Funding Agreement:
    
    (11) The objects of this Act cannot be attained otherwise than by legislation:

The Parliament of New Zealand therefore enacts as follows:
