    (3) The fact that [Part 5A][205] provides for levies to be made to fund readiness or response activities does not prevent this section imposing a levy to which both the following apply:
        
    *   (a) it is imposed to wholly or partly fund a readiness or response activity; and
    
    *   (b) it is imposed on a sector that is not specified in a _Gazette_ notice under [section 100ZA][209].
