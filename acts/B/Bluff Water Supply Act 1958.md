*   (1) The City Council shall for the purposes of carrying out the terms of this agreement be the Water Supply Authority and shall construct and maintain a water supply pipeline from its existing waterworks within the City to a point (to be agreed upon) within the boundary of the Bluff Borough, such pipeline to be of a nominal internal diameter of ten inches (10″).

*   (2) The City Council shall immediately apply for the necessary authority to raise a loan of sufficient money to construct the said pipeline, and shall raise such moneys when authority is granted and shall supply to all parties to this agreement an Audited detailed statement of loan disbursements.

    *   (b) The cost of maintenance of the said pipeline by the City Council (including losses of water in course of transit). The City Council agrees to debit the said account with only the actual maintenance costs for the first five years, but after that period maintenance will be charged at the rate of 1% of the actual cost of the pipeline.
    
    

*   (4) The City Council shall supply the parties hereto and all other consumers with such quantities of water as such parties and other consumers within their districts shall require (within the capacity of the said pipeline augmented when necessary by additional pumping equipment) for the price of elevenpence (11d.) per thousand gallons for a period of five years from the commencement of supply, and thereafter at such price as shall be agreed upon between the parties following the completion of negotiations or arbitration as set out in Clause 13 of this agreement.
    
    As Water Supply Authority the City Council shall ensure that any bulk draw-off from the pipeline shall not cause the delivery pressure to fall below 2 lbs/sq. inch at the end of the pipeline as defined in Clause 1 hereof.

    The quantity of water so drawn from the Bluff Borough Council and the rate of the draw off shall be limited so as not to reduce the Bluff Borough Council storage or pressure to a dangerous level. The dangerous level is defined as a storage of less than 2,000,000 gallons and a pressure at the Bluff Borough Council yard of less than 50 lbs per square inch steady pressure. Other consumers requirements shall be restricted to their minimum needs during any such period of emergency.

*   (9) The County Council hereby guarantees and agrees with the City Council that it will in each of the first five years from the commencement of supply of water hereunder pay to the City Council by way of user payment a minimum of One hundred pounds (£100). This amount of the user payment made annually by the Southland County Council shall be reduced by the sum of all of the user payments received annually by the Supply Authority from users who are ratepayers of the Southland County Council other than the Southland Co-operative Phosphate Company who is a party to this agreement.

*   (10) The water supplied to consumers between the boundaries of the City and the Bluff Borough shall be metered at the point of supply on the main pipeline and the water supplied to the Bluff Borough Council shall be metered at the point where the main pipeline crosses the Bluff Borough boundary or at such point within the said boundary as shall be agreed upon between the City Council and the Bluff Borough Council, and the City Council shall be entitled to charge the users concerned reasonable meter rents for meters so installed.

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][11] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][13] and [17E][14] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
