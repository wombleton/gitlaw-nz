*   (4) The City Council shall supply the parties hereto and all other consumers with such quantities of water as such parties and other consumers within their districts shall require (within the capacity of the said pipeline augmented when necessary by additional pumping equipment) for the price of elevenpence (11d.) per thousand gallons for a period of five years from the commencement of supply, and thereafter at such price as shall be agreed upon between the parties following the completion of negotiations or arbitration as set out in Clause 13 of this agreement.
    
    As Water Supply Authority the City Council shall ensure that any bulk draw-off from the pipeline shall not cause the delivery pressure to fall below 2 lbs/sq. inch at the end of the pipeline as defined in Clause 1 hereof.

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][11] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][13] and [17E][14] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:

        *   â€¢indentation
        *   â€¢position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   â€¢format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)

    *   â€¢position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   â€¢punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   â€¢Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   â€¢case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   â€¢format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   â€¢small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
