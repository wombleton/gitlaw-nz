##### 17 Providing for the apportionment of levies made by the Auckland Regional Authority between the wards of the City of Takapuna
    
*   Whereas by Order in Council made on 22 July 1974 and published in the _Gazette_ on 25 July 1974 at pages 1529 to 1532 (in this section referred to as the **Order**), the ridings of Glenfield and Albany were excluded from the County of Waitemata and included in the City of Takapuna: 
    
    And whereas clause 6 of the Order provides, inter alia, that for a period of 10 years from 1 August 1974 the levies charged and assessed by the Auckland Regional Authority (in this section referred to as the **Authority**) shall be apportioned by the Takapuna City Council to the wards of Takapuna, Glenfield, and Albany, as nearly as practicable, in accordance with the statutory formulae provided by the [Auckland Regional Authority Act 1963][25] (in this section referred to as the **Act**): 
    
    And whereas it is desirable to give effect to that provision: 
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    (1) This section shall be deemed to have come into force on 1 August 1974, and shall apply to all assessments made by the Authority pursuant to the Act upon the mayor, councillors, and citizens of the City of Takapuna (in this section referred to as the **Corporation**) for any period subsequent to 31 March 1975 until 31 July 1984\.
    
    (2) The assessments to which this section applies shall be made, by and at the discretion of the Authority, either---
        
    *   (a) by dividing the assessments into 3 groups as if each of the wards of Takapuna, Glenfield, and Albany was a contributing local authority as defined in [section 2][26] of the Act, and as nearly as possible in accordance with the provisions of the Act as those provisions would have applied to the City of Takapuna and the ridings of Glenfield and Albany of the County of Waitemata as each was constituted immediately before the commencement of this section; or
    
    *   (b) by not dividing the assessments, but by giving the Corporation sufficient information with the assessments as to enable the Corporation to make the same division as is referred to in paragraph (a).
    
    (3) Notwithstanding subsection (2), all assessments upon the Corporation shall, for all the purposes of the Act, be assessments charged against the Corporation and shall be subject to appeal and be payable by, and recoverable from, the Corporation.
    
    (4) Where for the purposes of this section it is necessary to ascertain or calculate the rateable capital value or population of any ward of the City of Takapuna, such value or population shall, upon receipt of a written request from the Authority, be ascertained or calculated by the Valuer-General or, as the case may require, the Government Statistician, as at a date or dates as near as reasonably practicable to the date of the receipt of the request.
    
    (5) The Corporation shall not exercise the power conferred by [section 66(b)][27] of the Act during the period to which subsection (1) of this section applies, but the Corporation shall, for that period, through its Council strike and collect in each of the said wards a rate for such an amount in the dollar on the value of all rateable property within such ward as shall be sufficient to pay that ward's share of the said assessments and interest thereon (if any) and the costs of and incidental to the making and collection thereof, and it shall be entitled to make and levy such rate in addition to all rates which it is entitled to make and levy under any other Act, and notwithstanding any provision in any other Act limiting or in any way affecting the rating power of the said Corporation.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Local Legislative Act 1973\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 9 November 1974, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][28] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][29] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][30] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][31] and [17E][32] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
