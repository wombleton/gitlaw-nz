    (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 69 of the Hospitals Act 1957, the Board may, without further authority than this section, sell to the Council for the sum of 30,000 pounds the lands described in subsection (6) and may accept payment of that sum in debentures to the value of 30,000 pounds issued by the Council under the loan, or partly in cash and partly in debentures issued under the loan to the value of such part of that sum as is not paid in cash, and on the sale of those lands all trusts and reservations theretofore affecting the same shall be deemed to be cancelled.
    
    (2) The proceeds derived by the Board from the sale of the said lands and from the redemption of the said debentures shall be held and applied by the Board in the manner provided by subsection (2) of section 69 of the Hospitals Act 1957\.
    
    (3) The said lands shall be held by the Council for housing purposes pursuant to the Municipal Corporations Act 1954\.
    
    (4) Notwithstanding anything contained in this section or in any other enactment, where the Council at any time considers that any part or parts of the said lands are unsuitable for housing purposes, the Council may, instead of disposing of that part or parts in accordance with the provisions of the Municipal Corporations Act 1954, by resolution decide that that part or parts shall be subject to the Northcote Borough Empowering Act 1956 and thereupon the provisions of that Act shall apply in all respects as if that part or parts were included in Schedule 1 of that Act.
    
    (5) The District Land Registrar for the Land Registration District of Auckland is hereby authorised and directed to accept such documents for registration and to do all such things as may be necessary to give effect to this section.

    And whereas by reason of certain unexpected difficulties encountered in the execution of the said work the contractors have suffered a loss:
    
    And whereas the Board has paid to the contractors sums not covered by the terms of the said agreements of 139 pounds 10 shillings, 475 pounds 3 shillings, 976 pounds 19 shillings and 9 pence, 700 pounds, and 1,444 pounds 3 shillings, respectively:
    
    And whereas it is desirable to validate the said payments made by the Board:

##### 24 Provision with respect to transfer of administration of Poukawa Drainage Area to Hawke's Bay Catchment Board
    
*   Whereas the Poukawa Drainage Area (in this section referred to as the _area_) was constituted under the Swamp Drainage Act 1915 by Order in Council gazetted on 27 April 1916 at page 1194:
    
    And whereas the amount of the rates that are necessary for the maintenance and capital charges in respect of the drainage works already constructed in the area (in this section referred to as the _drainage works_) greatly exceeds the maximum rates which a Catchment Board may make and levy under the [Soil Conservation and Rivers Control Act 1941][36] (in this section referred to as the _Act_):
    
    And whereas it is expedient that the drainage works and the care, control, and management thereof be vested in the Hawke's Bay Catchment Board (in this section referred to as the _Board_):
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    (1) The drainage works and the care, control, and management thereof shall vest in the Board on 1 April 1959, and the area shall cease to be a drainage area under the Swamp Drainage Act 1915, and shall thereafter be a defined portion of the Hawke's Bay Catchment District for all purposes relating to the construction and maintenance of the drainage works and shall be known as the Poukawa Special Rating Area.
    
    (2) Except in respect of an administrative rate, the limitations made upon the maximum rates which may be made and levied by a Catchment Board under the Act shall have no application to any rate made and levied by the Board within the Poukawa Special Rating Area.
    
    (3) The classification of the lands within the Poukawa Special Rating Area and the proportions fixed in relation thereto shall continue in force on and after 1 April 1959 as if they were a classification made and proportions fixed pursuant to the Act for the purposes of a separate rate upon all property liable to be rated within that portion of the district and the classification and proportions shall thereupon be in force as if made for the purposes aforesaid by the Board under the Act, and shall continue in force until determined by the Board by express resolution in that behalf.
    
    (4) In every other respect the provisions of the Act shall, on and after 1 April 1959, apply to and be observed in respect of the Poukawa Special Rating Area as part of the Hawke's Bay Catchment District.
    
    (5) On and after 1 April 1959 the debts, liabilities, engagements, powers, and functions of the Minister of Lands in respect of the area shall be the debts, liabilities, engagements, powers, and functions of the Board.
    
    (6) As soon as possible after 1 April 1959 the Board shall execute in favour of Her Majesty the Queen a debenture securing to Her Majesty the amount being the part of the cost of the drainage works which has not already been recouped by the Minister of Lands together with interest thereon as hereinafter specified as from 1 April 1959\.
    
    (7) The amount referred to in subsection (6) shall be fixed by the Minister of Lands and the Board and, failing agreement, shall be determined by the Audit Office.
    
    (8) The rate of interest shall be four and a half per cent per annum or such other rate as may from time to time be fixed in that behalf by the Minister of Finance.
    
    (9) The sum so secured shall be paid by the Board to the Minister of Lands by equal annual instalments payable on or before the last day of February in the financial year to which the payment relates over a period of 23 years commencing with 1 April 1959\.
    
    (10) The debenture shall be in a form approved by the Minister of Finance and shall be secured over and be a first charge on all lands and drainage works at any time owned by the Board in the area and all rates on lands in that area which are payable to the Board:
    
    provided that the debenture shall not be secured over any special rates made as security for any special loans raised by the Board.

##### 25 Authorising North Canterbury Catchment Board to make compensation payment
    
*   Whereas under the [Waimakariri River Improvement Act 1922][37] certain land in the Canterbury Land District, being more particularly described as all that piece of land containing 53 acres 3 roods 28 perches and seven-tenths of a perch, more or less, being part of Rural Section 1152 and being all that land on the northern side of the stop bank which runs through the property described in certificate of title, Volume 410, folio 162, Canterbury Registry, save and except those areas containing 11 acres and 33 perches which have already been purchased from John Christopher Dobby, of Ladbrooks, farmer, was vested in the Waimakariri River Trust:
    
    And whereas by Order in Council made on 13 February 1947 the Waimakariri River Trust was abolished and all the powers, duties, functions, assets, and liabilities of the said Trust were transferred to the North Canterbury Catchment Board (in this section referred to as the _Board_):
    
    And whereas the said John Christopher Dobby claims that the said land formed part of the land comprised and described in certificate of title, Volume 410, folio 162, Canterbury Registry, and that he was the registered proprietor therein named and that he was entitled to compensation for the taking thereof:
    
    And whereas no claims for compensation for the taking of the said land have been made within the time prescribed by law:
    
    And whereas the Board, being satisfied that the sum of 1,000 pounds together with reasonable legal expenses would have been properly payable as compensation for the taking of the said land if a claim therefor had been made within the prescribed time, is desirous of making payment of that sum:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    The Board is hereby authorised, notwithstanding that a claim is barred by lapse of time, to pay from its Waimakariri River Account to John Christopher Dobby, the sum of 1,000 pounds together with reasonable legal expenses in full satisfaction and discharge of all claims for compensation for the taking of the said land.

##### 26 Extending period during which classification for rating purposes of certain lands in Otago Catchment District shall continue in force
    
*   Whereas the Lower Clutha River Trust (in this section referred to as the _Trust_) has been dissolved and its powers and functions transferred to the Otago Catchment Board (in this section referred to as the _Board_):
    
    And whereas the Board has, since the dissolution of the Trust, continued to make and levy annual rates in the district of the Trust in accordance with the classification of the lands in that district previously used for rating purposes:
    
    And whereas, by subsection (3) of [section 10][38] of the Soil Conservation and Rivers Control Amendment Act 1946, the Board cannot, after the expiration of 6 years from the dissolution of the Trust, continue to exercise the powers of the Trust to make and levy the said rates other than as provided for in subsection (4) of section 13 of that Act:
    
    And whereas the said period of 6 years expired on 25 February 1958:
    
    And whereas, before the Board could continue after the said period of 6 years to make and levy rates in the said district, it would require to classify the lands in the said district pursuant to the provisions of [section 102][39] of the Soil Conservation and Rivers Control Act 1941, but no such classification has been carried out:
    
    And whereas the Board is desirous of continuing the classification that was in force in the district of the Trust as at the date of expiry of the said period of 6 years pending completion of a new classification of the said district:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    (1) The classification of lands for rating purposes in the district of the Trust as in force on 24 February 1958 and the proportions fixed in relation thereto shall continue and shall be deemed to have continued in full force and effect as if the classification had been made and the proportions had been fixed pursuant to the provisions of the [Soil Conservation and Rivers Control Act 1941][36], for a further period of 4 years commencing on 25 February 1958\.
    
    (2) All rates made and levied by the Board in the said district after the expiration of the said period of 6 years and before the commencement of this Act, using the said classification and proportions, shall be deemed to have been validly made and levied.

*   This is a reprint of the Local Legislation Act 1958\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 3 October 1958, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][40] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][41] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][42] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][43] and [17E][44] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
