    And whereas it is considered that the classification into Class A or Class B of the said marginal lands, because of the relationship of the potential benefit and the present valuation of the said marginal lands which benefit, cannot operate equitably:
    
    And whereas it is considered that it would be just and equitable that the owners of all or part of the said marginal lands held in private ownership and classified into Class A or Class B receiving the increment in value should contribute proportionately towards the cost of the Scheme in addition to such other rates and payments as may be lawfully demanded by the Board:
    
    And whereas the Board has, by agreements dated 29 March 1965, 2 September 1965, and 1 November 1965, entered into with the owners of the said marginal lands, namely with Lawrence George Moran, of Featherston, farmer, the New Zealand Insurance Company Limited, Clifford Ulric Plimmer, of Wellington, company director, the Maori Trustee, Gordon Regis Colman, of Martinborough, farmer, Ben Robert Lysaght Atkinson, of Featherston, farmer, Nancy Rose Adams, of Dannevirke, married woman, and Russell Winston Hume, of Pirinoa, farmer (in this section referred to as the **owners**) reached agreement with the owners as to the terms and method of payment of such additional contribution:
    
    And whereas the Board has no power to enter into the said agreements or to compel payment of such additional contribution from the owners:
    
    And whereas it is desirable that the said agreements should be validated:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    (1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the [Soil Conservation and Rivers Control Act 1941][60], the said agreements are hereby validated and confirmed, and the Board shall be deemed to have been at all times authorised and empowered to enter into and execute the said agreements, which shall be binding on the parties thereto and shall for all purposes, without further authority than this section, be effective according to their tenor.
    
    (2) The contributions payable under the said agreements by the owners shall be paid to the Board, and shall be applied by the Board in the carrying out of the works under the Scheme.
    
    (3) Subject to the provisions of the Rating Act 1925, the Board from time to time may in any court of competent jurisdiction recover the amount of those contributions from the owners of the lands affected by the said agreements for the time being as debts due by the respective owners to the Board, in the same manner as if the payment due were a rate levied under the provisions of the Rating Act 1925\.

##### 43 Validating agreement between Eastbourne Urban Fire Authority and Hutt Valley and Bays Fire Board
    
*   Whereas by Order in Council made on 8 September 1965 and published in the _Gazette_ on 9 September 1965, at page 1502, the area of land described in Schedule 1 of the said Order in Council was excluded from the Hutt Valley and Bays United Urban Fire District and included in the Eastbourne Urban Fire District:
    
    And whereas by an agreement dated 22 September 1966 (in this section referred to as the **agreement**), made between the Eastbourne Urban Fire Authority (in this section referred to as the **Authority**) and the Hutt Valley and Bays Fire Board (in this section referred to as the **Board**), it has been agreed that the Board will, within the said area of land described in Schedule 1 of the said Order in Council, exercise and perform all the rights, duties, and obligations conferred and imposed on the Authority by the Fire Services Act 1949:
    
    And whereas doubts have arisen as to the authority of the Authority and the Board to enter into the agreement and as to the validity of the agreement and it is desirable to validate the same:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    The Authority and the Board shall be deemed to have been authorised and empowered to enter into the agreement and the same is declared to have been lawfully made and shall have effect according to its tenor.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Local Legislation Act 1966\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 November 2010, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][61] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][62] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][63] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][64] and [17E][65] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
