##### 2 Validating certain rates struck by Opotiki County Council
    
*   Whereas the Opotiki County Council (hereinafter referred to as the said Council) made and levied for the year commencing on the first day of April, nineteen hundred and twenty-eight, and ending on the thirty-first day of March, nineteen hundred and twenty-nine, rates (hereinafter referred to as the said rates) in respect of the Upper Waioeka and Coast Ridings of the Opotiki County which were in excess of the limit prescribed by paragraph (b) of section ninety-two of the Rating Act 1925, and by the Counties Act 1920: And whereas on the first day of November, nineteen hundred and twenty-eight, the said Council made and delivered demands in writing for payment of the said rates, and the majority of the ratepayers in the said Ridings have, in pursuance of such demands, paid their rates for the said year ending on the thirty-first day of March, nineteen hundred and twenty-nine: And whereas it is advisable in the public interest and to prevent injustice to validate the said rates, and to empower the said Council to recover the balance still unpaid: Be it therefore enacted as follows:---
    
    (1) The said rates as appearing in the rate-book wherein the same were recorded shall be valid and be deemed to have been valid from the fifth day of October, nineteen hundred and twenty-eight, the date when the said Council purported to make and levy the same; the demands made by the said Council for payment of the said rates shall be and be deemed to have been valid, and the said rates shall be recoverable by the said Council, notwithstanding that the said rates were in excess of the limit prescribed by the aforesaid Acts, and notwithstanding the omission of any condition whatsoever precedent to the making or levying of the said rates, or any irregularity, mistake, or omission in the form or manner of making or levying the same or otherwise; and valid demands upon all persons liable for the said rates shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly made and delivered in accordance with law on the said first day of November, nineteen hundred and twenty-eight.
    
    (2) Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to take away the power of the said Council under subsection two of section fifty-seven of the Rating Act 1925, to correct errors (if any) existing in the said rate-book on the said fifth day of October, nineteen hundred and twenty-eight, which the said Council could or ought to have corrected.
    
    (3) The additional charge of ten per centum chargeable in respect of the said rates under the provisions of section seventy-six of the Rating Act 1925, may be added to all the said rates remaining unpaid at the expiration of six months and fourteen days from the passing of this Act, and not otherwise; and shall be payable and recoverable accordingly; but such additional charge of ten per centum shall not be recoverable until the said Council shall have publicly notified that the same will be added.
    
    (4) Judgment for the amount of any of the said rates due may be given or signed at any time within three years after the passing of this Act:
    
    Provided, however, that judgment for so much of the said rates as may be due in respect of Maori land may be given against any owner or occupier of that land at any time within four years after the passing of this Act.

    (1) The said deed and all the terms, conditions, and provisions therein contained are hereby validated, and shall be deemed to have been from the date of execution thereof good, valid, and effectual for all intents and purposes.
