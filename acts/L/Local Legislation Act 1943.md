    And whereas doubts have arisen as to the validity of the action of the Council in so doing:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    The action of the Council in granting the use and occupation of the said land and dwellinghouse free of rent and other outgoings as from 30 August 1941 is hereby validated, and the Council is hereby empowered to continue to allow any medical practitioner for the time being practising in the Town of Cheviot to use and occupy the said land and dwellinghouse free of rent and other outgoings until the expiration of 4 years from the termination of the present war or during such shorter period as the Council may think advisable.

    Notwithstanding anything contained in section 201 of the Counties Act 1920, or in any other Act, the action of the Eltham County Council in expending the said sum of 186 pounds and 1 penny is hereby validated, and the said moneys shall be deemed to have been lawfully expended.

    And whereas the Council has paid to the contractor such additional sum of 555 pounds:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    Notwithstanding that the sum so paid was computed at a rate in excess of the rates specified in the said contracts, the said payment is hereby validated and declared to have been lawfully made in all respects as if the same had been made pursuant to and at the rates specified in the schedules to the said contracts.

    And whereas it is desirable, for the purposes of considering and deciding whether the Council should or should not acquire the estate, interest, and rights of the company as aforesaid, that such of the members of the Council as are not shareholders of the company should be deemed to constitute a quorum:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
