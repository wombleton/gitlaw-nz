    (2) The reference to an antevesting date in any certificate of title purporting to be issued in pursuance of any such warrant shall be conclusive evidence of that date, and that the same was fixed by the Governor-General's warrant, as in the certificate is set forth and stated.
    
    (3) This section shall not be construed to validate or enable the registration under the Land Transfer Acts of any instrument executed before 16 September 1889 (being the date of the commencement of the Land Transfer Act 1885 Amendment Act 1889), by any Maori owner, so far as the instrument was not valid or capable of registration before that date.

    (2) Every such reservation, and all rights existing by virtue thereof, shall be deemed sufficiently protected by the general reservation in any certificate of title of the right of the Crown to take and lay off roads under the provisions of any Act of the Parliament of New Zealand, and no certificate of title shall be impeached on the ground of uncertainty or otherwise on account of any such reservation therein contained.

    *   (a) no registered proprietor of the fee simple estate in the access strip may dispose of or create any charge over any allotment of the subdivision that is contiguous to the access strip to or in favour of any person, unless he simultaneously in like manner and to or in favour of the same person disposes of or creates a charge over his share in the access strip, or, as the case may be, in so much thereof as is attributable under subsection (1) of [section 89A][106] to his ownership of the contiguous allotment being so disposed of or over which he is creating a charge as aforesaid. For the purposes of this paragraph, the settlement of any such allotment as a joint family home under the provisions of the [Joint Family Homes Act 1964][404] shall be deemed not to be a disposal of the allotment:
    
    *   (b) the Registrar shall make an entry upon the certificate of title so issued for the access strip, and on the register copy of the certificate of title for the fee simple estate in every allotment of the subdivision that is contiguous thereto and the registered proprietor of which is the registered proprietor or one of the registered proprietors named in the certificate of title so issued as aforesaid, to the effect that the contiguous land is subject to the provisions of paragraph (a):
    
    *   (c) where any other certificate of title under this Act is in existence for the fee simple estate in the access strip, the Registrar shall cancel that other certificate of title so far as it relates to the access strip, and the memorial of cancellation shall state that the cancellation is made under the authority of this section:
    
    *   (d) any fee simple estate in the access strip previously held by any person other than the persons named in the certificate of title so issued as being seised of that estate in fee simple shall cease and determine:
    
    *   (e) where any allotment of the subdivision to which any share in the access strip is attributable under subsection (1) of [section 89A][106] is owned in fee simple by 2 or more persons as joint tenants or as tenants in common, that share shall also vest in them as joint tenants or, as the case may be, as tenants in common in the shares in which that allotment is vested in them:
    
    *   (f) where any allotment of the subdivision contiguous to the access strip is at the time of the issue of the certificate of title subject to a registered mortgage, and the mortgagor thereunder is registered as the proprietor or one of the proprietors of an estate in fee simple in the access strip by virtue of his ownership of that allotment, any power expressed or implied in the mortgage whereby the mortgagee may sell the allotment or any part thereof on default being made under the provisions of the mortgage shall be deemed to extend to and include power to sell so much of the mortgagor's estate or interest in the access strip as is attributable to his ownership of the allotment (or, as the case may be, a proportionate part thereof where the power of sale relates to part only of the allotment), as if that estate or interest were included in the mortgage as part of the security; and the Registrar shall make an entry on the register copy of the mortgage, and also on the mortgagee's copy when it is produced to him, to the effect that this paragraph applies to the mortgage:
    
    *   (g) where any allotment to which paragraph (f) applies is, after the issue of the certificate of title, settled as a joint family home under the [Joint Family Homes Act 1964][404], the provisions of that paragraph shall apply whether the share in the access strip is owned by the husband and wife or by either of them:
    
    *   (h) for the purposes of paragraph (f), the term _mortgage_ includes any lien, charge, or other security for the payment of money; and the terms _mortgagor_ and _mortgagee_ have corresponding meanings; and the provisions of that paragraph, as far as they are applicable and with any necessary modifications, shall apply with respect to such liens, charges, or securities accordingly:
    
    *   (i) notwithstanding anything in [section 172][253], no action shall lie against the Crown or the Registrar-General by any person whose estate in fee simple in the land in the certificate of title so issued has ceased or been determined under paragraph (d) by reason of that cessation or determination, except where that registered proprietor---
            
        *   (i) has been deprived of that estate by fraud on the part of any applicant or applicants under any application under this Part or by the error, omission, or misfeasance of the Registrar or any of his officers or clerks in dealing with any application; and
        
        *   (ii) is by this Act barred from bringing an action for possession or other action for recovery of the land or the said estate therein.

#### Provisions applicable where outstanding duplicates of instruments extant

##### 4 Provisions applicable in cases where outstanding duplicates have not been destroyed
    
*   (1) The provisions of this section shall apply only in cases where certificates of title or other instruments that were registered in the old register or duplicates of instruments that were embodied in the old register have not been destroyed.
    
    (2) In any case to which this section applies, the Registrar may cause copies of such instruments or duplicates as aforesaid to be prepared. Such copies shall, upon being duly authenticated under the hand and seal of the Registrar, and subject to the provisions of this Act, have the same force and effect as the corresponding folios of the old register, or the corresponding original instruments, as the case may be.
    
    (3) In the case of certificates of title, the Registrar, in lieu of making and authenticating copies as provided for in the last preceding subsection, may issue new certificates of title which shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, have the same force and effect as if they were certificates of title issued under the provisions of the principal Act. Every such certificate shall have endorsed thereon a memorandum to the effect that it is issued in lieu of a certificate of title the register copy of which has been destroyed.
    
    (4) In any case where an instrument was executed in triplicate, and whether or not a triplicate was presented for registration, if 2 copies of such instrument have been destroyed, the provisions of subsection (2) shall apply with respect to the remaining triplicate if the Registrar is satisfied that the same is a true triplicate of such instrument. Unless and until the Registrar endorses thereon a memorandum to the effect that it is conclusive, no such remaining triplicate or duplicate copy adopted in accordance with the next succeeding subsection shall be conclusive as to any memorials that may have been endorsed upon the triplicate that was retained by the Registrar, and the Registrar shall endorse upon it a memorandum that it is not conclusive as to such memorials (if any). Subject to the foregoing provisions of this subsection, every such remaining triplicate or adopted duplicate shall for the purposes of this section be regarded as if it were the registered triplicate upon which memorials were or may have been endorsed by the Registrar.
    
    (5) On the adoption of any triplicate of any registered instrument it shall be lawful for the Registrar to receive with the adopted triplicate 2 copies thereof, and to certify one of such copies free of cost, and to issue the same in substitution for the outstanding duplicate of the instrument upon which memorials are to be endorsed under section 40 of the principal Act, and thereafter such copy shall have the same force and effect as if it were the original duplicate upon which memorials may be endorsed by the Registrar.
    
    Section 4(4): amended, on 22 December 1933, by [section 8(a)][505] of the Land Transfer (Hawke's Bay) Amendment Act 1933 (1933 No 39).

*   (1) Except as provided in subsection (3), no certificate of title issued under the last preceding section, or issued in substitution for any such certificate of title, or issued in respect of any part of the land comprised in any such certificate of title, and no copy of any instrument authenticated under that section, shall, until the expiration of 1 year from the date of the issue of such certificate of title, or from the date of the issue of the first such certificate where more than 1 certificate of title has been issued, or from the date of the Registrar's authentication of such copy, as the case may be, or until the expiration of 1 year from the date of the passing of this Act, whichever period is the later to expire, be conclusive as to the proprietorship of any mortgage, lease, easement, or _profit Ã  prendre_, or as to the non-existence on 3 February 1931 of---

Such application shall have endorsed thereon or shall be accompanied by a plan of the land of which the applicant claims to have been the registered proprietor or mortgagee, and shall include a statement of the registered encumbrances, liens, and interests, statutory and other charges, restrictions, and caveats to which, within the knowledge or belief of the applicant, the land was subject; and the statements contained in such application shall be verified by the statutory declaration of the applicant. The plan shall be as full and accurate as the circumstances of each case will permit without the making of a new survey of the land.
    
    (2) The Registrar, if he is satisfied, after the making of such inquiries and the sending of such notices, if any, as he may deem necessary or advisable, that the certificate of title was destroyed, and that the applicant was the registered proprietor or a mortgagee as aforesaid, may issue a new certificate of title for the land the subject of the application.

##### 7 Memorandum of interests admitted by proprietor or mortgagee
    
*   (1) The Registrar shall endorse on every such new certificate of title a memorandum setting forth the encumbrances, liens, and interests, statutory and other charges, restrictions, and caveats to which the land appears to him to be subject.
    
    (2) In any case in which it seems to him proper so to do, the Registrar may at any time cancel any such memorandum, or he may add to or amend the statements contained in any such memorandum, by a further memorandum:
    
    provided that in any case where by any such addition or amendment it is shown that any interest in the land is subject to any further encumbrance, lien, interest, charge, restriction, or caveat, the Registrar shall forthwith send by registered letter to every registered proprietor adversely affected by such addition or amendment a notice that such addition or amendment has been made.
    
    (3) Every such memorandum shall be prima facie proof of the existence of the estates or interests or of the matters referred to in it.

##### 8 Where outstanding copy of certificate of title destroyed Registrar may issue new one
    
*   The Registrar, in any case where he knows or believes that the certificate of title for any land was destroyed, may, if it seems to him proper so to do, of his own motion or at the instance of any person claiming an estate or interest in the land, issue a new certificate of title for such land. The provisions of the last preceding section shall, with the necessary modifications, apply to every such certificate of title.

    (3) Any certificate of title issued in substitution for an interim certificate of title or issued for any part of the land comprised in an interim certificate shall be an interim certificate, with respect to which the provisions of the last preceding subsection shall apply.

##### 11 Application to make interim certificate conclusive
    
*   (1) The registered proprietor, or a mortgagee, of land comprised in an interim certificate of title may at any time make application in writing to the Registrar, to endorse upon such certificate a memorandum that it is conclusive. Such application shall be accompanied by such evidence as may be necessary to establish, without reasonable doubt, the ownership of the land comprised in the certificate of title, and the encumbrances, liens, interests, charges, and restrictions (if any) to which the land is subject.
    
    (2) Upon receipt of any such application the Registrar shall consider the evidence submitted in support thereof, and may require the production of further evidence in support thereof.
    
    (3) If the Registrar is satisfied with any such evidence or further evidence, he shall endorse upon the interim certificate of title a memorandum as provided for by the last preceding section.
    
    (4) If the Registrar is not satisfied with such evidence or further evidence, he may, at the expense of the applicant, publish notice of the application once in the _Gazette_ and twice at an interval of not less than 2 weeks in some newspaper or newspapers published and circulating in the district. Such notice shall limit and appoint a time, not less than the prescribed period, within which any person claiming to have been the registered proprietor of, or claiming to be entitled to the benefit of any encumbrance, lien, or interest upon or in, the land may present for registration an appropriate instrument, in the same manner as if the old register had not been destroyed, for the purpose of re-evidencing such encumbrance, lien, or interest, or may lodge a caveat in the form required by section 137 of the principal Act to protect the same, whether such encumbrance, lien, or interest was registered in the old register or not.
    
    (5) After the expiration of the time limited in any such notice, the Registrar shall, unless in his opinion there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary, endorse upon the interim certificate of title for the land referred to in such notice a memorandum to the effect that it is conclusive, or that it is conclusive except as to the description and delineation of the land comprised therein, as to him shall seem proper in the circumstances, and the certificate of title shall thereupon be conclusive according to the tenor of such memorandum; but subject, nevertheless, to the rights, if any, of any person who shall theretofore have lodged a caveat.
    
    (6) The Registrar may at any time thereafter, if he is reasonably satisfied that the interim certificate correctly sets forth the description and delineation of the land comprised therein, endorse a further memorandum to the effect that such certificate of title is conclusive as to the description and delineation of the land, and the certificate shall thereupon be conclusive according to the tenor of such memorandum.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Land Transfer Act 1952\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 January 2011, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][522] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][523] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][524] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][525] and [17E][526] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   â¢omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   â¢typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   â¢layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   â¢indentation
        *   â¢position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   â¢format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   â¢format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   â¢position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   â¢punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   â¢Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   â¢case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   â¢format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   â¢small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   â¢schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   â¢running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   â¢format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
