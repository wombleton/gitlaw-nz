*   Whereas the Local Government Commission, pursuant to section 21 of the Local Government Commission Act 1953, has promulgated a final scheme dated 18 July 1955 providing for the inclusion of the area described in the Schedule of the said final scheme which comprises the whole of the Borough of Upper Hutt and a certain part of the County of Hutt in the Hutt River District (in this section referred to as the **River District**):
    
    And whereas, in order to enable full effect to be given to the said final scheme, it is expedient that provision be made in accordance with this section:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    (1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Act, the Governor-General may in the Order in Council giving effect to the said final scheme or in a subsequent Order in Council, declare:
        
    *   (a) that, on the addition of the area referred to in the said final scheme to the River District, the said area shall form a new subdivision of the River District to be known as the Upper Hutt Subdivision; and
    
    *   (b) that, on the addition of the Upper Hutt Subdivision to the River District, the Hutt River Board shall be increased to 9 members of whom 2 shall represent the Petone Subdivision, 5 shall represent the Lower Hutt Subdivision, and 2 shall represent the Upper Hutt Subdivision.
    
    (2) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the [River Boards Act 1908][53] or the Local Elections and Polls Act 1953, on the addition of the Upper Hutt Subdivision to the River District, the Upper Hutt Borough Council and the Hutt County Council shall by resolution each appoint 1 person, being a person qualified to be elected as a representative of the Upper Hutt Subdivision, to represent that Subdivision on the Hutt River Board, and the persons so appointed shall hold office until the members elected at the next general election of members of that Board come into office.
    
    (3) The members of the Hutt River Board representing the Petone and Lower Hutt Subdivisions at the date of the addition of the Upper Hutt Subdivision to the River District shall, unless they sooner vacate their offices, continue to hold office until the members elected at the next general election of members of the Hutt River Board come into office.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Local Legislation Act 1955\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 July 2003, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][58] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][59] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][60] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][61] and [17E][62] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   â¢omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   â¢typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   â¢layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   â¢indentation
        *   â¢position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   â¢format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   â¢format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   â¢position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   â¢punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   â¢Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   â¢case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   â¢format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   â¢small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   â¢schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   â¢running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   â¢format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
