    Compare: 1989 No 142 [s 17C][135]; Reprints Act 1992 s 8 (Qld)

##### 25 Editorial changes
    
*   (1) The Chief Parliamentary Counsel may make the following changes in a reprint:
        
    *   (a) language that indicates or could be taken to indicate a particular gender may be changed to gender-neutral language so that it is consistent with current drafting practice, as long as it is also consistent with the purpose of the legislation being reprinted:
        
        ###### Examples
        
        The word ""he"" may be changed to ""he or she"", or replaced with the relevant noun.
        
        The word ""chairman"" may be changed to ""chairperson"".
        
        The words ""Her Majesty the Queen"" may be changed to ""the Sovereign"".
    
    *   (b) the numbering, renumbering, and consequential amendments authorised by an Order in Council made under subsection (2):
    
    *   (c) a reference to the name or title of a body, an office, a person, a place, or a thing that has been changed may be replaced with a reference to the name or title as changed:
    
    *   (d) a reference to a body, office, person, place, or thing that has been replaced by another body, office, person, place, or thing may be changed to a reference to the replacement body, office, person, place, or thing:
    
    *   (e) changes may be made to the way provisions are referred to, so as to be consistent with current drafting practice:
        
        ###### Example
        
        ""Schedule 1 to the Ombudsmen Act 1975"" may be changed to ""Schedule 1 of the Ombudsmen Act 1975"".
    
    *   (f) unnecessary referential words may be omitted:

    *   (h) punctuation may be changed or omitted, or new punctuation inserted, so as to be consistent with current drafting practice:
    
    *   (i) conjunctives and disjunctives may be inserted, omitted, or changed so as to be consistent with current drafting practice:
    
    *   (j) obvious errors of the following kinds may be corrected:
            
        *   (i) typographical and clerical errors:
        
        *   (ii) grammatical and spelling errors, and errors of punctuation:

        *   (v) any other errors of a similar nature:

            In the following provision, the word in bold can be omitted: ""The board of a company may make offers on **on** one or more stock exchanges"".
            
            An Act consequentially repeals section 85(3) of another Act. The other Act does not contain a section 85, and it is obvious from the context that the intention was to repeal section 75(3). The error can be corrected.
            
            An Act contains amendments to section 6 of another Act. Before the first Act comes into force, the other Act is amended so that section 6 is replaced by section 6A in substantially similar terms. Section 6A can be amended to reflect the intent of the amendments to section 6\.
        
        
    
    *   (k) changes may be made to the way numbers, dates, times, quantities, measurements, and similar matters, ideas, or concepts are referred to or expressed so as to be consistent with current drafting practice:
        
        ###### Example
        
        A reference in a form to ""this \[blank\] day of \[blank\] 19..."" may be changed to ""\[_Date_\]"".
    
    *   (l) a provision in the nature of a savings, transitional, validation, or other similar provision that is contained in an amending enactment may be incorporated as a provision of the enactment it amends, and all necessary consequential amendments may be made:
    
    *   (m) changes may be made to show the effect of any amendment or repeal, and changes may be made that are purely consequential on any amendment made, by another enactment, to the legislation reprinted:
        
        ###### Example
        
        The heading to a section may be changed to reflect the effect of an amendment to the section.
    
    *   (n) changes may be made that are purely consequential on any other change authorised by this subpart.
    
    (2) For the purpose of making legislation consistent with current drafting practice, the Governor-General may, by Order in Council, authorise the Chief Parliamentary Counsel to---
        
    *   (a) reprint any specified legislation by numbering provisions or renumbering provisions, as the case may be, in the manner indicated by the order; and
    
    *   (b) reprint any other specified legislation, in the manner indicated by the order, so as to update any references in that legislation to provisions that are numbered or renumbered under paragraph (a).
    
    (3) Alternative text that is inserted in a reprint to indicate the effect of an element (for example, a graphical image such as a crest, map, or medal) does not form part of an official version of the reprinted enactment.

    *   (d) the addition or removal of boldface, italics, and similar textual attributes:
    
    *   (e) the addition or removal of quotation marks and rules:
    
    *   (f) changes to the case of letters or words:
        
        ###### Example
        
        Small capitals may be changed to ordinary capitals or to lower case.
    
    *   (g) the repositioning of the date of Royal assent.
    
    Compare: 1989 No 142 [s 17D][137]
