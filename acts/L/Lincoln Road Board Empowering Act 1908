An Act to enable the Lincoln Road Board to close a Road and to make and open a New Road.
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    WHEREAS the parcels of land described in Schedule [1][8] hereto were originally reserved and laid off for the purposes of a public road along the northern bank of the River Halswell, but such road is not required, and the convenience of the public would be consulted if the said road was closed and a new public road obtained and made over the parcels of land described in Schedule [2][9] hereto: And whereas it is doubtful whether, in the absence of direct parliamentary authority, the Lincoln Road Board, being the local authority having jurisdiction over the said road so reserved and laid off, has authority to close the said road and dispose of the land forming the same: And whereas it is desirable that power should be given to the Lincoln Road Board to close the said first-mentioned road and to construct a new road in place and stead thereof, and to do all things necessary for acquiring the land necessary for such new road and transferring the land forming the existing and first-mentioned road to the persons owning land fronting thereon:

BE IT THEREFORE ENACTED by the General Assembly of New Zealand in Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:---

*   If and when a new road one chain wide over any of the lands described in Schedule [2][9] hereto, or in the vicinity thereof, has been dedicated to the use of the public for the purposes of a public road, and has been opened to the public for use as a public road, then and immediately thereon the parcels of land described in Schedule [1][8] hereto shall cease to be a public road and shall vest in the Lincoln Road Board for an estate of fee-simple and inheritance in possession free from incumbrances, and the said Board may sell and transfer the same to the owner or owners of land fronting thereon, to each several such owner so much of the said land as has heretofore formed the road along and in front of his holding:
    
    Provided that every such sale shall be subject to a right of way on foot for the public over and along the land sold.

##### 3 Any land described in Schedule [1][8] conveyed or transferred to any frontager thereon to be held subject to the same charges (if any) as land fronting thereon is subject
