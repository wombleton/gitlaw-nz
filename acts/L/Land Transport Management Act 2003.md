    (2) If a regional transport committee decides not to include in its regional land transport plan an activity or combination of activities proposed by an approved organisation or the Agency, the regional transport committee must, at the same time as it lodges the plan with the regional council under subsection (1), give the approved organisation or the Agency (as the case may require) written advice of the decision and the reasons for the decision.
