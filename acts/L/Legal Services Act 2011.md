##### 8 When legal aid may be granted: criminal matters
    
*   (1) The Commissioner may grant legal aid to an applicant in respect of proceedings to which [section 6][9] applies (criminal matters) if---
        
    *   (a) the applicant is a natural person charged with or convicted of an offence; and
    
    *   (b) it appears to the Commissioner that the applicant does not have sufficient means to enable him or her to obtain legal assistance; and
    
    *   (c) either---
            
        *   (i) the offence to which the application relates is punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of 6 months or more; or
        
        *   (ii) it appears to the Commissioner that the interests of justice require that the applicant be granted legal aid.
        
        
    
    (2) When considering whether the interests of justice require that the applicant be granted legal aid, the Commissioner---
        
    *   (a) must have regard to---
            
        *   (i) whether the applicant has any previous conviction; and
        
        *   (ii) whether the applicant is charged with or convicted of an offence punishable by imprisonment; and
        
        *   (iii) whether there is a real likelihood that the applicant, if convicted, will be sentenced to imprisonment; and

    *   (b) may have regard to any other circumstances that, in the opinion of the Commissioner, are relevant.
    
    (3) When determining whether an applicant has sufficient means to enable him or her to obtain legal assistance, the Commissioner must, except as provided under [section 9(1)][12], have regard to the applicant's income and disposable capital as set out in [Schedule 1][212].
    
    (4) Subsection (1)(c)(i) does not apply in respect of---
        
    *   (a) an appeal; or

##### 9 Prescribed offences
    
*   (1) If an applicant is charged with or convicted of a prescribed offence, the Commissioner must determine, in the manner set out in regulations, whether the applicant has sufficient means to enable him or her to obtain legal assistance unless subsection (2) applies.
    
    (2) However, the Commissioner must determine or, if the case requires, redetermine the applicant's means in accordance with [section 8(3)][11] if---
        
    *   (a) the Commissioner considers it possible that the cost of services for the grant may exceed the prescribed maximum grant:

    *   (c) the Commissioner considers that the cost of services exceeds the prescribed maximum grant:

    *   (e) the application for the grant of legal aid is in respect of an appeal:
    
    *   (f) any circumstances prescribed in regulations apply.
    
    (3) In this section, _prescribed maximum grant_ means the maximum amount of legal aid prescribed in regulations that may be granted for a prescribed offence.

*   (1) The Commissioner must, subject to this section and [sections 11 to 13][14], grant legal aid to an applicant in respect of proceedings to which [section 7][10] applies (civil matters) if the applicant is---

    *   (b) the applicant's ability to fund the proceedings if legal aid is not granted.
    
    (2A) However, in the case of an application that comes within any of paragraphs (b) to (d) and (f) to (h) of the definition of specified application in [section 4(1)][5], it is sufficient, for the purposes of subsection (2), if the Commissioner has regard to either paragraph (a) or (b) of that subsection.
    
    (3) The Commissioner must refuse to grant legal aid if the applicant has not shown that the applicant has reasonable grounds for taking or defending the proceedings or being a party to the proceedings.
    
    (3A) The Commissioner may, unless the interests of justice require otherwise, refuse to grant legal aid to an applicant if---
        
    *   (a) any amount payable by the applicant in respect of a repayment of a previous grant of legal aid is in arrears; and
    
    *   (b) the application made by the applicant does not come within any of paragraphs (b) to (d) and (f) to (h) of the definition of specified application in [section 4(1)][5].
    
    (4) The Commissioner may refuse to grant legal aid to an applicant in any of the following circumstances:
        
    *   (a) the Commissioner is unable to obtain full information concerning the applicant's financial affairs because of the default or failure of the applicant:

    *   (c) the applicant is not resident in New Zealand and the Commissioner considers that the proceedings might reasonably be brought in a jurisdiction other than New Zealand:
    
    *   (d) in the case of original proceedings,---
            
        *   (i) the applicant's prospects of success are not sufficient to justify the grant of legal aid; or
        
        *   (ii) the grant of legal aid is not justified, having regard to the nature of the proceedings and the applicant's interest in them (financial or otherwise), in relation to the likely cost of the proceedings; or
        
        *   (iii) for any other cause where it appears unreasonable or undesirable that the applicant should receive legal aid in the particular circumstances of the case:
        
        
    
    *   (e) in the case of an appeal (whether or not in respect of proceedings in which the applicant has received legal aid), the Commissioner considers that for any reason the grant of legal aid or further legal aid is not justified.
    
    (5) The Commissioner may refuse to grant legal aid to an applicant in respect of any original proceeding under an enactment specified in [Schedule 2][213] if the Commissioner considers that the grant of legal aid is not justified.
    
    (6) In determining under subsection (5) whether a grant of legal aid is not justified, the Commissioner must have regard to---
        
    *   (a) any previous proceedings in the matter to which the application relates; and
    
    *   (b) any personal protection issues such as (without limitation) any orders relating to domestic violence, protection of personal property rights, compulsory treatment, or compulsory care; and
    
    *   (c) \[Repealed\]
    
    *   (d) whether there are any complex factual, legal, or evidential matters that require the determination of a court; and
    
    *   (e) whether it is in the public interest that legal aid be granted.
