##### 2 Interpretation
    
*   In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,---
    
    _court_ means a court having jurisdiction in the proceedings by virtue of [section 5][6]
    
    _promise_ includes any statement or representation of fact or intention.
    
    Section 2: replaced, on 1 July 1992, by section 2 of the Law Reform (Testamentary Promises) Amendment Act 1991 (1991 No 64).

##### 3 Estate of deceased person liable to remunerate persons for work done under promise of testamentary provision
    
*   (1) Where in the administration of the estate of any deceased person a claim is made against the estate founded upon the rendering of services to or the performance of work for the deceased in his lifetime, and the claimant proves an express or implied promise by the deceased to reward him for the services or work by making some testamentary provision for the claimant, whether or not the provision was to be of a specified amount or was to relate to specified real or personal property, then, subject to the provisions of this Act, the claim shall, to the extent to which the deceased has failed to make that testamentary provision or otherwise remunerate the claimant (whether or not a claim for such remuneration could have been enforced in the lifetime of the deceased), be enforceable against the personal representatives of the deceased in the same manner and to the same extent as if the promise of the deceased were a promise for payment by the deceased in his lifetime of such amount as may be reasonable, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including in particular the circumstances in which the promise was made and the services were rendered or the work was performed, the value of the services or work, the value of the testamentary provision promised, the amount of the estate, and the nature and amounts of the claims of other persons in respect of the estate, whether as creditors, beneficiaries, wife, husband, civil union partner, children, next-of-kin, or otherwise.
    
    (2) This section shall apply---
        
    *   (a) whether the services were rendered or the work was performed before or after the making of the promise:
    
    *   (b) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in [subpart 2][10] of Part 2 of the Property Law Act 2007 or any other enactment.
    
    (3) Where the promise relates to any real or personal property which forms part of the estate of the deceased on his death, the court may in its discretion, instead of awarding to the claimant a reasonable sum as aforesaid,---
        
    *   (a) make an order vesting the property in the claimant or directing any person to transfer or assign the property to him; or
    
    *   (b) make an order vesting any part of the property in the claimant or directing any person to transfer or assign any part of the property to him, and awarding to the claimant such amount (if any) as in its opinion is reasonable in the circumstances.
    
    (4) In awarding any amount on a claim under this section the court may, if it thinks fit, order that the amount awarded may consist of a lump sum or a periodical or other payment.
    
    (5) The incidence of any payment or payments so ordered shall, unless the court otherwise determines, fall rateably upon the whole estate of the deceased, or, in cases where the authority of the court does not extend or cannot directly or indirectly be made to extend to the whole estate, then to so much thereof as is situated in New Zealand.
    
    (6) The court shall have power, after hearing such of the parties as may be affected as it thinks necessary, to exonerate any part of the estate of the deceased from the incidence of any such payment or payments, to determine priorities as between any benefit awarded by the court to the claimant under this Act and the beneficial interests of any other person or persons in the estate of the deceased person, and to make such provision as it thinks fit as to the incidence of the whole or any part of the debts, testamentary expenses, and duty in respect of the estate of the deceased. For the purposes of this subsection the court may direct any executor or administrator to represent, or appoint any person to represent, any such party.
    
    (7) Any order under this section, or any provision of any such order, may be made upon and subject to such terms and conditions as the court thinks fit.
    
    (8) Nothing in this section shall affect any remedy which a claimant may have apart from this Act in respect of any promise to which this section relates, and where a claimant has any such remedy he may at his option enforce that remedy or his remedy under this section, but not both:
    
    provided that nothing in this section shall prevent alternative claims in respect of those remedies from being made in the one action.
    
    (9) Subsection (3) is subject to [section 10(3) to (5)][11] of the Succession (Homicide) Act 2007\.

    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][26] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][27] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][28] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][29] and [17E][30] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
