An Act to constitute as a Public Domain certain land held by the Corporation of the Borough of Levin under the will of Henry Playford, to confer certain powers on the Corporation in connection therewith, and to vary accordingly the trusts created by that will
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    Whereas Henry Playford, of Levin, farmer, died at Levin on 24 May 1936:
    
    And whereas the said Henry Playford left a last will and testament bearing date 22 July 1930:
    
    And whereas probate of the said will was on 25 June 1936 granted by the Supreme Court of New Zealand at Wellington to the Public Trustee of the Dominion of New Zealand, the executor and trustee appointed by the said will:
    
    And whereas by paragraph 3 of the said will the testator devised to the Mayor, Councillors, and Burgesses of the Borough of Levin the land particularly described in [Schedule 1][18] in the following terms---namely, ""upon trust for all time as a motorists' camping-ground for the use of the public free of charge except as to such facilities or conveniences as the said Corporation may install or supply, but otherwise subject to such regulations, conditions, and restrictions as the Levin Borough Council may from time to time prescribe and should the said Corporation not accept the foregoing gift within a period of twelve calendar months after notification thereof shall have been given to the said Borough Council by my Trustee or should the said land at any time after the said Corporation shall have accepted the foregoing gift for any cause cease to be used or available for the purposes and upon the conditions aforesaid for a consecutive period of twelve calendar months then I give devise and bequeath all my said estate and interest in the said piece of land to the Palmerston North Hospital Board for the benefit of the Palmerston North Public Hospital"":
    
    And whereas by paragraph 4 of the said will the testator devised and bequeathed the residue of his estate, including the land described in [Schedule 2][19], after payment of his just debts, funeral and testamentary expenses, and all estate and succession duty payable in respect of his estate, upon trusts expressed as follows:
        
    *   "(a) During such time as the said piece of land" (being that described in [Schedule 1][18]) "shall be held by the said Corporation upon and subject to the trusts in regard thereto set forth in the last preceding paragraph three hereof to pay the income arising therefrom to the said Corporation to be applied in and towards the upkeep maintenance and improvement of the said camping-ground and in and towards payment of any outgoings and charges in connection therewith in such manner in all respects as the Levin Borough Council shall think fit:
    
    *   "(b) Subject to the foregoing provisions hereof upon trust for the Palmerston North Hospital Board for the benefit of the Palmerston North Public Hospital":
    
    And whereas the said Corporation has established and maintained as a motorists' camping ground the land described in the said [Schedule 1][18] in terms of the said will:
    
    And whereas it is desirable that the said land should be made available for the use of the public as a recreation ground, sports ground, and gardens, as well as a motorists' camping ground, freed and discharged from the trusts created by the said will:
    
    And whereas the said land can be more efficiently administered for the aforesaid purposes as a public domain:
    
    And whereas the annual income derived from the said residuary estate is inadequate for the purpose of developing, improving, and maintaining that land for the aforesaid purposes to a standard in keeping with modern requirements:
    
    And whereas it is desirable that the capital as well as the income of the said residuary estate should be made available for the aforesaid purposes, and accordingly that the said residuary estate should be freed from the trusts attaching thereto and vested in the Corporation, with power for the Corporation to convert it into money and expend the net proceeds of such conversion in and towards the management, administration, and improvement of the said land for such purposes as aforesaid:
    
    And whereas the Public Trustee and the Palmerston North Hospital Board have consented to the above-mentioned variations being made to the terms of the trust created by the will of the testator:
    
    And whereas the objects of this Act are not obtainable otherwise than by legislation.

    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][20] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][21] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][22] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][23] and [17E][24] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
