##### 3 Purpose
    
*   The purpose of this Act is to modernise the law governing the conduct of local elections and polls and, in doing this, to---
        
    *   (a) provide sufficient flexibility in the law to readily accommodate new technologies and processes as they are developed (through the use of regulations to prescribe matters of detail that will be the subject of future change); and
    
    *   (b) adopt uniform rules in relation to---
            
        *   (i) the timing of local elections; and
        
        *   (ii) the right of individuals to vote, stand for election, and nominate candidates for election; and
        
        *   (iii) the appointment, powers, and duties of electoral officers and other electoral officials; and
        
        *   (iv) the compilation of electoral rolls; and
        
        *   (v) the procedures to be adopted for the conduct of elections and polls; and
        
        *   (vi) offences against this Act and penalties for those offences; and
        
        *   (vii) disputed elections; and
        
        *   (viii) electoral expenses; and
        
        *   (ix) extraordinary vacancies; and
        
        
    
    *   (c) allow diversity (through local decision-making) in relation to---
            
        *   (i) the particular electoral system to be used for local elections and polls; and
        
        *   (ia) the regular review of representation arrangements for local authorities; and
        
        *   (ii) the particular voting method to be used for local elections and polls; and
        
        
    
    *   (d) implement the principles set out in [section 4][4].
    
    Section 3(c)(ia): inserted, on 25 December 2002, by [section 3][284] of the Local Electoral Amendment Act 2002 (2002 No 85).

        *   (i) all of the proposed members of the territorial authority (other than the mayor) are to be separately elected by the electors of 1 or more Māori wards and the electors of 1 or more general wards; or

##### 2 Calculation of number of Māori and general ward members
    
*   (1) The number of members to be elected by the electors of 1 or more Māori wards of the district of a territorial authority (_Māori ward members_) is to be determined in accordance with the following formula:
    
    ![. ](images/ACT_NZL_PUB.2002_085_BDY_S.55_GPH.9_V1.jpg)
    
    where---
        
    *   nmm is the number of Māori ward members
    
    *   mepd is the Māori electoral population of the district
    
    *   gepd is the general electoral population of the district
    
    *   nm is the proposed number of members of the territorial authority (other than the mayor).
    
    (2) If a determination is made under [clause 1(2)(b)(ii)][466], the definition of nm in the formula must be applied as if for the words ""proposed number of members of the territorial authority (other than the mayor)"" there were substituted the words ""proposed number of members of the territorial authority (other than the mayor and the members to be elected by electors of the district as a whole)"".
    
    (3) If the number of the Māori ward members (other than the mayor) calculated under subclause (1) includes a fraction, the fraction must be disregarded unless it exceeds a half. If the fraction exceeds a half, the number of Māori ward members must be the next whole number above the number that includes the fraction.
    
    (4) The number of members to be elected by the electors of 1 or more general wards is to be determined by subtracting from the proposed number of members of the territorial authority (other than the mayor, or, if the case requires, other than the mayor and the members of the territorial authority to be elected by electors of the district as a whole) the number of Māori ward members, as calculated under subclauses (1) and (3).
    
    (5) Despite [Part 1A][28] and the provisions of this schedule, if the number of Māori ward members, as determined in accordance with the method of calculation in this clause, is zero (because the number of Māori ward members as so determined is a fraction of the whole number 1 that does not exceed one half),---
        
    *   (a) the district must not be divided into 1 or more Māori wards and 1 or more general wards:
    
    *   (b) the provisions of [clauses 1][466], [5][467], and [6][468] of this schedule must not be applied for the purposes of any determination under [section 19H][36] or [section 19R][48].
    
    Compare: 2001 No 1 (L) [s 6][469]

##### 3 Review of representation arrangements for election of regional council
    
*   (1) If, for the purposes of a triennial general election, a region of a regional council (being a region that is not already divided into 1 or more Māori constituencies) is required to be divided into 1 or more Māori constituencies, the regional council must, in the year immediately before the year in which the triennial general election is to be held, but not later than 31 August in the year immediately before the year in which the triennial general election is to be held, make a determination under [section 19I][37].
    
    (2) That determination must be made as if the regional council were required by [section 19I][37] to determine by resolution, in accordance with [Part 1A][28],---
        
    *   (a) the proposed number of members of the regional council; and
    
    *   (b) the proposed number of members of the regional council to be elected by the electors of 1 or more Māori constituencies; and
    
    *   (c) the proposed number of members of the regional council to be elected by electors of 1 or more general constituencies; and
    
    *   (d) the proposed name and the proposed boundaries of each constituency; and
    
    *   (e) the number of members proposed to be elected by the electors of each Māori constituency; and
    
    *   (f) the number of members proposed to be elected by the electors of each general constituency.

##### 4 Calculation of number of Māori and general constituency members
    
*   (1) The number of members to be elected by the electors of 1 or more Māori constituencies of a regional council (_Māori constituency members_) is to be determined in accordance with the following formula:
    
    ![. ](images/ACT_NZL_PUB.2002_085_BDY_S.55_GPH.10_V1.jpg)
    
    where---

    *   mepr is the Māori electoral population of the region
    
    *   gepr is the general electoral population of the region
    
    *   nm is the proposed number of members of the regional council.
    
    (2) If the number of the Māori constituency members calculated under subclause (1) includes a fraction, the fraction must be disregarded unless it exceeds a half. If the fraction exceeds a half, the number of Māori constituency members must be the next whole number above the number that includes the fraction.
    
    (3) The number of members to be elected by the electors of 1 or more general constituencies is to be determined by subtracting from the proposed number of members of the regional council the number of Māori constituency members, as calculated under subclauses (1) and (2).
    
    (4) Despite [Part 1A][28] and the provisions of this schedule, if the number of Māori constituency members, as determined in accordance with the method of calculation in this clause, is zero (because the number of Māori constituency members as so determined is a fraction of the whole number 1 that does not exceed one half),---
        
    *   (a) the region must not be divided into 1 or more Māori constituencies and 1 or more general constituencies:
    
    *   (b) the provisions of [clauses 3][471], [5][467], and [6][468] of this schedule must not be applied for the purposes of any determination under [section 19I][37] or [section 19R][48].

*   (1) In exercising its powers and duties under [sections 19H to 19U][36], and [sections 19W to 19Y][53], a territorial authority or regional council or, as the case may require, the Commission must ensure that any proposal, revised proposal, or determination made under any of those sections is,---
        
    *   (a) in the case of a territorial authority, consistent with the calculations required by [clause 2][335]; and
    
    *   (b) in the case of a regional council, consistent with the result of the calculations required by [clause 4][336].
    
    (2) If it is proposed to alter the proposed number of members of a territorial authority or regional council at any time after that number is first determined in accordance with [clause 1][466] or [clause 3][471], the territorial authority or regional council or, as the case may require, the Commission must again make, in accordance with the method of calculation specified in [clause 2][335] or the method of calculation specified in [clause 4][336], as the case may require, the determinations required by clause 1 or clause 3\.
    
    (3) Subclause (2) does not limit subclause (1).
    
    Compare: 2001 No 1 (L) [s 7][472]

##### 6 Supplementary provisions regarding wards, constituencies, and boundaries
    
*   In determining the number of wards and the boundaries of Māori wards, and the number of constituencies and the boundaries of Māori constituencies, a territorial authority or regional council or, as the case may require, the Commission must, in addition to satisfying the requirements of [section 19T][50] or [section 19U][51],---
