## Provisions applicable where outstanding duplicates of instruments extant

##### 4 Provisions applicable where outstanding duplicates not destroyed
    
*   (1) The provisions of this section shall apply only in cases where certificates of title or other instruments that were registered in the old register or duplicates of instruments that were embodied in the old register have not been destroyed.
    
    (2) In any case to which this section applies, the Registrar may cause copies of such instruments or duplicates as aforesaid to be prepared. Such copies shall, upon being duly authenticated under the hand and seal of the Registrar, and subject to the provisions of this Act, have the same force and effect as the corresponding folios of the old register, or the corresponding original instruments, as the case may be.
    
    (3) In the case of certificates of title, the Registrar, in lieu of making and authenticating copies as provided for in the last preceding subsection, may issue new certificates of title which shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, have the same force and effect as if they were certificates of title issued under the provisions of the principal Act. Every such certificate shall have endorsed thereon a memorandum to the effect that it is issued in lieu of a certificate of title the register copy of which has been destroyed.
    
    (4) In any case where an instrument was executed in triplicate, and whether or not a triplicate was presented for registration, if 2 copies of such instrument have been destroyed, the provisions of subsection [(2)][5] of this section shall apply with respect to the remaining triplicate if the Registrar is satisfied that the same is a true triplicate of such instrument. Unless and until the Registrar endorses thereon a memorandum to the effect that it is conclusive, no such remaining triplicate or duplicate copy adopted in accordance with the next succeeding subsection shall be conclusive as to any memorials that may have been endorsed upon the triplicate that was retained by the Registrar, and the Registrar shall endorse upon it a memorandum that it is not conclusive as to such memorials (if any). Subject to the foregoing provisions of this subsection, every such remaining triplicate or adopted duplicate shall for the purposes of this section be regarded as if it were the registered triplicate upon which memorials were or may have been endorsed by the Registrar.
    
    (5) On the adoption of any triplicate of any registered instrument it shall be lawful for the Registrar to receive with the adopted triplicate 2 copies thereof, and to certify one of such copies free of cost, and to issue the same in substitution for the outstanding duplicate of the instrument upon which memorials are to be endorsed under section [40][35] of the principal Act, and thereafter such copy shall have the same force and effect as if it were the original duplicate upon which memorials may be endorsed by the Registrar.
    
    Subsection (4) was amended, as from 22 December 1933, by section [8(a)][36] Land Transfer (Hawke's Bay) Amendment Act 1933 (1933 No 39) by inserting the words ""or duplicate copy adopted in accordance with the next succeeding subsection"" and ""or adopted duplicate"".
    
    Subsection (5) was inserted, as from 22 December 1933, by section [8(b)][36] Land Transfer (Hawke's Bay) Amendment Act 1933 (1933 No 39).

##### 5 Evidential value of certificates, etc, authenticated under last preceding section
    
*   (1) Except as provided in subsection [(3)][6] hereof, no certificate of title issued under the last preceding section, or issued in substitution for any such certificate of title, or issued in respect of any part of the land comprised in any such certificate of title, and no copy of any instrument authenticated under that section, shall, until the expiration of one year from the date of the issue of such certificate of title, or from the date of the issue of the first such certificate where more than one certificate of title has been issued, or from the date of the Registrar's authentication of such copy, as the case may be, or until the expiration of one year from the date of the passing of this Act, whichever period is the later to expire, be conclusive as to the proprietorship of any mortgage, lease, easement, or _profit á prendre_, or as to the non-existence on the 3rd day of February 1931 of---
        
    *   (a) Any charge created otherwise than by a registered mortgage (not including a sub-mortgage); or
    
    *   (b) Any registered lien; or
    
    *   (c) Any caveat lodged to protect any estate or interest; or
    
    *   (d) Any Proclamation taking the land or any part of it; or
    
    *   (e) Any restriction or other matter in respect of which any memorial may have been registered in the old register; or
    
    *   (f) Any encumbrance upon or other dealing with any mortgage, lease, easement, or _profit á prendre_ registered on or before the said date.
    
    (2) Any person claiming the benefit of any such charge, lien, estate or interest, encumbrance, or other dealing as is referred to in the last preceding subsection may reregister such charge or lien in the manner provided for the registration of the same in the old register, or may lodge a caveat or a new caveat to protect such charge, lien, estate or interest, or encumbrance, or other dealing. Upon the expiration of the time limited by the said subsection every such charge or lien in respect of which a memorial has not been entered on the new register by the Registrar, or that has not been reregistered, or in respect of which a caveat has not been lodged, and every caveat lodged to protect an interest in respect of which a new caveat has not been lodged, shall, as against any person who within the time limited as aforesaid or at any time thereafter becomes a registered proprietor _bona fide_ and for value, be deemed never to have been registered or lodged, as the case may be.
    
    (3) If the Registrar is satisfied, upon such evidence as may seem to him to be sufficient, that the land comprised in any certificate of title or dealt with by any other instrument referred to in the last preceding section was not on the said date subject to any such charge, lien, estate or interest, encumbrance, or other dealing as is mentioned in subsection [(1)][6] of this section, the Registrar may endorse upon the copy prepared and authenticated, or upon the new certificate of title issued, as respectively provided for in the last preceding section, a memorandum to the effect that it is conclusive as to such matters, or as to any one or more of them, and it shall thereupon be conclusive accordingly.

## Provisions applicable where registered instruments and outstanding duplicates destroyed

##### 6 Application for issue of new certificate where outstanding copy destroyed
    
*   (1) Any person claiming to have been on the said date the registered proprietor, or a mortgagee under a registered mortgage, of an estate of freehold, evidenced by any certificate of title, in any land, if he knows or believes that such certificate of title was destroyed, may make application to the Registrar, in the form in the [Schedule][32] to this Act or in such other form as may be prescribed, for the issue of a new certificate of title for such land. Such application shall have endorsed thereon or shall be accompanied by a plan of the land of which the applicant claims to have been the registered proprietor or mortgagee, and shall include a statement of the registered encumbrances, liens, and interests, statutory and other charges, restrictions, and caveats to which, within the knowledge or belief of the applicant, the land was subject; and the statements contained in such application shall be verified by the statutory declaration of the applicant. The plan shall be as full and accurate as the circumstances of each case will permit without the making of a new survey of the land.
    
    (2) The Registrar, if he is satisfied, after the making of such inquiries and the sending of such notices, if any, as he may deem necessary or advisable, that the certificate of title was destroyed, and that the applicant was the registered proprietor or a mortgagee as aforesaid, may issue a new certificate of title for the land the subject of the application.

##### 7 Memorandum of interests admitted by proprietor or mortgagee
    
*   (1) The Registrar shall endorse on every such new certificate of title a memorandum setting forth the encumbrances, liens, and interests, statutory and other charges, restrictions, and caveats to which the land appears to him to be subject.
    
    (2) In any case in which it seems to him proper so to do, the Registrar may at any time cancel any such memorandum, or he may add to or amend the statements contained in any such memorandum, by a further memorandum:
    
    Provided that in any case where by any such addition or amendment it is shown that any interest in the land is subject to any further encumbrance, lien, interest, charge, restriction, or caveat, the Registrar shall forthwith send by registered letter to every registered proprietor adversely affected by such addition or amendment a notice that such addition or amendment has been made.
    
    (3) Every such memorandum shall be _prima facie_ proof of the existence of the estates or interests or of the matters referred to in it.

##### 8 Power of Registrar to issue new certificate where outstanding copy destroyed
    
*   The Registrar, in any case where he knows or believes that the certificate of title for any land was destroyed, may, if it seems to him proper so to do, of his own motion or at the instance of any person claiming an estate or interest in the land, issue a new certificate of title for such land. The provisions of the last preceding section shall, with the necessary modifications, apply to every such certificate of title.

## Interim certificates of title

##### 9 Interim certificate of title
    
*   Every certificate of title issued pursuant to section [6][8] or section [8][10] of this Act shall have endorsed thereon a memorandum to the effect that it is an interim certificate of title.

    (3) Any certificate of title issued in substitution for an interim certificate of title or issued for any part of the land comprised in an interim certificate shall be an interim certificate, with respect to which the provisions of the last preceding subsection shall apply.

##### 11 Application to make interim certificate conclusive
    
*   (1) The registered proprietor, or a mortgagee, of land comprised in an interim certificate of title may at any time make application in writing to the Registrar, to endorse upon such certificate a memorandum that it is conclusive. Such application shall be accompanied by such evidence as may be necessary to establish, without reasonable doubt, the ownership of the land comprised in the certificate of title, and the encumbrances, liens, interests, charges, and restrictions (if any) to which the land is subject.
    
    (2) Upon receipt of any such application the Registrar shall consider the evidence submitted in support thereof, and may require the production of further evidence in support thereof.
    
    (3) If the Registrar is satisfied with any such evidence or further evidence, he shall endorse upon the interim certificate of title a memorandum as provided for by the last preceding section.
    
    (4) If the Registrar is not satisfied with such evidence or further evidence, he may, at the expense of the applicant, publish notice of the application once in the _Gazette_ and twice at an interval of not less than 2 weeks in some newspaper or newspapers published and circulating in the district. Such notice shall limit and appoint a time, not less than the prescribed period, within which any person claiming to have been the registered proprietor of, or claiming to be entitled to the benefit of any encumbrance, lien, or interest upon or in, the land may present for registration an appropriate instrument, in the same manner as if the old register had not been destroyed, for the purpose of re-evidencing such encumbrance, lien, or interest, or may lodge a caveat in the form required by section [137][39] of the principal Act to protect the same, whether such encumbrance, lien, or interest was registered in the old register or not.
    
    (5) After the expiration of the time limited in any such notice, the Registrar shall, unless in his opinion there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary, endorse upon the interim certificate of title for the land referred to in such notice a memorandum to the effect that it is conclusive, or that it is conclusive except as to the description and delineation of the land comprised therein, as to him shall seem proper in the circumstances, and the certificate of title shall thereupon be conclusive according to the tenor of such memorandum; but subject, nevertheless, to the rights, if any, of any person who shall theretofore have lodged a caveat.
    
    (6) The Registrar may at any time thereafter, if he is reasonably satisfied that the interim certificate correctly sets forth the description and delineation of the land comprised therein, endorse a further memorandum to the effect that such certificate of title is conclusive as to the description and delineation of the land, and the certificate shall thereupon be conclusive according to the tenor of such memorandum.
    
    Subsection (4) was amended, as from 1 February 1999, by section 43(3) Land Transfer (Automation) Amendment Act 1998 (1998 No 123) by substituting the expression ""form N"" for the expression ""form L"".

*   Every interim certificate shall, after the expiration of 6 years from the date of its issue, be conclusive as to all matters except the description and delineation of the land comprised therein, whether or not the Registrar has endorsed thereon a memorandum to that effect. For the purposes of this section, in cases when an interim certificate has been issued in substitution for an interim certificate or in respect of part of the land comprised in a former interim certificate, the period of 6 years aforesaid shall begin to run on the date of the issue of the original interim certificate.

## Leasehold interests in Crown lands or other lands administered by the Hawke's Bay Land Board

The Registrar shall thereupon register such new lease or licence in the new register in the manner in which the destroyed lease or licence was registered. Every lease or licence issued under this section shall have endorsed thereon a memorandum to the effect that it is an interim lease or licence.
    
    (2) The provisions of sections [7][9], [9][12], [10][13], [11][14], and [12][15] of this Act shall apply, with the necessary modifications, to every interim lease or licence issued under this section in the same manner as they apply to interim certificates of title.

## Other interests

##### 14 Protection of interests other than freeholds and certain leaseholds
    
*   (1) Any person claiming to have been the registered proprietor on the said date of any estate or interest in or of any charge or lien upon any land, other than an estate of freehold in respect of which a certificate of title existed on the said date, or other than a leasehold interest under a lease or licence embodied in the old register as a folium thereof, and knowing or believing that the instrument under which he claims has been destroyed may, without payment of any fee, lodge a caveat in the form required by section [137][39] of the principal Act to protect such estate or interest, charge, or lien. Every such caveat shall operate to preserve for all purposes the priority of the estate or interest, charge, or lien to protect which such caveat was lodged:
    
    Provided that where pursuant to this section a caveat affecting the land comprised in any certificate of title or in any lease or licence is lodged at any time after an interim certificate of title or an interim lease or licence comprising such land has been made or has become conclusive, in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Act, such caveat shall not operate to affect any estate or interest in such land that may have been acquired for valuable consideration, without notice of the estate or interest, charge, or lien of the caveator:
    
    Provided also that in the case of the land comprised in any certificate of title or other instrument to which section [5][6] of this Act applies, a caveat lodged in accordance with this section shall not affect the estate or interest of a registered proprietor whose right or interest is protected by subsection [(2)][6] of that section.
    
    (2) Upon the registration of an instrument for the purpose of evidencing any such estate or interest, charge, or lien, such caveat shall be deemed to have lapsed.
    
    (3) No such caveat shall prevent the registration of any instrument in which, or by endorsement on which, the rights of the caveator are admitted. The consent of the caveator to the registration of any such instrument shall not be necessary.
    
    Subsection (1) first proviso was amended, as from 22 December 1933, by section [11(a)][42] Land Transfer (Hawke's Bay) Amendment Act 1933 (1933 No 39) by omitting the words ""after the date when such interim certificate, or interim lease or licence, was made or became conclusive as aforesaid"". The second proviso to subsection (1) was inserted by section [11(b)][42] of that Act.
    
    Subsection (1) was amended, as from 1 February 1999, by section 43(3) Land Transfer (Automation) Amendment Act 1998 (1998 No 123) by substituting the expression ""form N"" for the expression ""form L"".
    
    Subsection (1) was amended, as from 17 May 2005, by section [18][41] Land Transfer Amendment Act 2005 (2005 No 58) by substituting the words ""the form required by section 137 of"" for the words ""Form N in the Second Schedule to"".

##### 15 Registered proprietor bound to execute new instruments where originals destroyed
    
*   (1) Every proprietor whose estate or interest is subject to an encumbrance, lien, or interest acquired under or by virtue of an instrument that was destroyed, upon being requested so to do by the person who was on the said date the proprietor of such encumbrance, lien, or interest, or by the successor in title of such person, shall be bound, in the same manner as if he had contracted so to do, but without cost to himself, to execute an appropriate instrument having as nearly as possible the same effect, after registration, as the destroyed instrument had.
    
    (2) No instrument so executed by any such person shall, unless therein expressed or necessarily implied to the contrary as regards the person executing the same, have any greater effect as against any person or any estate or interest than the destroyed instrument had, and no such instrument shall, unless therein expressed or necessarily implied to the contrary, operate so as to relieve any person, other than any party to it, from the obligation to perform any covenant that may have been expressed or implied in any destroyed instrument.
    
    (3) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the principal Act, every new instrument executed and registered to replace a destroyed instrument shall have the same priority over any other instrument as the destroyed instrument had, notwithstanding that such new instrument may be registered subsequently to the registration of such other instrument. Where a new instrument has such priority the Registrar shall add to the memorial of such new instrument a memorandum indicating the priority.

## Maori freehold land

##### 16 Partition orders of Maori freehold land
    
*   (1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Maori Affairs Act 1953, or in any other Act, the Registrar shall not be bound to register any partition order affecting any Maori freehold land or any other land that is or was subject to the jurisdiction of [Te Ture Whenua Maori Act 1993][43], or to register any other order having the effect of vesting in any person an estate of freehold in any such land, unless and until he is reasonably satisfied either---
        
    *   (a) That on the said date there was no interest of any kind and no caveat registered in the old register or under the [Deeds Registration Act 1908][44], as the case may be, affecting the land comprised in such partition order or other order; or
    
    *   (b) That every such interest or caveat has been reregistered or otherwise protected in accordance with the provisions of this Act.
    
    (2) For the purposes of this section the expression _Maori freehold land_ has the same meaning as in [Te Ture Whenua Maori Act 1993][43].
    
    The Native Land Act 1909 was repealed, as from 1 January 1932, by section 558 Native Land Act 1931 (1931 No 31). That Act was in turn repealed, as from 1 April 1954, by section 473(1) Maori Affairs Act 1953 (1953 No 94).
