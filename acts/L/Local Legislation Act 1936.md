    And whereas the said sum of 50,000 pounds was allocated as follows:
        
    *   (a) the sum of 21,000 pounds to the improvement of the main Thames--Paeroa Road from the boundary of the Borough of Thames to the Hikutaia Creek (the said road now being known as the Kopu--Hikutaia section of the Kopu--Raglan (No 17) Main Highway);
    
    *   (b) the sum of 23,000 pounds to the erection of bridges on the said main highway, and the forming, regrading, and metalling of subsidiary roads; and
    
    *   (c) the sum of 6,000 pounds for the purchase of the necessary plant and vehicles to carry out the various works:
    
    And whereas the Council raised a sum of 36,000 pounds of the total amount authorised to be borrowed, and, at the request of the ratepayers in the special rating area, resolved not to raise the balance of the loan amounting to 14,000 pounds:
    
    And whereas the Council expended the sum of 21,000 pounds on the purposes set out in allocation (a), the sum of 6,670 pounds 12 shillings and 7 pence on certain of the purposes set out in allocation (b), and the sum of 6,000 pounds on the purposes set out in allocation (c):
    
    And whereas such expenditure left an unexpended balance of 2,323 pounds 7 shillings and 5 pence in the Loan Account:
    
    And whereas the Council resolved to pay out of the said unexpended balance the premium payable on conversion of the Matatoki Quarry £10,000 Loan amounting to 516 pounds 5 shillings, leaving in hand the sum of 1,807 pounds 2 shillings and 5 pence:
    
    And whereas the Council, having been called upon to re-form and tar-seal the said Kopu--Hikutaia section of the Kopu--Raglan (No 17) Main Highway, applied the said balance of 1,807 pounds 2 shillings and 5 pence towards meeting the cost of the said sealing works:
    
    And whereas the diversion of the said sum of 1,807 pounds 2 shillings and 5 pence to the purposes aforesaid has been approved by the Local Government Loans Board subject to the passing of legislation validating the action of the Council in utilising the said sum towards such purposes:
    
    And whereas it is desirable that the action of the Council should be validated:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    The action of the Council in applying the said sum of 1,807 pounds 2 shillings and 5 pence towards meeting the cost of re-forming and tar-sealing the Kopu--Hikutaia section of the Kopu--Raglan (No 17) Main Highway is hereby validated.

    And whereas the Council proposed to raise a loan of 750 pounds for that purpose under the powers contained in section 195 of the Counties Act 1920:
    
    And whereas, prior to commencing to raise the said loan, the Council proceeded with the erection of the aforesaid dwelling and incurred certain expenditure in connection therewith:
    
    And whereas the Council has now no power to raise a loan for the purpose hereinbefore set out:
    
    And whereas it is desirable that the Council should be authorised to raise a loan of 750 pounds for the purpose of providing the moneys required for the erection of the aforesaid dwelling, and to repay to the General Account of the Council any moneys advanced therefrom for that purpose:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:

    (1) The said rates shall for all purposes be deemed to have been lawfully made, levied, and demanded by the Council.
    
    (2) The Council may in respect of the said rates forthwith determine the sum which, in respect of each ratepayer, represents the difference between the amount that would have been levied in order to produce the amount lawfully required to provide for the payments hereinbefore specified and the amount which was in fact demanded.
    
    (3) The Council may from its General Account refund such sum to any ratepayer who has paid the same or remit such sum in the case of any ratepayer who has not already paid the same.
    
    (4) The power to refund or to remit such sum shall, where the circumstances require, include the power to refund or to remit, as the case may be, such part of the additional charge of 10% as was added to such rates pursuant to the provisions of section 76 of the Rating Act 1925\.

    And whereas the Council expended in carrying out such works sums amounting in the aggregate to 1,058 pounds and 5 shillings, and has received from the said owners and occupiers towards repayment thereof sums amounting in the aggregate to 622 pounds 9 shillings and 3 pence, leaving a balance of 435 pounds 15 shillings and 9 pence still outstanding:
    
    And whereas the Council, in exercise of the powers conferred on it in that behalf by Part 2 of the Local Authorities Interest Reduction and Loans Conversion Act 1932--33 and section 7 of the Local Authorities Interest Reduction and Loans Conversion Amendment Act 1934, respectively, has converted the whole of the loan indebtedness of the Taranaki County convertible thereunder, and as security therefor has made a consolidated special rate over all the rateable property in the said county on a differential basis over the various ridings of the said county and has also made and levied a similar rate to produce the annual charges payable in respect of all the non-convertible securities of the said county:

    And whereas it is just and equitable that they should be relieved from such liability:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:

    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][103] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][104] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][105] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][106] and [17E][107] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
