##### 1 Short Title
    
*   This Act may be cited as the Local Legislation Act 1932--33\.

#### County Councils

##### 2 Validating deposit of loan moneys by Pahiatua County Council with a bank outside New Zealand
    
*   Whereas the Pahiatua County Council (hereinafter called the _Council_) for the purpose of reconstructing certain bridges in the Pahiatua County borrowed the sum of 3,400 pounds from the National Mutual Life Association of Australasia, Limited, and issued debentures providing for the repayment of the said loan by half-yearly instalments of principal and interest payable at the Bank of New Zealand in Melbourne in the State of Victoria in the Commonwealth of Australia:
    
    And whereas after the completion of the said works there remained unexpended a balance of 611 pounds out of the said loan moneys:
    
    And whereas the said National Mutual Life Association of Australasia, Limited, refused to allow any interest upon the said sum of 611 pounds if the said sum had been applied in reduction of the amount of the said loan by paying certain of the said debentures before their due dates:
    
    And whereas in order that the said sum may earn interest pending the arrival of such due dates and also to obtain the benefit of the advantageous rate of exchange the Council has deposited the said sum of 611 pounds upon several fixed deposits with the Bank of Australasia at Melbourne so that the dates for repayment of the said fixed deposits approximately coincide with the due dates of such debentures:
    
    And whereas there being no statutory authority authorising the Council to invest moneys outside New Zealand it is desired to validate the said action of the Council:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    The investment by the Council of the said sum of 611 pounds upon several fixed deposits with the Bank of Australasia at Melbourne as aforesaid is hereby declared to have been lawfully made.

##### 3 Validating overpayment of interest by Coromandel County Council
    
*   Whereas the Coromandel County Council (hereinafter called the _Council_) was on 14 December 1929 duly authorised by the ratepayers of the Coromandel County to raise for the purpose of constructing a new wharf at Mercury Bay a loan of 2,000 pounds, such loan to bear interest at the rate of 5.5% per annum:
    
    And whereas the Council raised the said loan by issuing debentures for 2,000 pounds on which interest was agreed to be paid at the rate of 5.75% per annum and has been paid at that rate from 1 January 1931 to 30 June 1932, but the debenture holders have agreed to the reduction of the rate to 5.5% per annum as from the last-mentioned date:
    
    And whereas the overpayment of interest at the rate of 0.25% per annum over the said period amounts to 7 pounds 10 shillings:
    
    And whereas it is expedient to validate the said overpayment:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    The overpayment by the Council of interest as aforesaid amounting to 7 pounds 10 shillings is hereby validated and declared to have been lawfully made.

##### 4 Authorising Rangitikei County Council to collect special rate
    
*   Whereas the Rangitikei County Council (hereinafter referred to as the _Council_) has been authorised to raise a special loan of 1,000 pounds (hereinafter referred to as the _said loan_) for the purpose of surveying, legalising, forming, and metalling the Toe Toe Road from the Rangitikei River to the Potaka Road:
    
    And whereas the Council has made and levied a special rate over the Toe Toe Road No 2 special rating area (hereinafter referred to as the _special rating area_) as security for the said loan:
    
    And whereas the Council has been unable to raise the said loan upon the terms authorised and authority has been granted pursuant to section 47 of the Finance Act 1929 for the Council to utilise an amount not exceeding 1,000 pounds of the unexpended balance of the Vinegar Hill Bridge Loan (1926) for carrying out the works hereinbefore mentioned:
    
    And whereas such authority has been granted subject to the Council obtaining legislative authority to collect the special rate levied as security for the said loan and to pay the proceeds into the County Fund for the purpose of meeting a part of the interest and sinking fund charges on the said Vinegar Hill Bridge Loan (1926):
    
    And whereas it is expedient that the Council should be so authorised:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    (1) The Council is hereby empowered to collect on all rateable property within the special rating area for a period of 20 years the special rate made and levied over such area as security for the said loan to an amount sufficient to pay interest at the rate of 5.75% per annum and sinking fund at the rate of 3% per annum on the sum of 1,000 pounds diverted as aforesaid, and to pay the proceeds of such special rate into the County Fund, and to apply such proceeds towards providing part of the interest and sinking fund on the said Vinegar Hill Bridge Loan (1926).
    
    (2) Nothing herein contained shall limit the powers of the Council pursuant to section 23 of the Local Bodies' Loans Act 1926 to amend the special rate made and levied as security for the said loan.

    And whereas pursuant to the provisions of section 168 of the Public Works Act 1928 the consent of the Minister of Public Works was obtained in the manner provided by that section:
    
    And whereas it is expedient that the action of the Corporation in entering into the said deed should be validated:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    The said deed and all the terms, conditions, covenants, agreements, and provisions therein contained are hereby validated and confirmed as from the date of the execution thereof.

##### 6 Authorising agreement by Hutt County Council as to laying of conduit pipe
    
*   The Corporation of the County of Hutt (hereinafter called the _corporation_) is hereby authorised to grant to Associated Motorists Petrol Company, Limited (hereinafter called the _company_), the right to lay a conduit pipe under and along Main Day's Bay Road, in the County of Hutt, together with the right to convey oil and petroleum products through such pipe, and for this purpose the Corporation is further authorised to enter into a deed with the company conferring such rights and containing such terms, conditions, covenants, agreements, and provisions as may be mutually agreed upon by and between the Corporation and the company:
    
    provided that no such deed shall have any force or effect unless and until the consent of the Minister of Public Works has been endorsed thereon.

##### 7 Authorising Hawke's Bay County Council to credit certain sums to the Clive and Poukawa Ridings and debit same against certain ridings
    
*   Whereas extensive permanent pavement work was carried out on main highways within the Clive and Poukawa Ridings of the Hawke's Bay County, and by reason of such highways not having been declared to be main roads under paragraph (c) of section 131 of the Counties Act 1920 the expenditure on such work was debited against the separate accounts for the said ridings:
    
    And whereas it is expedient that such expenditure should be apportioned among the separate accounts for certain other ridings as well as the said Clive and Poukawa Ridings as hereinafter provided:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    The Hawke's Bay County Council is hereby authorised to credit the separate account for the Clive Riding with the sum of 1,985 pounds 11 shillings and 8 pence, and to credit the separate account for the Poukawa Riding with the sum of 1,051 pounds 13 shillings and 1 penny, and to debit such sums against the separate accounts for the Clive, Havelock, Maraekakaho, Meeanee, Okawa, Petane, Poukawa, Puketapu, and Waimarama Ridings of the said county in proportion to the capital value of the rateable property in each of such ridings as at 31 March 1932\.

    And whereas the said Local Authorities Empowering (Relief of Unemployment) Act 1926 contains no sufficient provisions for the raising of loans thereunder on the security of a special rate over part only of a legal subdivision:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    The Council shall for all purposes be deemed to have been lawfully empowered under the said Local Authorities Empowering (Relief of Unemployment) Act 1926 to raise the said loan by special order on the security of the said special rate over the said special rating area, and to make and pledge as security for the said loan the said special rate.

    And whereas, of the said sum of 50,000 pounds, the sum of 21,000 pounds was allocated to the improvement of the main Thames--Paeroa Road from the Thames Borough boundary to the Hikutaia Creek:
    
    And whereas of the said 21,000 pounds so borrowed, the sum of 16,145 pounds 19 shillings and 7 pence has been expended, leaving an unexpended balance of 4,854 pounds and 5 pence:
    
    And whereas a further sum of 6,000 pounds (part of the said loan of 50,000 pounds) was allocated to the purpose of the purchase of the necessary plant and vehicles to carry out the various works for which the loan was raised:
    
    And whereas the said sum of 6,000 pounds was borrowed for a term of 10 years only, but the sinking fund provided therefor was 1% per annum and at the date of maturity (1 May 1932) amounted to 695 pounds 13 shillings and 5 pence:
    
    And whereas at that date the sum of 5,474 pounds 6 shillings and 1 penny of the loan of 6,000 pounds had been expended, leaving an unexpended balance of 525 pounds 13 shillings and 11 pence:
    
    And whereas the Thames County Council has utilised the said unexpended balance of 525 pounds 13 shillings and 11 pence and the sum of 4,778 pounds 12 shillings and 8 pence of the aforesaid unexpended balance of 4,854 pounds and 5 pence to augment the sinking fund of 695 pounds 13 shillings and 5 pence, and has repaid the said loan of 6,000 pounds:

    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    The action of the Thames County Council in applying the unexpended portion of the said 6,000 pounds loan and the sum of 4,778 pounds 12 shillings and 8 pence of the unexpended portion of the said 21,000 pounds loan towards repayment of the said loan of 6,000 pounds is hereby validated and confirmed.

##### 12 Authorising payment of compassionate allowance by Levels County Council
    
*   Whereas the Levels County Council in 1932 resolved to grant the sum of 100 pounds as a compassionate allowance to the widow of the late Frank Edmund Whitehead, who was formerly Clerk to the said Council:
    
    And whereas the said Council has no legal authority to make such grant:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:

##### 15 Validating certain rates of Marlborough County Council
    
*   Whereas it appears that the rates made and levied by the Marlborough County Council (hereinafter called the _Council_) for the years ending on 31 March 1931, 1932, and 1933, respectively (hereinafter referred to as the _said rates_), cannot be legally recovered by reason of certain irregularities in connection therewith:
    
    And whereas demands in writing for payment of the said rates were made and delivered, a large percentage of the said rates have been paid by divers ratepayers, and it is advisable in the public interest and to prevent injustice to validate the said rates and to authorise the recovery of the balance thereof:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    The rates made and levied or which the Council purported to make and levy in and for the above-mentioned years as appearing in the rate books of the Council shall be valid and be deemed to have been valid from the date when the Council purported to make and levy the said rates respectively; the demands made for payment of the said rates shall be valid and be deemed to have been valid, and the said rates shall be recoverable by action notwithstanding the said irregularities or the omission of any conditions whatsoever precedent to the making or levying of the said rates or any irregularity, mistake, or omission in the form or manner of making or levying the same or otherwise; and valid demands upon all persons liable for the said rates shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly made and delivered in accordance with law.
