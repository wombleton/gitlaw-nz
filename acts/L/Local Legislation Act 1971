##### 2 Empowering Corporation of Borough of Devonport to transfer O'Neill's Point Cemetery to Corporation of City of Takapuna
    
*   Whereas by deed of conveyance dated 12 May 1890 and registered in the Deeds Registry Office at Auckland under No 117243 the land described in subsection (2) (in this section referred to as the **land**) was vested in the Mayor, Councillors, and Citizens of the Borough of Devonport (in this section referred to as the **Corporation**) to be used as a public cemetery: 
    
    And whereas the Corporation has since then used the land as a public cemetery:
    
    And whereas it is now expedient that the land be vested in the Mayor, Councillors, and Citizens of the City of Takapuna (in this section referred to as the **City Corporation**) and that the land should continue to be used by the City Corporation for cemetery purposes:
    
    And whereas the Corporation has no authority to transfer the land, and the City Corporation is precluded by the provisions of [section 21(1)][19] of the Burial and Cremation Act 1964 from using the said land, which is situated in its district, for cemetery purposes:
    
    And whereas it is desirable that provision be made empowering the Corporation to transfer the land to the City Corporation and for the City Corporation to continue to use it for cemetery purposes:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows.
    
    (1) Notwithstanding anything in the [Burial and Cremation Act 1964][20] or in any other Act---
        
    *   (a) the Corporation is hereby empowered to transfer the land to the City Corporation for the purposes of a public cemetery and to hand over to the City Corporation all records and assets pertaining to the land which the City Corporation may require:
    
    *   (b) the City Corporation is hereby empowered and authorised to use the land for cemetery purposes:
    
    *   (c) the bylaws of the Corporation pertaining to the operation of the land as a cemetery shall continue to apply to the land and shall be enforceable by the City Corporation until the City Corporation repeals them and enacts bylaws in their place.
    
    (2) The land to which this section relates is more particularly described as follows:
    
    8 acres 2 roods, more or less, being part of Allotment 13 of Section 1 of the Parish of Takapuna, as the same is delineated on deposited plan No  884, and being the whole of the land comprised and described in certificate of title, Volume 59, folio 208, North Auckland Registry, together with appurtenant drainage rights created by Transfer No  252451\.

##### 3 Authorising refund by Papakura Borough Council to District Fund Account from loan money
    
*   Whereas before the Papakura Borough Council (in this section referred to as the **Council**) obtained authority to raise a loan of $18,000 known as Pensioner Flats (Don Street) Additional Loan 1969 (in this section referred to as the **loan**), the Council expended out of its District Fund Account for certain purposes for which the loan was to be raised the sum of $10,073.47: 
    
    And whereas authority to raise the loan has since been obtained and it is desirable to authorise the Council to refund that sum to its District Fund Account out of the proceeds of the loan:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    The Council is hereby authorised to refund the sum of $10,073.47 to its District Fund Account out of the proceeds of the loan.

##### 4 Varying the purposes to which certain trust money may be applied by Southland Hospital Board
    
*   Whereas, pursuant to the last will of Jessie Ewart who died at Auckland in 1940, the sum of $40 was paid to the Southland Hospital Board (hereinafter referred to as the **Board**) on 8 September 1941 to be expended for the benefit of the children who were patients in the Southland Hospital at the time the money was received:
    
    And whereas the said money has been held in trust by the Board since that date and consequently the terms of the bequest can no longer be complied with:
    
    And whereas the Board wishes to use the said sum and the income arising therefrom for the purchase of toys, books, and other recreational equipment for the school classroom in the children's ward at Southland Hospital, but this is not in accord with the terms of the said bequest:
    
    And whereas the Board is desirous of altering the terms of the said bequest accordingly:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Act or rule of law or in the last will of the said Jessie Ewart---
        
    *   (a) the said sum paid to the Board pursuant to the said will and the income arising therefrom may be applied and used by the Board for the purchase of toys, books, and other recreational equipment for the school classroom in the children's ward at Southland Hospital:
    
    *   (b) the failure to comply with the terms of the bequest shall be deemed not to have been a breach of trust.
    
    

##### 5 Including certain land within the City of Napier
    
*   Whereas pursuant to the provisions of the [Napier Harbour Board and Napier Borough Enabling Act 1933][21], certain land owned by the Napier Harbour Board was deemed to be included within the City of Napier:
    
    And whereas the land described in subsection (2) (in this section referred to as the **land**) did not form part of the Napier Harbour Board's title at that date and was therefore not included within the City of Napier:
    
    And whereas it is desirable that the land should be declared to have been included within the City of Napier on and after 20 December 1933:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    (1) Notwithstanding anything in the Municipal Corporations Act 1954 or in any other Act, the land is hereby declared to have been included within the City of Napier on and after 20 December 1933\.

    And whereas the Local Authorities Loans Board has no authority to sanction the raising of a loan for the purpose of enabling the Council to refund that sum to its County Fund Account:
    
    And whereas it is desirable to authorise the Council to raise a loan of not more than $27,500 for the purpose of recouping its County Fund Account in respect of the sum so expended from that Account:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    The Council is hereby authorised and empowered to borrow by way of special loan under the Local Authorities Loans Act 1956 an amount not exceeding $27,500 for the purpose of refunding to its County Fund Account the sum so expended from that Account; and, notwithstanding anything in section 34 of that Act, the special loan may be raised without the prior consent of the ratepayers.

    And whereas it is necessary to make special provision to enable the Council to establish the said endowment fund:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    (1) The Council is hereby authorised to establish a separate bank account to be known as the Electrical Endowment Fund (in this section referred to as the **Fund**), and, without further or other authority than this section and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in section 104 of the Local Authorities Loans Act 1956 but subject to paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (4) of that section, the Council shall pay into the Fund the said sum of $8,640 and the net money received from the Board by way of reduction of principal under the said debenture.

    The Council is hereby authorised and empowered to borrow by way of special loan under the Local Authorities Loans Act 1956 an amount not exceeding $200,000 for the purpose of refunding to its District Fund Account the sum expended and to be expended from that account as aforesaid; and, notwithstanding anything in section 34 of that Act, the special loan may be raised without the prior consent of the ratepayers.

    And whereas the Council wishes to assist the employee with the acquisition of an existing residential dwelling in the Borough for his personal occupation, and wishes, pursuant to section 338 of the Municipal Corporations Act 1954, to guarantee portion of a mortgage to be executed between the employee and a financial institution:
    
    And whereas the provisions of the said section do not apply to the acquisition of an existing house:

    And whereas the unclaimed money was made up of an amount of $600 deposited in the Post Office Savings Bank on 31 October 1946 from an account known as the Havelock North Town Board Chairman's Fund Account, which amount is believed to have been raised principally to send parcels to soldiers overseas, and a further amount of $400, being an amount transferred from the said Havelock North Town Board Chairman's Fund Account to the Havelock North Mayor's Trust Account and thence to the said Post Office Savings Bank Account on 5 January 1954, together with accumulated interest on those amounts:
    
    And whereas the Council intended to apply the unclaimed money towards the development of Anderson Park No 2 but doubts arose as to whether the amount of $600 at least should not have been paid to the Hawke's Bay Provincial Patriotic Council as being money raised for patriotic purposes under the Patriotic Purposes Emergency Regulations 1939 and not being otherwise disposed of by 1 April 1952:
    
    And whereas the council applied certain money from its Subdivision Reserve Account towards the development of the Park in anticipation of being able to expend the unclaimed money for that purpose:
    
    And whereas the Council wishes to reimburse its Subdivision Reserve Account from the unclaimed money:

    And whereas a portion of the finance for the said contract has been obtained by way of a grant of the sum of $15,000 from the J. B. S. Dudding Trust:
    
    And whereas payment of the said grant is to be made to the Council in 3 instalments each of $5,000 in the years ending 31 March 1972, 1973, and 1974:

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Local Legislation Act 1971\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 20 May 1999, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][27] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][28] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][29] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][30] and [17E][31] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
