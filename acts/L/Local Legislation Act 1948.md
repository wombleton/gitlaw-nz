    And whereas the excess liabilities of the Council in terms of the said Act as at 31 March 1948 amounted to 17,937 pounds 2 shillings and 3 pence:
    
    And whereas the aforesaid excess borrowing and owing of moneys and incurring of liabilities were due to exceptional conditions in the County of Buller beyond the control of the Council and it is desirable to make provision in manner hereinafter appearing:
