##### 120 Advances to purchase additional lease or licence
    
*   Where the Board is satisfied that the area of Crown land held by any lessee or licensee is too small to be successfully occupied as an independent farm unit, it may authorise the making of an advance to enable him to purchase the interest of a lessee or licensee in any other Crown land which can be conveniently farmed with the land already held.

##### 121 Security for advances
    
*   (1) All money advanced under the last 2 preceding sections shall be secured by way of mortgage to the Crown over the lessee's or licensee's interest in the land and, in the case of an advance for the purchase of livestock and chattels, by a bill of sale over his livestock and chattels. Any such mortgage and bill of sale shall be in such form, for such term, and subject to such conditions as the Board may approve, and at such rate of interest as may be approved by the Minister of Finance.
    
    (2) If any such advance is secured by mortgage providing for payment of principal and interest by instalments, and the lessee or licensee (not being in arrear with any previous instalment or other payment due under his lease or licence) pays an instalment on or before its due date, or within 1 month after its due date, he shall be entitled to a rebate of such proportion as may be fixed by the Minister of Finance of so much of the instalment as consists of interest. Any rebate under this subsection may be deducted and retained by the lessee or licensee from the full amount of the instalment when making the payment. For the purposes of this subsection a payment of an instalment shall be deemed to have been made within the period of 1 month if within that period it is in course of transmission by post to the Department.

    (2) Every lessee who has complied with all the conditions of his lease may at any time during the currency of his lease acquire the fee simple of the land comprised therein upon the terms and subject to the conditions defined and at a price ascertained and determined in the manner provided by this section.
    
    (3) The right of purchase hereby conferred may be exercised by giving notice to the Commissioner and at the same time paying the prescribed valuation fee.
    
    (4) The delivery of the notice to the Commissioner shall constitute a contract between the lessee and the Crown for the purchase and sale of the land.
    
    (5) As soon as possible after receipt of the notice, the Board shall cause the following values to be ascertained:
        
    *   (a) the value of the improvements which are then in existence and unexhausted on the land included in the lease:
    
    *   (b) the value at the commencement of the lease of all improvements included in the rental value at the commencement of the lease:
    
    *   (c) the value of the land included in the lease exclusive of the improvements referred to in paragraph (a):
        
        provided that, subject to the provisions of this Act,---
            
        *   (i) in ascertaining the values under paragraphs (a) and (c) equal emphasis shall be placed on the value to be ascertained under each paragraph:
        
        *   (ii) the values shall be ascertained on an equitable basis, having regard to the relationship between lessor and lessee:
        
        *   (iii) the sum of the values under paragraphs (a) and (c) shall be equal to the capital value of the land:
        
        *   (iv) the determination of the Board of the value under paragraph (b) shall be final and binding on all persons interested therein.
        
        
    
    (6) For the purposes of the last preceding subsection, the expression _capital value_ means the sum which the land and improvements thereon might be expected to realise at the time of valuation if offered for sale, unencumbered by any mortgage or other charge thereon, on such reasonable terms and conditions as a bona fide seller might be expected to require.
    
    (7) Subject to the rights of the lessee under subsection (10), the purchase price of the land shall be the sum of the values under paragraphs (b) and (c) of subsection (5), less the value of any goodwill the lessee may have in his lease calculated in accordance with subsection (7A).
    
    (7A) For the purpose of calculating the value of the goodwill (if any) of the lessee in his lease, the following provisions shall apply:
        
    *   (a) the Board shall first ascertain---
            
        *   (i) the amount of the yearly rent on the purchase price of the land established under subsection (7) (excluding any provision for goodwill) calculated at a percentage of that purchase price, which percentage shall be determined in accordance with subsection (7B):
        
        *   (ii) the unexpired term of the lease, which for the purposes of this subsection shall be the unexpired term of the current period of 11 years of the lease, or, where there is no provision in the lease for a review of rent at successive periods of 11 years, the unexpired term of the lease or 11 years, whichever is the lesser:
        
        
    
    *   (b) the value of the lessee's goodwill in the lease shall then be calculated on an actuarial basis as the lessee's interest in the present value of the excess (if any) of the annual rent, established under subparagraph (i) of paragraph (a), over the annual rent payable under the lease for the unexpired term ascertained under subparagraph (ii) of that paragraph. The rate of interest for the purpose of the calculation shall be equal to the percentage of the purchase price adopted in order to ascertain the amount of the yearly rent for the purposes of subparagraph (i) of paragraph (a), calculated with half-yearly rests:
    
    *   (c) where the Board is of the opinion that, in the case of a lease of farm land, the value ascertained under paragraph (c) of subsection (5) includes a potential value for purposes other than farming purposes, the Board shall also ascertain the value of the land as if unaffected by that potential value, and the value so ascertained shall, notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (i) of paragraph (a), be used for the purpose of calculating the value of the lessee's goodwill in the lease under this subsection.
    
    (7B) For the purposes of paragraph (a) of subsection (7A), the yearly rent shall be calculated---
        
    *   (a) at the percentage or proportion of the rental value prescribed by or under any Act by which the yearly rent was determined for the current term of the lease:
    
    *   (b) at 4.5% of the rental value, in any case where the yearly rent for the current term of the lease was determined in any other manner or where no specific percentage or proportion was so prescribed.
    
    (7C) For the purposes of subsection (7A), and notwithstanding anything in that subsection or in subsection (7B),---
        
    *   (a) where the lessee is a serviceman or discharged serviceman and the yearly rent has been determined pursuant to [section 29][368] of the Statutes Amendment Act 1943 or subsection (5) of [section 63][94] of this Act or the lessee is in receipt of a concession allowed by the Board under [section 153][210] of this Act, then, notwithstanding the provisions of the lease, the percentage or proportion of the rental value of the land and the rental value of the land shall be the percentage or proportion of the rental value of the land and the rental value of the land, respectively, which would become applicable on the transfer, sublease, or other disposition of the lease to any person not being a serviceman or discharged serviceman:
    
    *   (b) where the lessee has been granted any other concession by the Board, no account shall be taken of that concession:
    
    *   (c) where land has been incorporated in a lease pursuant to [section 113][159] and the current yearly rent payable under the lease has been determined in more than one manner or by more than 1% or proportion of the rental value of the land, then, subject to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection, the yearly rent shall be calculated at 4.5% of the rental value of the land.
    
    (8) As soon as practicable after the values have been ascertained under subsection (5), and the value of the lessee's goodwill (if any) in the lease has been ascertained under subsection (7A), the Commissioner shall deliver to the lessee a notice in writing informing him of those values, the amount of the value of the goodwill (if any), and the purchase price of the land.
    
    (9) If the Board omits to cause the said values to be ascertained, or the Commissioner omits to deliver the said notice to the lessee within such time as may be reasonable, the lessee may require the values to be ascertained and notice to be given at any time thereafter, so long as he remains in possession of the land, whether the term of his lease has or has not expired, and his right to acquire the fee simple shall not be affected by any such omission or delay.
    
    (10) Within 1 month after the receipt of the notice referred to in subsection (8), the lessee shall elect by notice in writing to the Commissioner whether to purchase the land for cash or on deferred payments, and shall state in the notice whether he agrees to the purchase price set out in the notice given him by the Commissioner, or whether he requires the purchase price to be determined by the Land Valuation Tribunal as hereinafter provided. If the lessee omits to give to the Commissioner within the time limited therefor notice of his election as aforesaid, he shall be deemed to have agreed to the values set out in the notice given him by the Commissioner and to have elected to purchase the fee simple for cash at the purchase price set out therein.
    
    (11) The right of purchase conferred by this section on the holder of a lease in perpetuity, or of a licence for occupation with right of purchase, or of any lease under which the lessee or licensee has the right to acquire the fee simple at a price specified in the lease or licence, or of any lease over any land acquired by the Crown under [section 85][257] of the Maori Reserved Land Act 1955 or any former Maori Townships Act, shall be in addition to and not in substitution for any right which the lessee or licensee already has of acquiring the fee simple of the land conferred by his lease or licence or by any former Land Act.
