*   \[Repealed\]

##### 4 Validating allocation of interest charges on bridges loan of £209,000 raised by Patangata County Council
    
*   Whereas the Patangata County Council (hereinafter called the _Council_) pursuant to a proposal carried by the ratepayers of the Patangata County on 22 March 1921 was authorised to raise a loan of 209,000 pounds (hereinafter called the _said loan_) for the purpose of re-erecting and renewing all the bridges and culverts in the said county, the sum of 171,992 pounds being allocated to the several ridings of the said county, and the remainder to the general purposes of the county:
    
    And whereas of the amount authorised the sum of 60,000 pounds has been raised and expended:
    
    And whereas the security for the said loan was stated in the proposal as set out in the voting paper to be an annual special rate of 3 farthings in the pound, to be made and levied on the capital value of all rateable property in the Patangata County, such rate to be an annual-recurring rate until the said loan is repaid:
    
    And whereas the Council passed a special order on 7 February 1922 providing that in lieu of a special rate of 3 farthings in the pound on the capital value of all rateable property in the Patangata County, special rates to the extent necessary to meet interest, sinking fund, and other charges upon the amount of the said loan expended in each riding be struck and levied on the capital value of each riding:
    
    And whereas the action of the Council was without authority of law:
    
    And whereas it is now desired that such unlawful action be validated in respect of the period up to and including 31 March 1934, and that authority be given to strike similar special rates over the several ridings for the year ending on 31 March 1935:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    (1) The action of the Council hitherto in paying the annual charges on the said loan out of riding funds in proportion to the amounts of the said loan expended in the respective ridings is hereby validated.
    
    (2) The Council may make and levy special rates to the extent necessary to provide for the annual charges on the said loan for the year ending on 31 March 1935 upon the basis set out in the last preceding subsection.

##### 5 Fixing boundaries of Sounds County
    
*   Whereas doubts have arisen as to the boundaries of the County of Sounds:
    
    And whereas it is desirable to remove such doubts and to fix the boundaries of the said county:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    The County of Sounds is hereby declared to consist of---
    
    All those areas of land above mean high-water mark situated in the Nelson and Marlborough Land Districts, including the mainland and islands lying within an area bounded by a line commencing at a point on the sea coast at Pukerau Point; thence along a right line running due north to its intersection with the parallel of latitude 40°30′S; thence due east along that parallel of latitude to its intersection with the meridian of longitude 174°30′E; thence due south along that meridian to a point due east of the southernmost point of White's Bay; thence along a right line to the southernmost point of White's Bay; thence along the boundaries of the Marlborough County as described in the _Gazette_ of 10 March 1932, page 473, to North Castor Peak; thence along a right line from North Castor Peak to Pukerau Point, the place of commencement.

##### 6 Legalising a special loan of £4,000 raised by the Waitotara County Council in respect of the Ahu Ahu Special-rating District
    
*   Whereas on 17 November 1911 the Waitotara County Council (hereinafter called the _Council_) was, pursuant to section 15 of the Local Bodies' Loans Act 1908, authorised by ratepayers of portion of the County of Waitotara to raise a special loan of 4,000 pounds (hereinafter referred to as the _said loan_) on the security of a special rate over a portion of the county known for the purposes of the said loan as the Ahu Ahu Special-rating District (hereinafter referred to as the _Ahu Ahu District_):
    
    And whereas the Ahu Ahu District was incorrectly defined by the Council:
    
    And whereas such special rate was made as a rate of 2 pence and 1 farthing in the pound on the rateable value of all rateable property in the Ahu Ahu District:
    
    And whereas the said loan was raised under the New Zealand State-guaranteed Advances Act 1909 as to portion thereof at one rate of interest and as to another portion thereof at a higher rate of interest than that contemplated when such special rate was made and levied:
    
    And whereas it accordingly became necessary to make provision in addition to such special rate to meet the increased annual payments in respect of the said loan:
    
    And whereas in making such additional provision pursuant to section 3 of the New Zealand State-guaranteed Advances Amendment Act 1912 the Council mistakenly made a special rate of 2 pence and three-eighths of a penny instead of one-eighth of a penny in the pound on the rateable value of all rateable property in the Ahu Ahu District:
    
    And whereas it is expedient to make provision as hereinafter appears to legalise the said loan:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    (1) It is hereby declared that the said loan shall for all purposes be deemed to have been lawfully raised by the Council.

    *   Section 1, Block 9, Tauakira Survey District: 1 202 acres.

    *   (a) on 8 January 1912, a special rate of 2 pence and 1 farthing in the pound on the rateable value of all rateable property in the Ahu Ahu District for the purposes of the said loan; and
    
    *   (b) on 3 March 1913, pursuant to subsection (1) of section 3 of the New Zealand State-guaranteed Advances Amendment Act 1912, a special rate of one-eighth of a penny in the pound on the rateable value of all such rateable property as aforesaid to meet the increased annual payments in respect of the said loan consequent on part thereof having been raised at such higher rate of interest as aforesaid.
    
    (4) All relevant resolutions of the Council and notices in the _Gazette_ and other relevant instruments, documents, and papers in respect of the said loan shall be read as at all times defining the Ahu Ahu District to consist of the lands mentioned in subsection (2), and as mentioning the said rate of one-eighth of a penny instead of a rate of 2 pence and three-eighths of a penny as aforesaid.
    
    (5) The raising by the Council of an additional loan of 10% of the said loan and the making of a special rate of 1 farthing in the pound on the rateable value of all rateable property in the Ahu Ahu District in connection with such additional loan shall not be questioned in any court on any ground whatever.

    And whereas, although such compromise and exchange of debentures was made in good faith, it was without authority of law and it is desirable to validate it:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    The action of the Board in issuing to the creditor 3 several debentures, numbered 31, 32, and 33, for 100 pounds, each repayable respectively as to Numbers 31 and 32 on 28 March 1944, and as to Number 33 on 28 March 1945, is hereby validated, and such 3 several debentures declared to have been lawfully issued.

    And whereas the said district enures for the purposes of Part 2 of the Rabbit Nuisance Act 1928 and it is deemed to have been constituted thereunder:
    
    And whereas a Board of Trustees for the said district has never been established according to law, and it is deemed desirable to abolish the said district:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    The Blackstone Hill Rabbit District is hereby abolished.

    (1) The Trustees are hereby authorised to grant a lease to the association of the land hereinafter described for a period of 40 years at an annual rental of 100 pounds, and upon such further terms and conditions as may be agreed upon between the Trustees and the association.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Local Legislation Act 1934\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 4 September 1950, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][61] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][62] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][63] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][64] and [17E][65] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
