##### 6 Authorising Hobson County Council to raise a special loan of £3,250 for drainage works
    
*   Whereas the Minister of Public Works has agreed to undertake certain drainage works in the drainage area, hereinafter described, in the County of Hobson (hereinafter referred to as the _said drainage area_) at an estimated cost of 20,000 pounds, provided the ratepayers within the said drainage area contribute the sum of 3,250 pounds towards the cost of the proposed drainage works:
    
    And whereas the Hobson County Council (hereinafter called the _Council_) instead of obtaining such contribution proposes to raise a loan of 3,250 pounds:
    
    And whereas the Council proposes to offer as security for the proposed loan a special rate over all the rateable property in the said county:
    
    And whereas the Council proposes to strike the special rate aforesaid over all the rateable property in the said county, but is desirous of collecting the amount required to meet the annual charges on the said loan from those ratepayers whose rateable property is within the said drainage area as being the only ratepayers within the County of Hobson whose properties will benefit from the carrying out of the said drainage works:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    (1) The Council is hereby authorised and empowered to raise a special loan, not exceeding a sum of 3,250 pounds, upon the security of a special rate over all the rateable property in the said county for the purpose of contributing the sum hereinbefore mentioned towards the cost of the said drainage works:
    
    provided that at the poll taken in respect of the loan only the ratepayers owning rateable property within the said drainage area shall be entitled to vote.

##### 7 Authorising Hauraki Plains County Council to acquire a water main for water-supply district and making special provision in connection therewith

    And whereas for the purpose of such water-supply system a loan of 2,000 pounds, called the Pekapeka Road Water-supply Loan, maturing on 1 September 1946, was raised and secured by a special rate of 1 penny and 3 farthings in the pound on the unimproved value of all the property in such water-supply district which was constituted a special-rating area:
    
    And whereas a sinking fund for such loan was established by annual contributions of 40 pounds, and the Public Trustee is the Sinking Fund Commissioner thereof:
    
    And whereas the Council is now instituting a major water-supply system for the supply of water from the Thames mountain range to the eastern part of the Hauraki Plains County, and for that purpose has constituted a water-supply district under the said Act called the Hauraki Plains East Water-supply District, and also a special-rating area called the Hauraki Plains East Water-supply Special-rating Area:
    
    And whereas such last-mentioned water-supply district and special-rating area include both the Pekapeka Road Water-supply District and the Pekapeka Road Water-supply Special-rating Area:
    
    And whereas the major system is designed to supply good pure water at gravitational pressure, and it is desirable that the Pekapeka Road water-supply system be converted to the major system aforesaid to afford to the ratepayers therein the benefits of the purer water and greater pressure which the major system is designed to supply:
    
    And whereas to effect such conversion it is necessary that the Hauraki Plains East Water-supply District and Special-rating Area shall take over the existing water main in the Pekapeka Road Water-supply District at the valuation thereof of 500 pounds, and that the Council be authorised to apply the loan moneys and other funds of the Hauraki Plains East Water-supply Special-rating Area in payment of 500 pounds as the purchase price for such main into the sinking fund for the Pekapeka water-supply loan and in payment of the capital of such loan at the maturity thereof to the extent to which the accumulated sinking fund therefor shall or may be insufficient, and also to apply the revenue of such last-mentioned special-rating area in payment of interest and sinking fund instalments on such loan as and when the same shall become due:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    (1) The Council is hereby authorised to acquire for the Hauraki Plains East Water-supply District and Special-rating Area the existing water main in the Pekapeka Road Water-supply District at the valuation thereof---namely, the sum of 500 pounds, and to convert such water main to the Hauraki Plains East water-supply system.

    *   (b) in payment and out of revenue moneys only of the interest and the sinking fund instalments of the said Pekapeka Road Water-supply Loan of 2,000 pounds as from 31 March 1938:
    
    *   (c) out of loan or other moneys, to pay at the maturity of the said Pekapeka Road Water-supply Loan the capital thereof to the extent to which the accumulated sinking fund therefor shall or may be insufficient to liquidate such loan.
    
    (3) The Pekapeka Road Water-supply District is hereby abolished as from the date of the passing of this Act, but the Pekapeka Water-supply Special-rating Area and the special rate or rates constituting the security for the said loan shall remain in full force and effect until such loan shall have been fully redeemed.

    And whereas such liabilities include a liability to the State Advances Corporation of New Zealand in respect of a loan to the Board together with arrears of interest and sinking fund on the loan, and also a liability to the Lower Mangapiko Drainage Board pursuant to [section 77][65] of the Reserves and other Lands Disposal and Public Bodies Empowering Act 1924, to pay that Board seven-fortieths of the annual instalments of interest and sinking fund on a loan raised by the said Lower Mangapiko Drainage Board for the purpose of executing certain works on the Mangapiko Stream and now owing to the State Advances Corporation:
    
    And whereas the Council is desirous, in pursuance of the Local Authorities Interest Reduction and Loans Conversion Act 1932--33, of issuing new securities in conversion of the existing securities issued by the Board in respect of the said loan owing to the State Advances Corporation of New Zealand, and of compounding the arrears of interest now owing in respect of the said existing securities and including such arrears of interest in the principal sum secured by such new securities and also of assuming liability direct to the State Advances Corporation of New Zealand instead of to the Lower Mangapiko Drainage Board for seven-fortieths of the principal and interest due on the said loan raised by the said Lower Mangapiko Drainage Board and now owing to the State Advances Corporation of New Zealand:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    (1) The Council may, in issuing new securities in conversion of the existing securities above referred to, with the consent of the holder of such securities compound the arrears of interest owing in respect of such existing securities and include such arrears in the principal sum secured by such new securities.

    (3) The Council may in each year during the currency of the new securities to be issued under this section pay out of the General Fund of the county not more than one-half of the annual instalments of interest and principal payable in respect of the new securities.
    
    (4) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the [Land Drainage Act 1908][66], the Counties Act 1920, or in any other Act, the Council may make and levy the special conversion rate pledged in respect of the new securities mentioned in subsection (1) on a uniform scale on all rateable property within the area comprised in the Tuatuamoana Drainage District immediately prior to the abolition of that district.
