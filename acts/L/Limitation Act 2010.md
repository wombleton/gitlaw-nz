##### 21 Claim to recover land (based on adverse possession)
    
*   (1) It is a defence to a claim to recover land if the defendant proves that the date on which the claim is filed is at least---
        
    *   (a) 60 years after the date on which the claim accrued to the claimant or to some other person through whom the claimant claims, if the claimant is, or is a person claiming through, the Crown; and
    
    *   (b) 12 years after the date on which the claim accrued to the claimant or to some other person through whom the claimant claims, if the claimant is not, and is not a person claiming through, the Crown.
    
    (2) No claim to recover land accrues under this Act unless and until the land is in the possession (in this section called _adverse possession_) of a person in whose favour the period in subsection (1)(a) or (b) can run.
    
    (3) For the purposes of this section, 1 or more joint tenants or tenants in common of any land can take adverse possession of the land as against the other tenant or tenants.

##### 22 When claims accrue: current interests in land
    
*   (1) A claim to recover land is deemed to have accrued on the date of the discontinuance or dispossession if the claimant, or a person through whom the claimant claims,---
        
    *   (a) has been in possession of the land; and
    
    *   (b) has, while entitled to the land, discontinued possession, or been dispossessed, of the land.

    *   (a) in possession of the land on the date he or she died; or
    
    *   (b) in the case of a rentcharge created by will or taking effect on the deceased's death, in possession of the land charged, and was the last person entitled to the land to be in possession of that land.
    
    Compare: 1950 No 65 [s 8][130]

##### 23 When claims accrue: future interests in land
    
*   (1) A claim to recover land is, unless this section provides otherwise, deemed to have accrued on the date on which the estate or interest claimed fell into possession (by the determination of the preceding estate or interest or otherwise) if---
        
    *   (a) that estate or interest was one in reversion or remainder, or some other future estate or interest; and
    
    *   (b) no person has taken possession of the land by virtue of that estate or interest.
    
    (2) If the person entitled to the preceding estate or interest was not in possession of the land on the date of the determination of that estate or interest, no relief may be granted in respect of a claim made by the person entitled to the succeeding estate or interest---
        
    *   (a) after 60 years from the date on which the claim accrued to the Crown if the Crown is entitled to the succeeding estate or interest; or
    
    *   (b) in any other case, after whichever expires last of the following periods:
            
        *   (i) 12 years from the date on which the claim accrued to the person entitled to the preceding estate or interest:

    (3) Subsections (1) and (2) apply if the preceding estate or interest is a leasehold interest if, and only if, that estate or interest is determinable with life or lives, or with the end of a determinable life interest.
    
    (4) If a person (_A_) is entitled to an estate or interest in land in possession and, while so entitled, is also entitled to a future estate or interest in that land, and this Act prevents relief from being granted in respect of A's claim to recover the estate or interest in possession, no relief may be granted in respect of a claim made by A, or by any person claiming through A, in respect of the future estate or interest, unless in the meantime possession of the land has been recovered by a person entitled to an intermediate estate or interest.

*   (1) This Act applies to equitable interests in land, including interests in the proceeds of the sale of land held on trust for sale, in the same way as it applies to legal estates.
    
    (2) Accordingly a claim to recover the land is, for the purposes only of this Act, deemed to accrue to a person entitled in possession to an equitable interest of that kind in the same way and circumstances and on the same date as it would accrue if the person's interest were a legal estate in the land.
    
    (3) If land is held by a trustee (including one who is also tenant for life) on trust, including a trust for sale, and the period in [section 21(1)(a) or (b)][24] for the trustee to make a claim to recover the land has expired, the estate of the trustee is extinguished only if, and when, the claim to recover the land of every person entitled to a beneficial interest in the land or in the proceeds of sale has accrued and may be the subject of a defence under section 21\.
    
    (4) If land held on trust for sale is in the possession of a person entitled to a beneficial interest in the land or in the proceeds of sale, not being a person solely and absolutely entitled to the land or the proceeds, no claim to recover the land is for the purposes of this Act deemed to accrue during that possession to a person in whom the land is vested as tenant for life, person having the powers of a tenant for life, or trustee, or to any person entitled to a beneficial interest in the land or the proceeds.

    *   (b) made by, or by a person claiming through, the mortgagor.

    Compare: 1950 No 65 [s 17][135]

##### 27 Extinguishment of owner's title after specified period

    (2) When [section 301][113] of the Companies Act 1993 applies, in accordance with [section 55][116] of the Corporations (Investigation and Management) Act 1989 or [section 139][117] of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1989, to a corporation or a registered bank subject to statutory management, the date in subsection (1)(d) must be read as the date on which the corporation or bank was declared to be subject to statutory management.

## Part 4  
General provisions

#### Arbitrations, special defences, and contracting out

##### 39 Application of limitation enactments to arbitrations
    
*   (1) _Arbitration_ means an arbitration under an arbitration agreement or under an enactment, and _limitation enactments_ means this Act and any other enactment relating to the limitation of claims.
    
    (2) Limitation enactments apply to claims made in arbitrations as they apply to claims made in a civil proceeding commenced in a specified court or tribunal.
    
    (3) An arbitration must, for the purposes of a limitation enactment, be treated as being commenced in the same manner as provided in [Article 21][147] of Schedule 1 of the Arbitration Act 1996\.
    
    (4) If the High Court orders that an award be set aside, it may also order that the period between the commencement of the arbitration and the date of the setting aside order must be excluded in computing the time prescribed by a limitation enactment for the commencement of civil proceedings (including arbitration) with respect to the dispute referred.
    
    Compare: 1950 No 65 [s 29][148]

##### 40 Other enactments may displace or affect defences
    
*   (1) A defence under [Part 2][11] or [3][20] does not apply to a claim if an enactment other than this Act---
        
    *   (a) prescribes for the claim a limitation period or any other kind of limitation defence; or
    
    *   (b) provides for the determination or fixing of the time before which, or period within which, the claim must be made.
    
    (2) However, this section does not limit or affect the operation of enactments other than this Act that---
        
    *   (a) do what is specified in subsection (1) but apply to a claim not instead of, but as well as, this Act; or
    
    *   (b) alter, extend, limit, or prevent this Act's application or operation.
    
    Compare: 1950 No 65 [s 33(1)][105]

##### 41 Contracting out of defences
    
*   No provision of this Act makes ineffective, or prevents the enforcement of, an agreement that conflicts or is inconsistent with, or that modifies or prevents some or all of the operation or effects of, a defence under this Act.

#### Pleading, and effect of establishing, defences

##### 42 Defendant not excused from pleading defence
    
*   No provision of this Act excuses the defendant from complying with a rule of court or other law requiring the defendant to plead a defence under this Act before trying to establish it.

##### 43 Established defence bars relief, not underlying right
    
*   If the defendant establishes a defence under this Act against a claim, and no order under [section 17][18], [35(5)][39], [36(4)][40], or [50][61] applies to the claim,---
        
    *   (a) a court or tribunal must not grant the relief sought by the claim; but
    
    *   (b) the establishment by the defendant of the defence does not extinguish, as against the defendant or any other person, any entitlement, interest, right, or title of the claimant on which the claim is based.
    
    

#### Exceptions or modifications to periods and start dates

##### 44 Minority
    
*   If the claimant proves that, at the close of the start date of a claim's primary period, longstop period, or [Part 3][20] period the claimant was younger than 18 years old, the period does not start to run until the day after the date on which the claimant becomes 18 years of age.

##### 45 Incapacity
    
*   (1) This section applies to a claimant who proves either or both of the following:
        
    *   (a) that the claimant was incapacitated at the close of the start date of a claim's primary period, longstop period, or [Part 3][20] period:
    
    *   (b) that the claimant became incapacitated during a claim's primary period, longstop period, or [Part 3][20] period.
    
    (2) If this section applies to a claimant, the specified court or tribunal may, if it thinks it just to do so on an application made to it (before or after the end of the period) for the purpose, order that a claim's primary period, longstop period, or [Part 3][20] period is extended to the close of a date stated in the order.
    
    (3) In determining whether to make an order under this section, the specified court or tribunal must take into account---
        
    *   (a) whether, while the claimant was incapacitated, a litigation guardian or other authorised representative managed the claimant's affairs with respect to the act or omission on which the claim is based; and
    
    *   (b) any steps taken by the litigation guardian or other authorised representative to manage those affairs; and
    
    *   (c) any effects or likely effects of the delay on---
            
        *   (i) the defendant's ability to defend the claim; and
        
        *   (ii) the cogency of the evidence offered, or likely to be offered, by the claimant or the defendant; and
        
        
    
    *   (d) the defendant's conduct on and after the date of the act or omission on which the claim is based, including the extent to which the defendant responded to requests for information or inspection that were reasonably made by or on behalf of the claimant in order to discover facts that were, or might be, relevant to the claim; and
    
    *   (e) the extent to which prompt and reasonable steps were taken by or on behalf of the claimant to make the claim after the claimant became aware that the claimant was entitled to do so; and
    
    *   (f) any steps taken by or on behalf of the claimant to obtain relevant medical, legal, or other expert advice, and the nature of any relevant expert advice received by or on behalf of the claimant; and
    
    *   (g) any other matters it considers relevant.
    
    

##### 46 Incapacitated and related terms defined
    
*   In [section 45][55] and this section,---
    
    _incapacitated_ means that a claimant or a personal representative is not capable of understanding the issues on which his or her decision would be required as a litigant conducting proceedings with respect to the act or omission on which the claim is based, or is unable to give sufficient instructions to issue, defend, or compromise proceedings of that kind, because of all or any of the following:
        
    *   (a) temporary or permanent physical, intellectual, or mental impairment:
    
    *   (b) lawful or unlawful detention:

    *   (b) a mental disorder as defined in [section 2(1)][151] of the Mental Health (Compulsory Assessment and Treatment) Act 1992
    
    _personal representative_ means an executor, administrator, or trustee of the estate of an individual who has died.

##### 47 Acknowledgment or part payment
    
*   (1) This section applies if the claimant proves that, after the start date of a claim's primary period, longstop period, or [Part 3][20] period, the defendant---
        
    *   (a) acknowledged to the claimant in writing a liability to, or the right or title of, the claimant; or
    
    *   (b) made a payment to the claimant in respect of a liability to, or the right or title of, the claimant.
    
    (2) If this section applies, the claimant is deemed for the purposes only of this Act to have a fresh claim on the day after the date, or the latest of the dates, on which an acknowledgment or part payment was given or made.
    
    (3) An acknowledgment or part payment of the kind specified in subsection (1)---
        
    *   (a) is binding on the defendant's successors; and
    
    *   (b) may be given or made by the defendant or an agent of the defendant and to the claimant or an agent of the claimant.
    
    (4) Payment or part payment of interest by the defendant must be treated for the purposes of this section as an acknowledgment by the defendant to the claimant in writing of the defendant's liability to pay the claimant both that interest and the principal in respect of which it is paid.
    
    Compare: 1950 No 65 [ss 25--27][152]

##### 48 Fraud
    
*   (1) A claim's longstop period or [Part 3][20] period does not apply to the claim if the claimant proves that, because of fraud by or on behalf of the defendant, at the close of the start date of that period the claimant neither knew nor ought reasonably to have known all or any of the following facts:
        
    *   (a) the fact that the act or omission on which the claim is based had occurred:
    
    *   (b) the fact that the act or omission on which the claim is based was attributable (wholly or in part) to, or involved, the defendant:
    
    *   (c) if the defendant's liability or alleged liability is dependent on the claimant suffering damage or loss, the fact that the claimant had suffered damage or loss:
    
    *   (d) if the defendant's liability or alleged liability is dependent on the claimant not having consented to the act or omission on which the claim is based, the fact that the claimant did not consent to that act or omission:
    
    *   (e) if the defendant's liability or alleged liability is dependent on the act or omission on which the claim is based having been induced by fraud or, as the case may be, by a mistaken belief, the fact that the act or omission on which the claim is based is one that was induced by fraud or, as the case may be, by a mistaken belief.
    
    (2) It is a defence to a claim whose [Part 3][20] period is disapplied by subsection (1), and that does not have a late knowledge period, if the defendant proves that the date on which the claim is filed is at least 3 years after the date on which the claimant gained knowledge (or, if earlier, the date on which the claimant ought reasonably to have gained knowledge) of all of the facts specified in subsection (1)(a) to (e).
    
    (3) The fact that a claimant did not know (or had not gained knowledge), nor ought reasonably to have known (or to have gained knowledge), of a particular fact may be attributable to causes that are or include fraud or a mistake of fact or law (other than a mistake of law as to the effect of this Act).
    
    (4) [Sections 44][54] to [47][57] apply to the 3-year period prescribed for a claim by subsection (2) of this section as if that period were a [Part 3][20] period.
    
    Compare: 1950 No 65 [ss 4(6B), (7)][94], [21(1)(a)][121], [28][153]

##### 49 Trust property possessed or converted by trustee
    
*   (1) A claim's longstop period or [Part 3][20] period does not apply to the claim if it is one by a beneficiary of a trust to recover from the trustee either or both of the following:
        
    *   (a) trust property, the proceeds of trust property, or both in the trustee's possession:
    
    *   (b) trust property, the proceeds of trust property, or both previously received by the trustee and converted to the trustee's use.
    
    (2) It is a defence to a claim whose [Part 3][20] period is disapplied by subsection (1), and that does not have a late knowledge period, if the defendant proves that the date on which the claim is filed is at least 3 years after the date on which the claimant gained knowledge (or, if earlier, the date on which the claimant ought reasonably to have gained knowledge) of the trustee's breach of the trust.
    
    (3) [Sections 44][54] to [47][57] apply to the 3-year period prescribed for a claim by subsection (2) of this section as if that period were a [Part 3][20] period.
    
    Compare: 1950 No 65 [s 21(1)(b)][121]

#### Ancillary claims

##### 50 Discretion to allow relief for ancillary claim when allowed for original claim
    
*   (1) This section applies to an ancillary claim made in a civil proceeding commenced in a specified court or tribunal if, and only if,---
        
    *   (a) relief may be granted in respect of the original claim, because no defence under [Part 2][11] or [3][20] has been or could be established against it, or because of an order under [section 17][18], [35(5)][39], or [36(4)][40]; but
    
    *   (b) relief cannot be granted in respect of the ancillary claim because a defence under Part 2 or 3 has been or could be established against it, and because no order under [section 17][18], [35(5)][39], or [36(4)][40] allows a court or tribunal to grant monetary relief in respect of it.
    
    (2) The specified court or tribunal may, if it thinks it just to do so on an application made to it for the purpose, order that relief may be granted in respect of the ancillary claim as if no defence under [Part 2][11] or [3][20] applies to it.
    
    (3) The application for the order must be made before the specified court or tribunal has decided whether the defendant has established a defence under [Part 2][11] or [3][20] against the ancillary claim.

#### Interest in respect of judgment debts

##### 51 Recovery restricted to 6 years from date interest due

##### 53 Personal representative making or defending claim on behalf of deceased's estate
    
*   (1) _Personal representative_, in this section and for an individual who has died (the _deceased_), means a person who is the executor, administrator, or trustee of, and is making or defending a claim on behalf of, the deceased's estate.
    
    (2) A personal representative may take advantage of 1 or more exceptions or modifications set out in this Act that would have been available to the deceased, except that a period that under [section 44][54] does not start to run because of the claimant's minority is treated as starting at the time of the deceased's death.
    
    (3) A personal representative may take advantage of any late knowledge period that the deceased could have sought to use had he or she not died and, if the personal representative does so, [section 14][15] applies as if facts that the claimant knew, or ought to have known, include any facts that the personal representative gained knowledge of, or ought to have gained knowledge of, after the time of the deceased's death.
    
    (4) [Section 45][55] applies to any incapacity of the personal representative after the time of the deceased's death in the same way as it applies to any incapacity of the deceased before that time.
    
    (5) A personal representative may take advantage of any discretion in [section 17][18], [35][39], [36][40], or [50][61] that the deceased could have sought to use had he or she not died.

##### 54 Trust beneficiaries cannot derive benefit indirectly
    
*   No beneficiary of a trust (**A**) as against whom there would under this Act be an effective defence may derive any greater or other benefit from a judgment or order obtained by any other beneficiary of the trust (**B**) than A could have obtained if---
        
    *   (a) A had made himself, herself, or itself a claim that is the same in substance as the claim made by B; and
    
    *   (b) this Act had been pleaded in defence to the claim made by A.
    
    Compare: 1950 No 65 [s 21(3)][121]

#### Application of limitation law of  
foreign countries

##### 55 How limitation law of foreign countries applied in civil proceedings and arbitrations
    
*   (1) This section applies to a civil proceeding before a New Zealand court or tribunal, or to an arbitration, whenever the substantive law of a foreign country is to be applied in that proceeding or arbitration.
    
    (2) The limitation law of that foreign country is part of the substantive law of that country and must be applied accordingly in that proceeding or arbitration.
    
    (3) A New Zealand court or tribunal or arbitrator exercising, under subsection (2), a discretion under the limitation law of a foreign country must, so far as practicable, exercise it in the manner in which it is exercised in that foreign country.
    
    (4) If, under subsection (2), the limitation law of a foreign country must be applied in a proceeding or arbitration, the limitation law of New Zealand (other than this section) must not be applied in that proceeding or arbitration.
    
    (5) Subsection (4) does not apply insofar as the matter being determined in that proceeding or arbitration is one in the determination of which both the law of New Zealand and the law of a foreign country fall to be taken into account.
    
    Compare: 1950 No 65 [ss 28B][154], [28C][155]; Choice of Law (Limitation Periods) Act 1993 ss 5, 6 (NSW); Foreign Limitation Periods Act 1984 s 1(1)(b), (2) (UK)

##### 56 Public policy exception for limitation law of foreign countries other than Australia
    
*   (1) [Section 55][69] does not apply to the extent that its application would conflict (whether under subsection (2) or otherwise) with public policy.
    
    (2) A conflict with public policy exists for the purposes of subsection (1) when, and insofar as, the application of [section 55][69] would cause undue hardship to a person who is, or might be made, a party to the proceeding or arbitration.
    
    (3) Nothing in this section applies in respect of any limitation law that is, or has been, in force in Australia.
    
    Compare: Foreign Limitation Periods Act 1984 s 2(1), (2) (UK)

    (3) Nothing in this section prevents any provision of the [Limitation Act 1950][156] as in force at the time of its repeal from being applied, after 31 December 2010, and by analogy, to any claim for equitable relief---
        
    *   (a) based on an act or omission before 1 January 2011; and
    
    *   (b) to which the [Limitation Act 1950][156] immediately before its repeal did not apply directly.
