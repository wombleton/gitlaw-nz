    *   (a) the council---
            
        *   (i) forms a new road in the district; or

    *   (b) for that purpose the council takes or purchases or otherwise acquires any part of any land and the other part of that land will have access or frontage to that road; and
    
    *   (c) by reason of the formation or widening of the road the value of the remaining part of the land of the owner whose land was taken or purchased or acquired is increased by an amount that exceeds the amount of compensation payable to him, in accordance with the [Public Works Act 1981][1829], in respect of his land so taken or purchased or acquired,---
    
    the owner shall pay the amount of that excess to the council by way of betterment to the remaining part of his land.
    
    (2) Where an existing road is widened and land from only one side of the road is taken or purchased or otherwise acquired for that purpose, every owner of land with a frontage to the other side of the road shall, if so required by the council, pay to the council on account of betterment such sum of money as represents the increased value thereby given, or likely to be given, to his land. Where only part or parts of a road are widened, only those owners of land with frontages directly opposite the part or parts being widened may be required to pay betterment pursuant to this subsection.
    
    (3) Any claim for payment of betterment under subsection (1) or subsection (2) shall be made within 1 year from the execution of the work out of which it arose, and shall be made in form 1 in [Schedule 12][1800]. The amount to be paid to the council shall be ascertained in the manner provided by the [Public Works Act 1981][1829], or in a manner as near thereto as in the opinion of the Land Valuation Tribunal the circumstances of each claim will admit.
    
    (4) Any or all claims arising out of the widening of any road or part thereof may, with the consent in writing of all parties, be heard and determined together, and the Land Valuation Tribunal shall have power, on the application of any party, to order that all or any claims under this section in respect of land in which several persons have interest shall be heard and determined together and to apportion the amount awarded on account of betterment and the costs of proceedings against the several persons, in such proportions and in such manner as it thinks fit.
    
    (5) Any person liable may, if he so desires, pay the amount awarded to be payable by him, with interest at a rate per annum as fixed by the council, by equal half-yearly instalments extending over a period of 20  years or less, in which case he shall---
        
    *   (a) within 14 days after the date of the award, give notice in writing to the principal administrative officer of the council of the period over which he intends to extend payment; and
    
    *   (b) within 1 month after the date of the award, execute and deliver to the principal administrative officer a memorandum of charge, in form 2 in [Schedule 12][1800], upon the estate or interest forming the subject of the charge against him, and pay the costs of the preparation and completion of that memorandum;---
    
    and thereupon the respondent shall have the right to pay that amount by instalments as set forth in the notice and memorandum of charge as aforesaid.
    
    (6) \[Repealed\]
    
    (7) The memorandum of charge shall, when registered, bind the property therein described, and operate as a first charge upon the estate or interest therein of the respondent, and rank in priority to all estates, encumbrances, and interests created by him or any of his predecessors in title.
    
    (8) Any such charge may be registered without fee in the Land Registry Office or in the Deeds Register Office of the land registration district wherein the land affected thereby is situate.
    
    (9) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any such charge, the council shall accept payment of the whole of the unpaid instalments secured by any such memorandum of charge at any time when the same is tendered, and for the purpose of any such tender interest shall be calculated and paid up to and including the day of tender.
    
    (10) A receipt expressed to be in full for all money secured by any such memorandum, signed by the principal administrative officer and endorsed on the memorandum, shall vacate the charge.
    
    (11) Money received by the council under this section as betterment shall be credited against the cost of the formation or widening of the road or part thereof which includes the acquisition of the land required for the work and the formation, sealing, kerbing, and channelling. Where the money received is more than sufficient to meet the cost of the work, the amount of the excess shall be applied in respect of the widening or formation of any other road within the district.
