An Act to give effect in this Colony to the Alteration of the Name of ""The Liverpool and London Fire and Life Insurance Company,"" and to enable ""The Liverpool and London and Globe Insurance Company"" to sue and be sued in the Name of the Company, and for other Purposes connected therewith.
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    WHEREAS in the year one thousand eight hundred and thirty-six a company or association was established in England, by the name of ""The Liverpool Fire and Life Insurance Company,"" for the purposes of making and effecting insurances on houses, warehouses, and buildings, shipping in port, goods, wares, and merchandise, farming stock, utensils, and property of all descriptions against loss or damage by fire, insurances on lives and survivorships, the sale and purchase of annuities, reversions, and contingent interests, and the endowment of children, and generally to carry on the business usually called or known as fire and life insurance and all matters connected therewith; and upon the establishment of the said company or association a deed of settlement was made dated the twenty-first day of May, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-six:
    
    And whereas, by an Act of the Imperial Parliament passed in the eleventh year of the reign of her present Majesty intituled ""An Act to change the Name of "'The Liverpool Fire Insurance Company'" and for other Purposes relating thereto"", the name of the said Company was changed to ""The Liverpool and London Fire and Life Insurance Company,"" and a supplement deed of settlement was made by the said Company dated the twenty-eighth day of February, one thousand eight hundred and fifty-one:
    
    And whereas, by virtue of the powers in that behalf given by the said supplementary deed of settlement to the Board of Directors for the time being of the said Company, a local Board of Directors of the said Company was, in the year one thousand eight hundred and fifty-three, duly appointed in the City of Sydney, in the Colony of New South Wales, for carrying on and managing in Australia, including New Zealand and Tasmania, the business of the said Company and all matters connected therewith, and for other purposes in connection with the affairs of the said Company:
    
    And whereas the said Company has for many years carried on and still continues to carry on such business in New Zealand under the direction of the said local Board in the name of ""The Liverpool and London and Globe Insurance Company:""
    
    And whereas, by an Act of the Imperial Parliament passed in the twenty-seventh and twenty-eighth years of the reign of her present Majesty, intituled ""An Act to confirm an Agreement for the Amalgamation of the Globe Insurance Company with the Liverpool and London Fire and Life Insurance Company, and to alter the Name of the last-mentioned Company, and for other Purposes,"" the name and style of the said Company was changed into and became ""The Liverpool and London and Globe Insurance Company:"" And whereas it is expedient to enable the said Liverpool and London and Globe Insurance Company to sue and be sued in this colony, and to give effect in this colony to the said change of name of the said Company, and to remove all doubts as to the effect of the said change of name upon the existing contracts and engagements of the said Company in this colony:
