    *   (a) The name of the intended institution:
    
    *   (b) Its purposes:
    
    *   (c) The amount of money or money's worth subscribed by them respectively or held by them for the use thereof:

    Compare: 1875 No 88 s 2
    
    The expression ""$40"" was substituted for the words ""twenty pounds"" by section [7][32] of the Decimal Currency Act 1964\.

##### 15 Duplicate declaration, how disposed of
    
*   (1) One duplicate of such declaration shall be filed in the office of the Registrar of the High Court nearest to the site of the intended institution by one of the subscribing parties, who shall, before such Registrar, acknowledge the execution thereof by himself, and declare the same to have been executed by the other parties thereto or by their attorneys.
    
    (2) The Registrar shall keep the duplicate so filed, and deliver the other to the person who filed it, with a certificate of the same having been so filed and of the execution having been attested before him; and such duplicate, or any copy thereof certified by such Registrar, shall be _prima facie_ evidence of the facts alleged in such declaration and certificate.
