    And whereas the Council by resolution made on 7 April 1938 resolved to raise the said loan and, pursuant to such resolution, arranged to raise the said loan by instalments as required:
    
    And whereas the authority conferred by the said Order in Council expired on 19 August 1938:
    
    And whereas by Order in Council made on 13 September 1939 a fresh consent was issued authorising the Council to raise the balance then outstanding:
    
    And whereas after 19 August 1938 but before 13 September 1939 the Council received instalments amounting to 10,900 pounds in respect of the said loan:
    
    And whereas it appears that the Council had no authority to receive the said instalments amounting to 10,900 pounds, and it is desirable that the raising of such amount of 10,900 pounds by the Council as aforesaid should be validated:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    The action of the Council in raising the said sum of 10,900 pounds of the Awatere Water-supply Loan, 1936 is hereby validated, and the said moneys shall be deemed to have been lawfully borrowed and the securities given in respect thereof to have been lawfully issued.

    And whereas, owing to necessary alterations in the said scheme and to increased costs in connection therewith, it has been found necessary to raise further moneys for the completion of the supply scheme and for paying incidental expenses in connection therewith, and it is desirable that the Council be authorised to raise such amount without taking a poll of ratepayers:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    (1) The Council is hereby authorised to raise a loan of 7,000 pounds to be known as the Awatere Water-supply Loan, 1940, by way of special loan under the Local Bodies' Loans Act 1926, by special order and without taking the steps prescribed by sections 9 to 13 of that Act, for the purpose of the completion of the Awatere water supply scheme aforesaid and for paying the balance of the costs thereof and incidental expenses in connection therewith, such loan to be in substitution for the supplementary loan which the Council is authorised to raise under subsection (1) of section 19 of the said Act.

    And whereas, by reason of reductions of the valuations of the rateable property within such riding, the rates which can lawfully be levied on land in that riding do not produce a greater sum than is required for essential maintenance works within the said riding, with the consequence that the separate account of the said riding is in debit:
    
    And whereas it is deemed expedient, and the Waitotara County Council (hereinafter called the **Council**) has approved, that such exceptional expenditure should be apportioned among the separate accounts of certain other ridings as well as the said Tokomaru Riding as hereinafter provided, and that rates for the year ending on 31 March 1941 should be made and levied having regard to the apportionment of such expenditure:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:

    (2) The Council is hereby further authorised to include in its estimates of expenditure for the year ending on 31 March 1941, as an amount required to cover the debit balance of the separate account of the Tokomaru Riding, the sum of 700 pounds in respect of the Brunswick-Westmere Riding, the sum of 911 pounds in respect of the Waitotara Riding, and the sum of 9 pounds in respect of the Mosston Riding; and no rate made and levied by the Council for the year ending on 31 March 1941 shall be invalidated on the ground that such rate was made and levied on the basis of such estimates of expenditure.

    And whereas the Council on 23 July 1936 took a poll of the ratepayers in the said district on a proposal to borrow the sum of 26,000 pounds for the purpose of constructing a high pressure water supply for the said Awatere Water-supply Special-rating Area:
    
    And whereas by Order in Council dated 23 April 1937 and made under section 182 of the Counties Act 1920 the provisions relating to water supply contained in the Municipal Corporations Act 1933 were made to apply to the county:
    
    And whereas doubts have arisen as to the validity of the said poll and the special rate made and levied as security for the said loan of 26,000 pounds:
    
    And whereas it is desirable that such doubts should be resolved:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Local Legislation Act 1940\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 July 2003, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][60] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][61] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][62] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][63] and [17E][64] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
