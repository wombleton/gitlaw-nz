#### Decision making

##### 14 General scheme
    
*   (1) This section sets out the general scheme of [sections 14 to 21][22]. These are the provisions of this Act that set out how the Auckland Council, in its capacity as a local authority, makes its decisions. This section is by way of explanation only and does not limit or affect the other provisions of this Act or any other enactment.
    
    (2) Both the governing body and the local boards are responsible and democratically accountable for the decision making of the Auckland Council. Whether responsibility for making any particular decision rests with the governing body or 1 or more or all of the local boards depends on the nature of the decision being made.
    
    (3) [Section 15][23] sets out the classes of decisions that the governing body must make. [Section 16][24] sets out the classes of decisions that local boards must make. Both sections include a class of decisions in respect of non-regulatory activities of the Council. The governing body allocates responsibility for any particular decision in this class of decisions to either itself or the local boards by applying the principles set out in [section 17][25]. The results of the allocation must then be set out in the LTP and annual plans of the Council so that the people of Auckland, and any other persons, can easily determine whether the governing body or a local board is responsible for any particular decision of the Council.
    
    (4) To determine local wishes and priorities in relation to the non-regulatory activities for which a local board is allocated responsibility, the board must consult its communities. The local board does this by preparing a local board plan under [section 20][31]. This plan is used as a basis for the board to develop an annual local board agreement with the governing body under [section 21][32] in which the nature, levels, and funding of the activities are set out.
    
    Section 14(2): amended, on 8 August 2014, by [section 77][178] of the Local Government Act 2002 Amendment Act 2014 (2014 No 55).
    
    Section 14(3): amended, on 27 November 2010, by [section 50][163] of the Local Government Act 2002 Amendment Act 2010 (2010 No 124).

##### 15 Decision-making responsibilities of governing body
    
*   (1) The governing body is responsible and democratically accountable for---

    *   (e) the agreement reached with each local board (as set out in each local board agreement) in respect of local activities for the local board areas.
    
    (2) Before making a decision described in subsection (1)(a) to (d), the governing body must---
        
    *   (a) comply with any requirements of this Act; and
    
    *   (b) comply with any requirements of the [Local Government Act 2002][157] and any other enactment; and
    
    *   (c) consider any views and preferences expressed by a local board, if the decision affects or may affect the responsibilities or operation of the local board or the well-being of communities within its local board area.
    
    Section 15(1)(b): replaced, on 8 August 2014, by [section 77][178] of the Local Government Act 2002 Amendment Act 2014 (2014 No 55).

    *   (b) identifying and communicating the interests and preferences of the people in its local board area in relation to the content of the strategies, policies, plans, and bylaws of the Auckland Council; and
    
    *   (c) identifying and developing bylaws specifically for its local board area, and proposing them to the governing body under [section 24][36]; and
    
    *   (d) the agreement reached with the governing body (as set out in the local board agreement) in respect of local activities for its local board area.
    
    (2) In carrying out the responsibilities described in this section, a local board must comply with the requirements of [sections 76 to 82][191] of the Local Government Act 2002 as if every reference in those sections to a local authority were a reference to a local board.
    
    (3) In carrying out the responsibilities described in this section, a local board should collaborate and co-operate with 1 or more other local boards in the situations where the interests and preferences of communities within each local board area will be better served by doing so.
    
    Section 16(3): added, on 1 November 2010, by [section 17][192] of the Local Government (Auckland Council) Amendment Act 2010 (2010 No 36).

    (2) The principles are---
        
    *   (a) decision-making responsibility for a non-regulatory activity of the Auckland Council should be exercised by its local boards unless paragraph (b) applies:
    
    *   (b) decision-making responsibility for a non-regulatory activity of the Auckland Council should be exercised by its governing body if the nature of the activity is such that decision making on an Auckland-wide basis will better promote the well-being of the communities across Auckland because---
            
        *   (i) the impact of the decision will extend beyond a single local board area; or
        
        *   (ii) effective decision making will require alignment or integration with other decisions that are the responsibility of the governing body; or
        
        *   (iii) the benefits of a consistent or co-ordinated approach across Auckland will outweigh the benefits of reflecting the diverse needs and preferences of the communities within each local board area.
