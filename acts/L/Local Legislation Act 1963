    And whereas a public hall known as the Glenroy Hall (in this section referred to as the **hall**) is built upon the land:
    
    And whereas by a Declaration of Trust dated 20 April 1928, the trustees declared that they did and should hold the hall as a public hall for the use and benefit of the residents of the Glenroy district:
    
    And whereas all of the trustees are deceased and the hall has for some years been administered by a committee known as the Glenroy Hall Committee (in this section referred to as the **Committee**):
    
    And whereas at a public meeting of residents of the Glenroy district called by public notice and held on 12 November 1962, it was resolved that the Committee take the necessary action to enable the hall and the land to be vested in the Selwyn County Council:

    And whereas Her Majesty the Queen has taken certain parts of the said land (in this section referred to as the **said land**) for education purposes in connection with the University of Auckland:
    
    And whereas it is expedient that the Corporation should be empowered to deal with and apply the proceeds of the compensation payable in respect of the taking of the said land in the manner hereinafter provided: 
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    (1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Act or rule of law, the net proceeds of the money received by the Corporation by way of compensation for the taking of the said land shall be paid into the Corporation's Auckland Domain Trust Account, and shall be applied in or towards the cost of purchasing or otherwise acquiring land in the City of Auckland for the purposes expressed in the said Act or for the development or improvement of land now or hereafter vested in the Corporation for those purposes, or for investment in any investments for the time being authorised by law for the investment of trust funds (the said compensation money and investments arising under the provisions of this section being referred to as the **compensation fund**).
    
    (2) The Corporation shall hold any land purchased or acquired pursuant to the powers vested in it by this section for the purposes expressed in the said Act, and the Corporation shall have in respect of that land all such powers of leasing and disposition as it has under the provisions of the said Act, and also as it has in respect of its general or ordinary endowments, and in addition shall have the special powers set out in subsection (3).

    And whereas during the period that commenced on 1 January 1909, being the date of the commencement of the said Act, and ended with 16 July 1963, the Council, in the erroneous belief that it was a leasing authority within the meaning of the said Act, and in the purported exercise of its powers as such an authority, granted leases and renewals of leases: 
    
    And whereas doubts have arisen as to the validity of the leases and renewals of leases so granted by the Council during the said period: 
    
    And whereas it is desirable to remove those doubts:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    Notwithstanding anything contained in the Public Bodies Leases Act 1908 or any other Act, the Council shall be deemed to have been a leasing authority within the meaning of the Public Bodies Leases Act 1908, without any exceptions, restrictions, limitations, or conditions, during the period that commenced on 1 January 1909, and ended with 16 July 1963, and accordingly to have possessed during the said period all the powers conferred upon leasing authorities by that Act.

    And whereas after expending the amount of the loan the Council expended out of its District Fund Account the sum of 700 pounds in completion of the stormwater drainage works:
    
    And whereas the Local Authorities Loans Board has no authority to sanction the raising of a loan for the purpose of enabling the Council to refund the said sum of 700 pounds to its District Fund Account:
    
    And whereas it is desirable to authorise the Council to raise a special loan of 700 pounds for the purpose of recouping its District Fund Account in respect of the sum expended from that account as aforesaid:

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Local Legislation Act 1963\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 20 May 1999, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][63] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][64] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][65] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][66] and [17E][67] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
