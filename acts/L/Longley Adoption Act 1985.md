An Act to enable Ralph Arthur Longley and Emily Waimunga Longley to adopt Lorraine Janet Chapman and Leanne Gail Chapman
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    Whereas Ralph Arthur Longley and Emily Waimunga Longley were married at Whangarei on 20 January 1968:
    
    And whereas, at the time of their marriage, Emily Waimunga Longley had 2 children, namely Lorraine Janet Chapman and Leanne Gail Chapman and wanted the children to formally become part of the new family unit:
    
    And whereas accordingly, on 19 August 1970, the solicitors for Ralph Arthur Longley and Emily Waimunga Longley obtained an interim adoption order in the Magistrate's Court at Whangarei with respect to Lorraine Janet Chapman and Leanne Gail Chapman:
    
    And whereas due to the inadvertence of the said solicitors, no application for a final adoption order was made:
    
    And whereas that error was not discovered until 1983:
    
    And whereas, although the marriage of Ralph Arthur Longley and Emily Waimunga Longley has been dissolved, their relationship is good and they and the said children wish the adoption matter to be carried through:
    
    And whereas the said solicitors have advised Ralph Arthur Longley and Emily Waimunga Longley that it is no longer possible to obtain a final adoption order in respect of the interim order that was obtained:
    
    And whereas the said solicitors have also advised Ralph Arthur Longley and Emily Waimunga Longley that it is now not possible to make application for an adoption order at all because of the provisions of [sections 3][7] and [4][8] of the Adoption Act 1955 and that the only way of achieving the desired result is by the enactment of a private Act of Parliament:
    
    And whereas, because it is intended that Lorraine Janet Chapman and Leanne Gail Chapman should become the legally adoptive children of Ralph Arthur Longley and Emily Waimunga Longley, the change of their names by deed poll would not be satisfactory:
    
    And whereas the natural father of the children was not living with Emily Waimunga Longley when the children were born and has never shown any interest in the children:
    
    And whereas the purpose of this Act is to place each of them Ralph Arthur Longley, Emily Waimunga Longley, Lorraine Janet Chapman and Leanne Gail Chapman in the same position that they would have been had it not been for the inadvertence of their solicitors.

##### 1 Short Title
    
*   This Act may be cited as the Longley Adoption Act 1985\.

##### 2 Adoption
    
*   Notwithstanding any rule of law to the contrary, Lorraine Janet Chapman and Leanne Gail Chapman shall, from the date of commencement of this Act, be the legally adoptive children of Ralph Arthur Longley and Emily Waimunga Longley.

*   The Registrar of Births and Deaths shall issue new birth certificates for Lorraine Janet Chapman and Leanne Gail Chapman in the names of Lorraine Janet Longley and Leanne Gail Longley, respectively; and the word "adopted" shall not appear on such new birth certificates.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Longley Adoption Act 1985\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 29 March 1985, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][9] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][10] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][11] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][12] and [17E][13] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
