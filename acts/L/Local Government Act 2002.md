    *   (h) it is not in the public interest to assess the application.
    
    

##### 8 Community support

    *   (a) the Commission may use information that is reasonably available and does not have to (but may) make its own inquiries and conduct its own investigations:
    
    *   (b) the Commission does not need to determine whether the persons who support local government reorganisation are a majority of the persons in an affected area.
    
    (4) If the reorganisation application is accompanied by a petition,---
        
    *   (a) the chief executive officer of the Commission must refer the application to the electoral officers of the affected local authority or local authorities to confirm the names and addresses of electors who signed the petition; and
    
    *   (b) the electoral officers must advise the Commission of the number of qualified electors of each territorial authority district who---
            
        *   (i) were entitled to sign the petition; and
        
        *   (ii) have signed the petition.
        
        
    
    (5) If the Commission is not satisfied about community support as required by subclause (1), the Commission must---
        
    *   (a) decline the application without completing the assessment of it; or
    
    *   (b) require the applicant to provide further evidence of community support; or
    
    *   (c) undertake any other investigations it considers appropriate to determine community support for the application.
    
    

##### 9 Commission to seek alternative applications
    
*   (1) If the Commission is satisfied about community support, as required by [clause 8][1023], the Commission must give---
        
    *   (a) public notice; and
    
    *   (b) notice to---
            
        *   (i) the affected local authorities; and
        
        *   (ii) each local authority whose district or region adjoins the district or region of an affected local authority; and
        
        *   (iii) any other person, body, or group that the Commission considers should be notified.
        
        
    
    (2) A notice given under subclause (1) must---
        
    *   (a) state that a reorganisation application has been received by the Commission; and
    
    *   (b) describe the type of reorganisation proposed, the affected local authorities, and the extent of the affected area; and
    
    *   (c) indicate where further information about the application can be obtained; and
    
    *   (d) invite persons, bodies, and groups to submit, by a date specified in the notice, alternative applications in relation to the affected area; and
    
    *   (e) indicate that any alternative applications received after the date specified under paragraph (d) may be declined.
    
    (3) The date specified by the Commission under subclause (2)(d) for the receipt of alternative applications must not be earlier than 20 working days after the last notice given under subclause (1).

##### 10 Alternative applications
    
*   (1) An alternative application must comply with [clause 5][1020] as if it were a reorganisation application.
    
    (2) However, an alternative application is not required to comply with [clause 5(1)(f)][1020] in relation to a district of a territorial authority in which community support has been demonstrated in the reorganisation application received under [clause 3][1018].

##### 11 Commission to determine preferred option
    
*   (1) As soon as practicable after the deadline for the receipt of alternative applications, the Commission must, in accordance with this clause, determine its preferred option for local government of the affected area.
    
    (2) The Commission must first identify the reasonably practicable options for local government of the affected area.
    
    (3) In deciding the extent to which it identifies the reasonably practicable options, the Commission must have regard to---
        
    *   (a) the scale and scope of the changes proposed; and
    
    *   (b) the degree of community support for relevant applications that has been demonstrated to the Commission; and
    
    *   (c) the potential benefits of considering other options; and
    
    *   (d) the desirability of early certainty about local government arrangements for the affected area.
    
    (4) The reasonably practicable options---
        
    *   (a) must include the existing arrangements for local government; and
    
    *   (b) may include---
            
        *   (i) the proposals in the application made under [clause 3][1018]; or
        
        *   (ii) the proposals in an alternative application made under [clause 10][1025]; or
        
        *   (iii) options, other than those referred to in paragraph (a) and subparagraphs (i) and (ii), formulated by the Commission; or
        
        *   (iv) a combination of aspects derived from 2 or more of the options referred to in paragraph (a) and subparagraphs (i) to (iii).
        
        
    
    (5) The Commission must be satisfied that any local authority proposed to be established or changed under a reasonably practicable option will---
        
    *   (a) have the resources necessary to enable it to carry out effectively its responsibilities, duties, and powers; and
    
    *   (b) have a district or region that is appropriate for the efficient performance of its role as specified in [section 11][15]; and
    
    *   (c) contain within its district or region 1 or more communities of interest, but only if they are distinct communities of interest; and
    
    *   (d) in the case of a regional council or unitary authority, enable catchment-based flooding and water management issues to be dealt with effectively by the regional council or unitary authority.
    
    (6) For the purposes of subclause (5), the Commission must have regard to---
        
    *   (a) the area of impact of the responsibilities, duties, and powers of the local authorities concerned; and
    
    *   (b) the area of benefit of services provided; and
    
    *   (c) the likely effects on a local authority of the exclusion of any area from its district or region; and
    
    *   (d) any other matters that it considers appropriate.
    
    (7) In deciding whether any proposed changes are reasonably practicable, the Commission may---
        
    *   (a) request further information from applicants and affected local authorities; and
    
    *   (b) undertake any investigations and make any inquiries that the Commission considers appropriate.
    
    (8) If the Commission identifies 2 or more reasonably practicable options, the Commission must determine, having regard to the criteria in [clause 12][1027], its preferred option, being the option that best promotes good local government.

##### 12 Promotion of good local government
    
*   For the purposes of [clause 11(8)][1026], the Commission must be satisfied that its preferred option---
        
    *   (a) will best promote, in the affected area, the purpose of local government as specified in [section 10][13]; and
    
    *   (b) will facilitate, in the affected area, improved economic performance, which may (without limitation) include---
            
        *   (i) efficiencies and cost savings; and
        
        *   (ii) productivity improvements, both within the local authorities and for the businesses and households that interact with those local authorities; and
        
        *   (iii) simplified planning processes within and across the affected area through, for example, the integration of statutory plans or a reduction in the number of plans to be prepared or approved by a local authority.
        
        
    
    

##### 13 Procedure after preferred option determined
    
*   (1) After determining the preferred option under [clause 11][1026], the Commission must---
        
    *   (a) give notice of its determination and the reasons for it to---
            
        *   (i) each applicant; and
        
        *   (ii) every affected local authority; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) proceed under [clause 14][1031] to develop a draft reorganisation proposal to give effect to the preferred option.
    
    (2) However, subclause (1)(b) does not apply if the Commission's preferred option, under [clause 11][1026], is the existing arrangements for local government.

## Part 2  
Reorganisation proposals

### Subpart 1---Preparation of proposals

##### 14 Development of proposal
    
*   (1) This clause applies to a draft reorganisation proposal developed by the Commission to give effect to its preferred option (_draft proposal_).
    
    (2) A draft proposal must describe, for each affected local authority proposed to continue in existence,---
        
    *   (a) the type of local authority; and
    
    *   (b) the name of the district or region of the local authority; and
    
    *   (c) the nature and extent of any proposed changes to---
            
        *   (i) the boundaries of the district or region; and
        
        *   (ii) the representation arrangements of the local authority; and
        
        *   (iii) the extent to which the areas of interest of iwi and hapū are included in the district or region; and
        
        *   (iv) any communities and any community boards of the local authority; and
        
        
    
    *   (d) any other matters the Commission considers necessary or desirable.
    
    (3) A draft proposal must describe, for each local authority proposed to be established,---
        
    *   (a) the type of local authority; and
    
    *   (b) the name of the district or region of the local authority; and
    
    *   (c) the boundaries of the district or region; and
    
    *   (d) the representation arrangements of the local authority; and
    
    *   (e) the names and areas of interest of iwi and hapū in the district or region; and
    
    *   (f) any communities and any community boards of the local authority; and
    
    *   (g) any other matters the Commission considers necessary or desirable.
    
    (4) However, the Commission may decide, if it considers it more appropriate to do so, to defer including in a draft proposal the representation arrangements or community board arrangements, or both, and include them in the reorganisation scheme.
    
    (5) A draft proposal must also---
        
    *   (a) contain information about the role, powers, and composition of the transition body, including---
            
        *   (i) whether the transition body would include a transition board; and
        
        *   (ii) if a transition board would be included in a transition body, how each affected local authority will be represented on the transition board and whether the transition board will include other persons; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) have attached to it a full and detailed explanation of the advantages and disadvantages of the draft proposal and of how it will promote good local government.
    
    (6) In preparing a draft proposal, the Commission may require a local authority affected by the proposal to provide information to assist the Commission to prepare the proposal.
    
    (7) In preparing a draft proposal, the Commission may undertake inquiries and consultations in relation to the draft proposal with any persons, bodies, and groups it considers appropriate.

##### 15 Local boards
    
*   (1) This clause applies if---
        
    *   (a) the Commission has determined, under [clause 11][1026], that the preferred option for local government of an area is a unitary authority; and
    
    *   (b) the area---
            
        *   (i) will be urban or predominantly urban in nature; and
        
        *   (ii) has, or is predicted to have within a period of 5 years after public notice of the draft proposal, a population that exceeds 400 000\.
        
        
    
    (2) In preparing a draft proposal in relation to the affected area, the Commission may include provisions for local boards if it considers that good local government of the district of the unitary authority would be best promoted by providing for local boards.
    
    (3) Provisions for local boards must be consistent with [sections 7][1073], [10 to 32B][1074], [97 to 99][1075], [102][1076], and [105][1077] of the Local Government (Auckland Council) Act 2009, and those sections apply in relation to the proposed unitary authority as if---
        
    *   (a) every reference to the Council or Auckland Council were a reference to the unitary authority; and
    
    *   (b) every reference to Auckland were a reference to the district of the unitary authority.
    
    (4) A draft proposal must, in addition to the matters specified in [clause 14][1031], specify---
        
    *   (a) the number and names of local board areas within the district; and
    
    *   (b) the boundaries of---
            
        *   (i) each local board area; and
        
        *   (ii) electoral subdivisions, if any, of each local board area; and
        
        
    
    *   (c) the number of elected members of the local board for each local board area and, if a local board area is subdivided for electoral purposes, the number of members to be elected by the electors of each subdivision.
    
    (5) In determining the matters referred to in subclause (4)(a), (b), or (c), the Commission must ensure that---
        
    *   (a) there are no fewer than 4 and no more than 9 members for each local board; and
    
    *   (b) so far as is practicable, the boundaries of local board areas, and any electoral subdivisions, and the number of members to be elected, provide effective representation of communities of interest within the district; and
    
    *   (c) the subdivision of any local board area for electoral purposes provides fair representation for the electors of the local board area; and
    
    *   (d) the local board area boundaries, or subdivisions of those areas for electoral purposes, coincide with boundaries of the current statistical meshblock areas determined by Statistics New Zealand and used for parliamentary electoral purposes; and
    
    *   (e) so far as is practicable, local board area boundaries coincide with ward boundaries.
    
    (6) For the purpose of giving effect to subclause (5)(c), the Commission must ensure that the population of each subdivision divided by the number of members to be elected by the subdivision produces a figure no more than 10% greater or smaller than the population of the local board area divided by the total number of elected members of the local board.
    
    (7) However, if the Commission considers that effective representation of communities of interest so requires, subdivisions may be defined, and membership distributed between them, in a way that does not comply with subclause (6).
    
    (8) [Clause 14(4)][1031] does not apply to a draft proposal under subclause (2).
    
    (9) To avoid doubt, [clauses 14(3)(f)][1031] and [19][1036] do not apply to a draft proposal under subclause (2).
    
    (10) A reorganisation scheme in respect of a final proposal to which subclause (2) applies must, in addition to the matters specified in section 30, make an initial allocation of decision-making responsibility for the non-regulatory activities of the unitary authority between the authority's governing body and its local boards in accordance with [section 17][1078] of the Local Government (Auckland Council) Act 2009 as applied by subclause (3).

##### 16 Cities
    
*   A draft proposal may not provide that a territorial authority is to be called a city council unless the district of the territorial authority---
        
    *   (a) has a population of not less than 50 000 persons; and
    
    *   (b) is predominantly urban; and
    
    *   (c) is a distinct entity and a major centre of activity.
    
    

##### 17 Appropriate boundaries
    
*   In determining boundaries for a draft proposal, the Commission must ensure that,---
        
    *   (a) if practicable, the boundaries of regions conform with catchment boundaries; and
    
    *   (b) if practicable, the boundaries of districts conform with the boundaries of regions; and
    
    *   (c) the boundaries of regions and the boundaries of districts conform with the boundaries of statistical meshblock areas determined by Statistics New Zealand and used for parliamentary electoral purposes.
    
    

##### 18 Representation
    
*   In determining the representation arrangements of a local authority for a draft proposal or (if [clause 14(4)][1031] applies) a reorganisation scheme, the Commission must---
        
    *   (a) have regard to the existing electoral and representation arrangements of the affected local authorities; and
    
    *   (b) provide fair and effective representation for individuals and communities of the local authority; and
    
    *   (c) comply with the requirements of the [Local Electoral Act 2001][543]; and
    
    *   (d) take into account the responsibilities, duties, and powers of the local authority.
    
    

##### 19 Communities
    
*   When preparing a draft proposal or (if [clause 14(4)][1031] applies) a reorganisation scheme, the Commission may consider whether good local government of any affected district would be best promoted by---
        
    *   (a) a system of communities and the responsibilities, duties, and powers of the community boards in the district; or
    
    *   (b) an alternative to an existing system of communities; or
    
    *   (c) a change in the responsibilities, duties, and powers of the community boards in the district.
    
    

##### 20 Consultation on proposal
    
*   (1) As soon as practicable after completing a draft proposal, the Commission must---
        
    *   (a) take the action that it considers necessary to ensure that the persons, bodies, and groups who may be interested in the draft proposal are informed of the proposal; and
    
    *   (b) give public notice of the draft proposal, which must---
            
        *   (i) specify the location where the draft proposal may be inspected or how a copy of the draft proposal may be obtained; and
        
        *   (ii) invite submissions on the draft proposal; and
        
        *   (iii) specify the date by which submissions must be made to the Commission; and
        
        *   (iv) specify the manner in which submissions are to be made; and
        
        
    
    *   (c) seek the views of---
            
        *   (i) the affected local authorities; and
        
        *   (ii) the applicant; and
        
        *   (iii) the Auditor-General; and
        
        *   (iv) the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment; and
        
        *   (v) the Secretary; and
        
        *   (vi) the Secretary for the Environment; and

        *   (xi) each local authority whose district or region adjoins the district or region of an affected local authority; and
        
        *   (xii) any local boards, council-controlled organisations, and community boards of affected local authorities; and
        
        *   (xiii) any other persons, bodies, or groups that the Commission considers appropriate.
        
        
    
    (2) A person, body, or group that wishes to make a submission on a draft proposal must make the submission to the Commission in the manner and by the date specified by the Commission in the public notice.
    
    (3) The Commission must consider each submission received and may hold hearings of submissions or meet with the persons making submissions or their representatives.
    
    (4) The Commission must grant the opportunity to meet, and be heard by, the Commission on the draft proposal to---
        
    *   (a) the affected local authorities; and
    
    *   (b) each local authority whose district or region adjoins the district or region of an affected local authority; and
