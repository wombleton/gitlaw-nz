## Part 1  
Preliminary provisions

##### 3 Purpose
    
*   The purpose of this Act is to provide for democratic and effective local government that recognises the diversity of New Zealand communities; and, to that end, this Act---
        
    *   (a) states the purpose of local government; and
    
    *   (b) provides a framework and powers for local authorities to decide which activities they undertake and the manner in which they will undertake them; and
    
    *   (c) promotes the accountability of local authorities to their communities; and
    
    *   (d) provides for local authorities to play a broad role in meeting the current and future needs of their communities for good-quality local infrastructure, local public services, and performance of regulatory functions.
    
    Section 3(d): replaced, on 5 December 2012, by [section 4][613] of the Local Government Act 2002 Amendment Act 2012 (2012 No 93).

##### 4 Treaty of Waitangi
    
*   In order to recognise and respect the Crown's responsibility to take appropriate account of the principles of the [Treaty of Waitangi][614] and to maintain and improve opportunities for Māori to contribute to local government decision-making processes, [Parts 2][11] and [6][133] provide principles and requirements for local authorities that are intended to facilitate participation by Māori in local authority decision-making processes.

##### 5 Interpretation
    
*   (1) In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,---

##### 48I General scheme
    
*   (1) This section sets out the general scheme of [sections 48J to 48O][85]. These are the provisions of this Act that set out how a unitary authority with local boards makes its decisions. This section is by way of explanation only and does not limit or affect the other provisions of this Act or any other enactment.
    
    (2) Both the governing body and the local boards are responsible and democratically accountable for the decision making of the unitary authority. Whether responsibility for making any particular decision rests with the governing body or with 1 or more local boards depends on the nature of the decision being made.
    
    (3) [Section 48J][85] sets out the classes of decisions that the governing body must make. [Section 48K][86] sets out the classes of decisions that local boards must make. Both sections include a class of decisions in respect of non-regulatory activities of the unitary authority within a local board area. The governing body must allocate responsibility for decisions within this class to either itself or the local board for the area, in accordance with the principles in [section 48L(2)][87]. The results of the allocation must then be set out in the long-term plan and the annual plans of the unitary authority so that people of each local board area, and any other persons, can easily determine whether the governing body or a local board is responsible for any particular decision of the unitary authority.
    
    (4) To determine local wishes and priorities in relation to the non-regulatory activities for which a local board is allocated responsibility, the board must consult its communities. The local board does this by preparing a local board plan under [section 48N][91]. This plan is used as a basis for the board to develop an annual local board agreement with the governing body under [section 48O][92] in which the nature, levels, and funding of the activities are set out.
    
    Section 48I: inserted, on 8 August 2014, by [section 17][738] of the Local Government Act 2002 Amendment Act 2014 (2014 No 55).

##### 48J Decision-making responsibilities of governing body
    
*   (1) The governing body is responsible and democratically accountable for---
        
    *   (a) the decision making of the unitary authority in relation to any regulatory responsibility, duty, or power conferred on, or applying to, the unitary authority under this Act or any other enactment (for example, the responsibilities, duties, or powers conferred on, or applying to, a local authority under the [Resource Management Act 1991][744], the [Health Act 1956][745], the [Building Act 2004][673], and the [Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002][746]); and
    
    *   (b) the decision making of the unitary authority in relation to---
            
        *   (i) transport networks and infrastructure; and
        
        *   (ii) any non-regulatory activities of the unitary authority that are allocated to the governing body in accordance with [section 48L][87]; and
        
        
    
    *   (c) the decision making of the unitary authority in relation to the establishment and maintenance of capacity to provide, or to ensure the provision of, services and facilities (including local activities) by the unitary authority; and
    
    *   (d) the decision making of the unitary authority in relation to the governance of its council-controlled organisations; and
    
    *   (e) the decision making of the unitary authority in relation to compliance with [section 101][182] (which relates to the financial management of a local authority); and
    
    *   (f) reaching agreement with each local board (as set out in each local board agreement) in respect of local activities for the local board areas.
    
    (2) Before making a decision described in subsection (1)(a) to (d), the governing body must---
        
    *   (a) comply with any requirement of this Act; and
    
    *   (b) comply with any requirements of any other enactment; and
    
    *   (c) consider any views and preferences expressed by a local board if the decision affects or may affect the responsibilities or operation of the local board or the well-being of communities within its local board area.

*   (1) Despite section 41(3), each local board is responsible and democratically accountable for---
        
    *   (a) the decision making of the unitary authority in relation to the non-regulatory activities of the unitary authority that are allocated to the local board in accordance with [section 48L][87]; and
    
    *   (b) identifying and communicating to the unitary authority the interests and preferences of the people in its local board area in relation to the content of the strategies, policies, plans, and bylaws of the unitary authority; and
    
    *   (c) identifying and developing bylaws specifically for its local board area, and proposing them to the governing body under [section 150B][259]; and
    
    *   (d) reaching agreement with the governing body (as set out in the local board agreement) in respect of local activities for its local board area.
    
    (2) In carrying out the responsibilities described in this section, a local board must comply with the requirements of [sections 76 to 82][139] as if every reference in those sections to a local authority were a reference to a local board.
    
    (3) In carrying out the responsibilities described in this section, a local board must collaborate and co-operate with 1 or more other local boards or any other body or entity if the local board is satisfied that the interests and preferences of communities within the local board area will be better served by doing so.

##### 48L Principles for allocation of decision-making responsibilities of unitary authority
    
*   (1) Decision-making responsibility for any non-regulatory activity of the unitary authority within a local board area must be allocated by the governing body---
        
    *   (a) to either the governing body or the local board for that area; and
    
    *   (b) in accordance with the principles set out in subsection (2); and
    
    *   (c) after considering the views and preferences expressed by the local board.
    
    (2) The principles are---
        
    *   (a) decision-making responsibility for a non-regulatory activity of the unitary authority within a local board area should be exercised by the local board for that area unless paragraph (b) applies:
    
    *   (b) decision-making responsibility for a non-regulatory activity of the unitary authority within a local board area should be exercised by its governing body if the nature of the activity is such that decision making on a district-wide basis will better promote the interests of the communities in the district because---
            
        *   (i) the impact of the decision will extend beyond the local board area; or
        
        *   (ii) effective decision making will require alignment or integration with other decisions that are the responsibility of the governing body; or
        
        *   (iii) the benefits of a consistent or co-ordinated approach in the district will outweigh the benefits of reflecting the particular needs and preferences of the communities within the local board area.
        
        
    
    (3) The long-term plan and each annual plan must identify the non-regulatory activities of the unitary authority for which decision-making responsibility is allocated to 1 or more local boards as set out in [clauses 17A][747] and [21A][748] of Schedule 10\.

##### 48M Local boards funding policy
    
*   (1) To provide for predictability and certainty about levels of funding for local boards, a unitary authority must adopt a local boards funding policy as part of its long-term plan.
    
    (2) The local boards funding policy must set---
        
    *   (a) the basis on which the total funds to be allocated to meet the cost of all local activities within the district is to be determined; and
    
    *   (b) the formula by which the total funds allocated by the unitary authority for meeting the cost of funding local activities are to be allocated to each local board; and
    
    *   (c) the formula by which the total funds allocated by the unitary authority for meeting the cost of funding the administrative support to local boards are to be allocated to each local board.
    
    (3) The local boards funding policy must also identify any funding (except funding dedicated to particular purposes) that may be available to local boards for local activities and the criteria or process by which it may be allocated to them.
    
    (4) The formula referred to in subsection (2)(b) must allocate funds to each local board in a way that provides an equitable capacity for the local board to enhance the well-being of the communities in its local board area, having regard to the following factors:
        
    *   (a) the level of dependence on local government services and facilities in each local board area and in other parts of the district (as informed by information available to the unitary authority by reasonable means, and relating to the socio-economic, population, age profile, and other demographic characteristics of each local board area and other part of the district); and
    
    *   (b) the costs of achieving and maintaining the identified levels of service provision for local activities in each local board area; and
    
    *   (c) the rates revenue and any other revenue derived from each local board area in relation to local activities; and
    
    *   (d) any other factor identified by the unitary authority as significantly affecting the nature and level of services needed in any local board area or any other part of the district (for example, the geographic isolation of a particular local board area or part of the district).
    
    (5) The formula referred to in subsection (2)(c) must allocate funds to each local board in a way that provides equitable resources and support to that local board, having regard to the following factors:
        
    *   (a) the number of elected members on the local board; and
    
    *   (b) the size of the local board area; and

    *   (b) development contributions should be determined in a manner that is generally consistent with the capacity life of the assets for which they are intended to be used and in a way that avoids over-recovery of costs allocated to development contribution funding:
    
    *   (c) cost allocations used to establish development contributions should be determined according to, and be proportional to, the persons who will benefit from the assets to be provided (including the community as a whole) as well as those who create the need for those assets:
    
    *   (d) development contributions must be used---
            
        *   (i) for or towards the purpose of the activity or the group of activities for which the contributions were required; and
        
        *   (ii) for the benefit of the district or the part of the district that is identified in the development contributions policy in which the development contributions were required:
        
        
    
    *   (e) territorial authorities should make sufficient information available to demonstrate what development contributions are being used for and why they are being used:
    
    *   (f) development contributions should be predictable and be consistent with the methodology and schedules of the territorial authority's development contributions policy under [sections 106][189], [201][367], and [202][369]:
    
    *   (g) when calculating and requiring development contributions, territorial authorities may group together certain developments by geographic area or categories of land use, provided that---
            
        *   (i) the grouping is done in a manner that balances practical and administrative efficiencies with considerations of fairness and equity; and
        
        *   (ii) grouping by geographic area avoids grouping across an entire district wherever practical.

##### 1 Methodology for relating cost of community facilities to units of demand

    *   (a) identify the total cost of the capital expenditure that the local authority expects to incur in respect of the community facility, or activity or group of activities, to meet increased demand resulting from growth within the district, or part of the district, as the case may be; and
    
    *   (b) identify the share of that expenditure attributable to each unit of demand, using the units of demand for the community facility or for separate activities or groups of activities, as the case may be, by which the impact of growth has been assessed.
    
    (2) A territorial authority may identify capital expenditure for the purposes of calculating development contributions in respect of assets or groups of assets that will be built after the period covered by the long-term plan and that are identified in the development contributions policy.
    
    (3) The total cost of capital identified in subclause (1) may in part relate to assets intended to be delivered beyond the period covered by a territorial authority's long-term plan if---
        
    *   (a) the assets concerned are identified in the development contributions policy; and
    
    *   (b) the total cost of capital expenditure does not exceed that which relates to the period over which development has been assessed for the purpose of setting development contributions.
