##### 1 Short Title
    
*   This Act may be cited as the Local Authorities (Members' Interests) Act 1968\.

##### 2 Interpretation
    
*   (1) In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,---
    
    _contract_, in relation to any local authority, means a contract made by any person directly with the local authority; and includes any relationship with the local authority which is intended to constitute a contract but is not an enforceable contract; but does not include any contract for the employment of any person as an officer or servant of the local authority; and _contractor_ has a corresponding meaning
    
    _incorporated company_ means a company incorporated under the [Companies Act 1993][14] or any former Companies Act or a society incorporated under the [Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1908][15] or any former Industrial and Provident Societies Act
    
    _local authority_ means---
        
    *   (a) every local authority or public body of any of the classes for the time being specified in [Part 1][16] of Schedule 1:
    
    *   (b) every local authority or public body for the time being referred to in [Part 2][17] of Schedule 1
    
    _partner_, in the phrase "spouse or partner", means a civil union partner or a de facto partner
    
    _subcontract_, in relation to any contract made by a local authority, means a subcontract made with the contractor under that contract, or with another subcontractor, to do any work or perform any service or supply any goods or do any other act to which the head contract relates; and includes any subsidiary transaction relating to any such contract or subcontract; and _subcontractor_ has a corresponding meaning.
    
    (2) For the purposes of this Act, a company shall be deemed to control another company if it owns 50% or more of the issued capital of that other company or is able to control the exercise of 50% or more of the total voting powers exercisable by all the members of that other company.
    
    (3) The Governor-General may from time to time, by Order in Council, amend [Schedule 1][11] by including therein the name of any class of local authorities or public bodies or the name of any specified local authority or public body.

##### 3 Disqualifying contracts between local authorities and their members
    
*   (1) Except as provided in subsection (3), no person shall be capable of being elected as or appointed to be or of being a member of a local authority or of any committee of a local authority, if the total of all payments made or to be made by or on behalf of the local authority in respect of all contracts made by it in which that person is concerned or interested exceeds $25,000 in any financial year.
    
    (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), a member of a local authority or of a committee thereof shall be deemed to be concerned or interested in a contract made by a local authority with an incorporated company, if---
        
    *   (a) the member or his spouse or partner singly or between them own, whether directly or through a nominee, 10% or more of the issued capital of the company or of any other company controlling that company; or
    
    *   (b) the member or his spouse or partner is a member of the company, and either of them is the managing director or the general manager (by whatever names they are called) of the company; or
    
    *   (c) the member or his spouse or partner is a member of a company controlling the company with which the contract is made and either of them is the managing director or the general manager (by whatever names they are called) of that controlling company; or
    
    *   (d) the member or his spouse or partner is the managing director or general manager (by whatever names they are called) of the company and either of them is a member of a company controlling that company:
    
    provided that nothing in this subsection shall apply with respect to the spouse or partner of any member where, at the time when the contract was entered into,---
        
    *   (i) the member and his spouse or partner were living apart; or
    
    *   (ii) in any case to which paragraph (a) applies, the member did not know and had no reasonable opportunity of knowing that his spouse or partner owned any part of the issued capital of the company or of any company controlling that company; or
    
    *   (iii) in any case to which paragraph (b) or paragraph (c) or paragraph (d) applies, the member did not know and had no reasonable opportunity of knowing that his spouse or partner was a member of the company or of the controlling company, as the case may be, or held any of the offices specified in any of those paragraphs.
    
    (2A) For the purposes of subsection (1), a member of a local authority or of a committee thereof shall be deemed to be concerned or interested in a contract made by the local authority in which his spouse or partner is concerned or interested (not being a contract made with an incorporated company):
    
    provided that nothing in this subsection shall apply with respect to the spouse or partner of any member where, at the time when the contract was entered into,---
        
    *   (a) the member and his spouse or partner were living apart; or
    
    *   (b) the member did not know and had no reasonable opportunity of knowing that his spouse or partner was concerned or interested in the contract.
    
    (3) Notwithstanding anything in subsection (1),---
        
    *   (a) no person shall be disqualified under this section by virtue of his being concerned or interested in any contract made in any special case with the prior approval of the Auditor-General on the application of the local authority. In any such special case the Auditor-General may authorise the payment and receipt of such amount as it thinks fit:
    
    *   (aa) a person shall be deemed not to have been disqualified by virtue of his being concerned or interested in any contract made in any special case where, on the application of the local authority, the subsequent approval of the Auditor-General is obtained; which approval shall be given only if the Auditor-General is satisfied that---
            
        *   (i) there is a sufficient special reason why prior approval was not obtained under paragraph (a); and
        
        *   (ii) prior approval would have been obtained under paragraph (a) if that approval had been sought:
        
        
    
    *   (ab) no person shall be disqualified under this section by virtue of his being concerned or interested in any contract made on behalf of the local authority by an employee or committee of the local authority (unless the member of the local authority is a member of that committee) acting under delegated authority, where it is verified in writing to the Auditor-General, by such 1 or more persons and in such manner as the Auditor-General requires, that the member did not know and had no reasonable opportunity of knowing of that contract at the time it was made:
    
    *   (b) where a person is concerned or interested in any contract solely by reason of being concerned or interested in any subcontract relating thereto, the provisions of this section shall, with the necessary modifications, apply to him as if references in this section to the amount payable by or on behalf of the local authority in respect of a contract were references to the amount payable by or on behalf of the contractor in respect of the subcontract:
    
    *   (c) in assessing under this section the amount of any payment made or to be made by or on behalf of the local authority in respect of any contract, no account shall be taken of any sum paid or to be paid as a refund of a deposit:
    
    *   (d) an interest in---
            
        *   (i) any loan raised by the local authority, whether on security or otherwise; or
        
        *   (ii) any payments made or to be made in respect of advertisements inserted by the local authority in any newspaper; or
        
        *   (iii) any lease granted or agreed to be granted to the local authority; or
        
        *   (iv) any payment received by way of compensation under the [Public Works Act 1981][20] for any loss, damage, or injury suffered by reason of the exercise of any power under that Act; or
        
        *   (v) any advance made by the local authority under the Rural Housing Act 1939; or
        
        *   (vi) any advance made or guarantee given by the local authority under [Part 32][21] of the Local Government Act 1974; or
        
        *   (vii) any contract for the supply of goods or services made during a state of emergency declared under the [Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002][22], if that contract does not continue for more than 1 month after the cessation of that state of emergency, and if the goods or services are supplied at charges not in excess of those normally applying in the district of the local authority or in the area under its jurisdiction at the time immediately preceding the state of emergency,---
        
        shall not constitute a disqualification under this section:
    
    *   (e) \[Repealed\]
    
    *   (f) no person shall be disqualified under this section by virtue of his being concerned or interested in any contract made before his election or appointment, if before that election or appointment his obligation in respect of the contract had been performed and the amount to be paid by or on behalf of the local authority in respect of the contract had been fixed; and any payment made thereafter by or on behalf of the local authority in respect of the contract shall not operate to disqualify that person for continuing to hold office or be taken into account for the purpose of calculating the amount that may be lawfully paid to him as a member of the local authority or, as the case may be, of a committee thereof in the same financial year in respect of any contract or contracts:
    
    *   (g) no person shall be disqualified under this section by virtue of his being concerned or interested in any contract, whether of a continuing nature or otherwise, made before his election or appointment and in respect of which his obligations have not been performed before that election or appointment, where the amount to be paid by or on behalf of the local authority in respect of the performance of the contract has been fixed in that contract subject to such amendments and additions as may be provided for in the contract, or, where the amount to be paid by or on behalf of the local authority in respect of the performance of the contract is not ascertainable until the contract has been performed, if---
            
        *   (i) the contract is for a continuous period not exceeding 12 months from the date on which the contract is made; or
        
        *   (ii) the contract is for a continuous period exceeding 12 months from the date on which the contract is made and that person has, with the consent of the local authority, relinquished that contract before acting as a member and within 1 month after the date of his election or appointment, as the case may be;---
        
        and any payment made thereafter by or on behalf of the local authority in respect of the contract shall not operate to disqualify that person for continuing to hold office or be taken into account for the purpose of calculating the amount that may be lawfully paid to him as a member of the local authority or, as the case may be, of a committee thereof in the same financial year in respect of any contract or contracts:
    
    *   (h) no person shall be disqualified under this section by virtue of his being concerned or interested in any contract as an administrator or a trustee of any estate or trust in which he is not a beneficiary, or as the manager appointed under the [Protection of Personal and Property Rights Act 1988][23]:
    
    *   (i) no person shall be disqualified under this section by virtue of his being concerned or interested in any agreement entered into pursuant to section 81 of the Noxious Plants Act 1978:
    
    *   (j) no person who is a member of a community board is disqualified under this section by virtue of that person or that person's spouse or partner being concerned or interested in any contract made by a territorial authority, if---
            
        *   (i) the contract, except for any preliminary work associated with it, is to be performed wholly outside the area under the jurisdiction of the community board of which that person is a member; and
        
        *   (ii) the contract is one in which the community board has no jurisdiction or control or which has not been reported on to the territorial authority by the community board; and
        
        *   (iii) neither that person nor that person's spouse or partner is also a member of the territorial authority that made the contract.
        
        
    
    (3A) Nothing in subsection (3)(j)(iii) applies with respect to the spouse or partner of a member where, at the time when the contract was entered into, the member and the member's spouse or partner were living apart.
    
    (4) For the purposes of subsection (3)(j), _territorial authority_ has the same meaning as in the [Local Government Act 2002][24].
