    And whereas one of the terms and conditions aforesaid was that the Council should before raising the loan make provision for repayment by establishing a sinking fund:
    
    And whereas the Council, pursuant to the said Order in Council, has raised a loan of 700 pounds from the State Advances Corporation of New Zealand, but has not made specific provision for a sinking fund as required by the said Order in Council:
    
    And whereas the Council has issued a series of 40 debentures numbered 1 to 40 inclusive each for the sum of 24 pounds 9 shillings and 7 pence, being the half-yearly sum required to provide for the repayment of the said sum of 700 pounds with interest thereon at the rate of 3 pounds 10 shillings per centum per annum:
    
    And whereas the said loan of 700 pounds was accordingly unlawfully borrowed, and it is desirable to validate the action of the Council in borrowing the same:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    The action of the Council in borrowing the said sum of 700 pounds is hereby validated and the said moneys shall be deemed to have been lawfully borrowed and the securities given in respect thereof to have been lawfully issued, and the said debentures shall have full force and effect according to their tenor.

    And whereas by an Order in Council dated 8 November 1939, which came into force on 1 April 1940, the Southern Hawke's Bay Rabbit District was constituted and the boundaries of the area comprised therein were defined and declared a rabbit district:
    
    And whereas such area comprised the area excluded from the Hawke's Bay Rabbit District by the first-recited Order in Council:
    
    And whereas the Boards of the 2 districts have entered into an agreement providing for the equitable division of the funds of the Hawke's Bay Rabbit Board as at 1 April 1940 between the 2 Boards on the basis of the amount of rates struck in the 2 districts for the year ended on 31 March 1940:
    
    And whereas such division was effected pursuant to the said agreement by the transfer of certain assets from the Hawke's Bay Rabbit Board to the Southern Hawke's Bay Rabbit Board and by a cash payment of 40 pounds 18 shillings and 4 pence:
    
    And whereas it is desirable that such transfer and payment be validated and confirmed:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    (1) The payment made by the Hawke's Bay Rabbit Board of the sum of 40 pounds 18 shillings and 4 pence and the transfers made by the Hawke's Bay Rabbit Board to the Southern Hawke's Bay Rabbit Board of the assets described in subsection (2) are hereby validated and declared to have been lawfully made.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Local Legislation Act 1942\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 8 September 1999, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][63] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][64] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][65] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][66] and [17E][67] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
