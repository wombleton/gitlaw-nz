    *   (a) The amount secured by such policy, where the insurance is effected for the benefit of more than one, may, if not apportioned in the policy, be apportioned by the husband by any deed or instrument in writing under his hand, or by his last will and testament, as he deems proper:
    
    *   (b) Where no apportionment is made in any policy as aforesaid, or by deed, instrument in writing, or will as aforesaid, all parties interested in the said insurance shall be held to share equally in the same:
    
    *   (c) When it is stated in such policy that the insurance is for the benefit of the wife, or wife and any one or more of the children, of the insured, or of his wife or of the children generally, without specifying her or their names, then the word _wife_ shall mean the wife living at the time when the policy becomes payable; and _children_ shall, unless otherwise defined in the policy, mean the children of the insured, whether or not of the same marriage, living at the time when the policy becomes payable, and shall include a child or children _en ventre sa mere_ at such time:
    
    *   (d) Where a wife's name is not stated in any policy, the husband, by a written application signed by him and attested by a witness, may apply to the company to have such name inserted in the policy, and the company may thereupon direct the secretary to insert the wife's name accordingly in the policy in such manner as it thinks best:
    
    *   (e) In a similar manner and by a like procedure the husband, on remarriage, may require the name of his then wife to be substituted for that of any former wife inserted in such policy:
    
    *   (f) Where such a policy is effected for the benefit of more persons than one, and the sum assured has been apportioned by the person whose life is assured, such apportionment shall be valid notwithstanding that all the persons mentioned as beneficiaries in the policy may not be included in such apportionment; and the payment made by the company in terms of such apportionment shall be deemed to release the company from all claims under the policy:
    
    *   (g) Any person having taken out such a policy with right to participate in the profits may, subject to the regulations or bylaws of the company issuing the policy, from time to time either direct the application of such profits in payment or reduction of premiums, or direct the same, when converted into a reversionary bonus, to be added to the insurance money; and the share of each person, when more than one are benefited, shall, in the case of such additions, be proportionately increased. If no direction is given, then the profits shall be converted into a reversionary bonus:
    
    *   (h) The benefit of any such policy shall revert to the insured when the child for whose benefit it was effected, or the surviving child for whose benefit it exists, dies without issue before the insured, or when the wife for whose benefit solely it exists predeceases her husband with or without issue; and the benefit of any share in an apportionment shall likewise revert to the insured when the child to whom it was apportioned dies without issue before the insured, or when the wife to whom it was apportioned predeceases her husband with or without issue:
    
    *   (i) Where the insured and all the persons beneficially interested under such a policy are _sui juris_, they may jointly assign, mortgage, discharge, or otherwise deal with the policy as fully and effectually as the assured could have done if he held it for his own use and benefit only:
    
    *   (j) Where a policy reverts to the insured in whole or for a share or shares, the insured may deal with such policy or share or shares as if the insurance had been effected and been always held for his own benefit:
    
    *   (k) Any person who has taken out such a policy, and who finds himself unable to continue to pay the premiums, may from time to time borrow on the security of the policy, from the company who issued the same, or from any person, such sum as may be necessary to keep the policy in force, such loans to be secured by mortgage on the policy:
        
        Provided that no such mortgage shall operate to secure the payment of the money advanced on the security thereof unless the money so advanced is at the time of advancing the same wholly applied in making the payments necessary to keep the policy in force:
    
    *   (l) Notwithstanding anything in any law or statute, or in any rule of law or equity to the contrary, the holder of any such policy may from time to time, with the consent of his wife living at the time, borrow on the security of the policy such sums as he thinks fit, and grant a mortgage on the policy as a security for any such loan.

ON the part of the mortgagor,---
    
*   (a) That during the continuance of this mortgage the mortgagor will duly and punctually, at the proper times for so doing, make all payments and do all such acts, deeds, matters, and things as are necessary to keep the policy hereby mortgaged in full force, and after making any such payment will produce to the mortgagee the receipt for the same, and will not do, or permit or suffer to be done, any act, deed, matter, or thing whereby or by means whereof the policy hereby mortgaged may lapse or become void, or become liable to lapse or become void in any manner whatsoever:

*   (b) That if from any cause whatever the mortgagor fails or neglects to make all or any part of the payments necessary to keep the said policy in force, it shall be lawful for but not imperative on the mortgagee to make such payments on behalf of the mortgagor, and the same, with interest thereon at $8 percent per annum from the date of payment by the mortgagee until repayment to him shall be repayable by the mortgagor to the mortgagee immediately upon demand, and, until repayment, shall be a charge upon the hereby mortgaged policy, and the same shall not be redeemable until such money is repaid:

*   (c) That, subject as is hereinafter mentioned, the mortgagee shall be entitled to the custody of the policy hereby mortgaged during the continuance of this mortgage:

*   (d) That if the amount assured by the policy hereby mortgaged becomes a claim or becomes payable prior to the day mentioned in this mortgage for the payment of the principal money intended to be hereby secured, then and in such case the said principal money and interest thereon up to date shall be deemed to be due and payable to the mortgagee on the day on which the said amount became payable, in lieu of the day so mentioned in this mortgage for payment; and the mortgagee's receipt and discharge for the payment of the said amount shall be deemed to be, to the extent thereof, a receipt and discharge of the money assured by the policy hereby mortgaged.

And, on the part of the mortgagee,---
    
*   (e) That upon repayment of all the principal money and interest secured by this mortgage at the time herein specified for payment of the same, and upon performance and observance of such other obligations or agreements as are by this mortgage provided, he, the mortgagee, will execute a discharge of such mortgage in accordance with the provisions of the Life Insurance Act 1908, and will thereupon deliver this mortgage, with such discharge endorsed thereon, and the policy hereby mortgaged to the mortgagor:

And, on the part of the mortgagee,---
    
*   (d) That if all the principal and interest money hereby secured is duly paid off and satisfied according to the terms and provisions of this mortgage, then and in such case, if the policy hereby mortgaged is then in full force, and has not lapsed or become void, or become liable to lapse or to be declared void, the mortgagee shall duly execute and procure to be registered, in accordance with the provisions of the Life Insurance Act 1908, a discharge of this mortgage, and then shall return the said policy to the mortgagor:

##### 2 Commencement
    
*   This Act comes into force on 25 January 2005\.

## Transitional provisions

##### 32 Application of provisions relating to financial year
    
*   (1) Despite the enactment of this Act, any existing provisions of the principal Act that relate to a financial year continue to apply only in respect of---
        
    *   (a) either of the following:
            
        *   (i) the financial year ending on 30 June 2005; or
        
        *   (ii) a later financial year specified by the Governor-General by Order in Council made on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) each previous financial year.
    
    (2) Any provisions of the principal Act (as amended by this Act) that relate to a financial year must be read as if those provisions apply only in respect of---
        
    *   (a) either of the following:
            
        *   (i) the financial year commencing on 1 July 2005; or
        
        *   (ii) if a later financial year is specified by the Governor-General by Order in Council made under subsection (1)(a)(ii), the next financial year; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) each subsequent financial year.

*   (1) The reporting requirements and provisions that would have applied if this Act had not been enacted continue to apply, in respect of the financial year specified in subsection (3), to a department and an Office of Parliament, rather than the reporting requirements and provisions enacted by this Act or any other Act.
    
    (2) Therefore, for example, a department and an Office of Parliament must comply with the requirements relating to annual financial statements, annual reports, and audits that were in the principal Act immediately before the commencement of this Act.
    
    (3) The financial year referred to in subsection (1) is---
        
    *   (a) the financial year ending on 30 June 2005; or
    
    *   (b) if a later financial year is specified by the Governor-General by Order in Council made under section 32(1)(a)(ii), that financial year.
    
    (4) To avoid doubt, this section does not limit section 32\.
    
    (5) Section 198 of the Crown Entities Act 2004 applies to an organisation named or described in Schedule 4\.

##### 34 Existing bank accounts, investments, borrowing, guarantees, and derivatives
    
*   (1) This section applies to any bank account, investment, borrowing, guarantee, or derivative transaction of an organisation that is named or described in Schedule 4 of the principal Act at the date of commencement of this Act that the organisation would be restricted from acquiring, giving, or entering into under this Act.
    
    (2) The bank account, investment, borrowing, guarantee, or derivative transaction is not affected by the enactment of this Act.
    
    (3) However, the terms of the investment, borrowing, guarantee, or derivative transaction may be amended, or any options resulting from the investment, borrowing, or derivative transaction, may be taken up, only if permitted by the Minister of Finance.

##### 35 Regulations for transitional and savings purposes
    
*   (1) The Governor-General may, by Order in Council, make regulations prescribing transitional or savings provisions relating to the coming into force of this Act.
    
    (2) Any transitional or savings provisions prescribed in regulations made under subsection (1) may be in addition to or in place of any of the provisions of sections 32 to 34\.

##### 36 References in trust deeds to section 25 of principal Act
    
*   Every reference to section 25 of the principal Act that is in a trust deed at the date of commencement of this section must be read as a reference to section 161 of the Crown Entities Act 2004\.
