    Compare: 1982 No 156 [s 4][97]

## Part 1  
Access to local authority information

##### 5 Principle of availability
    
*   The question whether any official information is to be made available, where that question arises under this Act, shall be determined, except where this Act otherwise expressly requires, in accordance with the purposes of this Act and the principle that the information shall be made available unless there is good reason for withholding it.
    
    Compare: 1982 No 156 [s 5][98]

##### 6 Conclusive reasons for withholding official information
    
*   Good reason for withholding official information exists, for the purpose of [section 5][7], if the making available of that information would be likely---
        
    *   (a) to prejudice the maintenance of the law, including the prevention, investigation, and detection of offences, and the right to a fair trial; or
    
    *   (b) to endanger the safety of any person.
    
    Compare: 1982 No 156 [s 6(c), (d)][99]; 1987 No 8 [s 3][100]

##### 7 Other reasons for withholding official information
    
*   (1) Where this section applies, good reason for withholding official information exists, for the purpose of [section 5][7], unless, in the circumstances of the particular case, the withholding of that information is outweighed by other considerations which render it desirable, in the public interest, to make that information available.
    
    (2) Subject to [sections 6][8], [8][10], and [17][20], this section applies if, and only if, the withholding of the information is necessary to---
        
    *   (a) protect the privacy of natural persons, including that of deceased natural persons; or
    
    *   (b) protect information where the making available of the information---
            
        *   (i) would disclose a trade secret; or
        
        *   (ii) would be likely unreasonably to prejudice the commercial position of the person who supplied or who is the subject of the information; or
        
        
    
    *   (ba) in the case only of an application for a resource consent, or water conservation order, or a requirement for a designation or heritage order, under the [Resource Management Act 1991][101], to avoid serious offence to tikanga Maori, or to avoid the disclosure of the location of waahi tapu; or
    
    *   (c) protect information which is subject to an obligation of confidence or which any person has been or could be compelled to provide under the authority of any enactment, where the making available of the information---
            
        *   (i) would be likely to prejudice the supply of similar information, or information from the same source, and it is in the public interest that such information should continue to be supplied; or
        
        *   (ii) would be likely otherwise to damage the public interest; or
        
        
    
    *   (d) avoid prejudice to measures protecting the health or safety of members of the public; or
    
    *   (e) avoid prejudice to measures that prevent or mitigate material loss to members of the public; or
    
    *   (f) maintain the effective conduct of public affairs through---
            
        *   (i) the free and frank expression of opinions by or between or to members or officers or employees of any local authority, or any persons to whom [section 2(5)][3] applies, in the course of their duty; or
        
        *   (ii) the protection of such members, officers, employees, and persons from improper pressure or harassment; or
        
        
    
    *   (g) maintain legal professional privilege; or
    
    *   (h) enable any local authority holding the information to carry out, without prejudice or disadvantage, commercial activities; or
    
    *   (i) enable any local authority holding the information to carry on, without prejudice or disadvantage, negotiations (including commercial and industrial negotiations); or
    
    *   (j) prevent the disclosure or use of official information for improper gain or improper advantage.

    Section 7(2)(ba): inserted, on 1 October 1991, by [section 362][95] of the Resource Management Act 1991 (1991 No 69).

##### 8 Information concerning existence of certain information
    
*   Where a request under this Act relates to information to which [section 6][8] or [section 7(2)(b)][9] applies, or would, if it existed, apply, the local authority dealing with the request may, if it is satisfied that the interest protected by section 6 or section 7(2)(b) would be likely to be prejudiced by the disclosure of the existence or non-existence of such information, give notice in writing to the applicant that it neither confirms nor denies the existence or non-existence of that information.
    
    Compare: 1982 No 156 [s 10][105]; 1987 No 8 [s 4(2)][103]

##### 9 Exclusion of public interest immunity
    
*   (1) Subject to subsection (2), the rule of law which authorises or requires the withholding of any document, or the refusal to answer any question, on the ground that the disclosure of the document or the answering of the question would be injurious to the public interest shall not apply in respect of---
        
    *   (a) an investigation by or proceedings before an Ombudsman in relation to any decision under this Act; or
    
    *   (b) any application under [section 4(1)][106] of the Judicature Amendment Act 1972 for the review of any decision under this Act;---
    
    but not so as to give any party any information that that party would not, apart from this section, be entitled to.
    
    (2) Nothing in subsection (1) affects---
        
    *   (a) [section 31][41]; or
    
    *   (b) [section 20(1)][107] of the Ombudsmen Act 1975\.
