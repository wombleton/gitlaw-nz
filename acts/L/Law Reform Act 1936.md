    Provided that this subsection shall not apply to causes of action for defamation or for inducing one spouse to leave or remain apart from the other.
    
    (2) Where a cause of action survives as aforesaid for the benefit of the estate of a deceased person, the damages recoverable for the benefit of the estate of that person---
        
    *   (a) Shall not include any exemplary damages:
    
    *   (b) \[Repealed\]
    
    *   (c) Where the death of that person has been caused by the act or omission which gives rise to the cause of action, shall be calculated without reference to any loss or gain to his estate consequent on his death, except that a sum in respect of funeral expenses may be included:
    
    *   (d) Shall not include any damages for the loss of earnings of the person relating to the period when, but for the death of the person, he or she would have been likely to receive earnings from his or her employment or other occupation.
    
    (3) No proceedings shall be maintainable in respect of a cause of action in tort which by virtue of this Part of this Act has survived against the estate of a deceased person, unless either---
        
    *   (a) Proceedings against him in respect of that cause of action were pending at the date of his death; or
    
    *   (b) The cause of action arose not earlier than 2 years before his death and proceedings are taken in respect thereof not later than 12 months after his personal representative took out representation:
    
    Provided that no such proceedings shall be maintainable unless notice in writing giving reasonable information of the circumstances upon which the proceedings will be based and the name and address of the prospective plaintiff and of his solicitor or agent (if any) in the matter is given by the prospective plaintiff to the personal representative of the deceased person as soon as practicable after the personal representative took out representation.
    
    (3A) Notwithstanding anything in [subsection (3)][5] of this section, application may be made to the Court, after notice to the personal representative, for leave to bring the proceedings at any time before the expiration of 6 years after the start date of the claim's primary period (as specified in [section 11(1)][18] of, and adjusted in accordance with all relevant exceptions and modifications (if any) set out in, the Limitation Act 2010), whether or not notice has been given to the personal representative under subsection [(3)][5] of this section; and the Court may, if it thinks it is just to do so, grant leave accordingly, subject to such conditions (if any) as it thinks it is just to impose, where it considers that the failure to give the notice or the delay in bringing the proceedings, as the case may be, was occasioned by mistake or by any other reasonable cause or that the personal representative was not materially prejudiced in his defence or otherwise by the failure or delay. No distribution of any part of the estate of the deceased made before the date of the giving of the notice of the intended application shall be disturbed by reason of the application or of an order made thereon.
    
    (4) Where damage has been suffered by reason of any act or omission in respect of which a cause of action would have subsisted against any person if that person had not died before or at the same time as the damage was suffered, there shall be deemed, for the purposes of this Part of this Act, to have been subsisting against him before his death such cause of action in respect of that act or omission as would have subsisted if he had died after the damage was suffered.
    
    (5) The rights conferred by this Part of this Act for the benefit of the estates of deceased persons shall be in addition to and not in derogation of any rights conferred by the [Deaths by Accidents Compensation Act 1952][19], and so much of this Part of this Act as relates to causes of action against the estates of deceased persons shall apply in relation to causes of action under that Act.
    
    (6) \[Repealed\]
    
    (7) No contract of insurance entered into under the Motor Vehicles Insurance (Third Party Risks) Act 1928 in respect of any period before the 1st day of June 1937, shall, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in that Act, be deemed to indemnify the insured---

    *   (b) Against liability to pay damages in respect of any cause of action which by virtue of this Part of this Act has survived for the benefit of the estate of a deceased person unless proceedings in respect of that cause of action were pending at the date of his death or proceedings are taken in respect of the cause of action not later than 12 months after his personal representative took out representation.

*   (1) If any person (hereinafter in this Part of this Act referred to as the insured) has, whether before or after the passing of this Act, entered into a contract of insurance by which he is indemnified against liability to pay any damages or compensation, the amount of his liability shall, on the happening of the event giving rise to the claim for damages or compensation, and notwithstanding that the amount of such liability may not then have been determined, be a charge on all insurance money that is or may become payable in respect of that liability.
    
    (2) If, on the happening of the event giving rise to any claim for damages or compensation as aforesaid, the insured has died insolvent or is bankrupt or, in the case of a corporation, is being wound up, or if any subsequent bankruptcy or winding up of the insured is deemed to have commenced not later than the happening of that event, the provisions of the last preceding subsection shall apply notwithstanding the insolvency, bankruptcy, or winding up of the insured.
    
    (3) Every charge created by this section shall have priority over all other charges affecting the said insurance money, and where the same insurance money is subject to 2 or more charges by virtue of this Part of this Act those charges shall have priority between themselves in the order of the dates of the events out of which the liability arose, or, if such charges arise out of events happening on the same date, they shall rank equally between themselves.
    
    (4) Every such charge as aforesaid shall be enforceable by way of an action against the insurer in the same way and in the same Court as if the action were an action to recover damages or compensation from the insured; and in respect of any such action and of the judgment given therein the parties shall, to the extent of the charge, have the same rights and liabilities, and the Court shall have the same powers, as if the action were against the insured:
    
    Provided that, except where the provisions of subsection [(2)][8] of this section apply, no such action shall be commenced in any Court except with the leave of that Court.
    
    (5) Such an action may be brought although judgment has been already recovered against the insured for damages or compensation in respect of the same matter.
    
    (6) Any payment made by an insurer under the contract of insurance without actual notice of the existence of any such charge shall to the extent of that payment be a valid discharge to the insurer, notwithstanding anything in this Part of this Act contained.
    
    (7) No insurer shall be liable under this Part of this Act for any sum beyond the limits fixed by the contract of insurance between himself and the insured.

##### 9A Claims for damages or compensation against estate of deceased owner where no administrator
    
*   (1) Where---
        
    *   (a) Any person desires to claim damages or compensation on account of any event, whether happening before or after the commencement of this section, in respect of which a contract of insurance was in force at the time of the happening of the event indemnifying the insured from liability in respect of those damages or that compensation; and
    
    *   (b) The insured is deceased and there is in New Zealand no administrator within the meaning of the [Administration Act 1969][26] of the estate of the insured,---
    
    the person desiring to claim those damages or that compensation may give notice in writing to the insurer requiring the insurer to nominate some person to be the defendant in place of the insured in any action proposed to be brought in any Court claiming those damages or that compensation.
    
    (2) Within 14 days after the service on the insurer of such a notice, the insurer may, by notice in writing served on the claimant, nominate some person (with his consent) to be the defendant in the proposed action, and thereupon the claimant may sue the defendant so nominated, describing him as the administrator _ad litem_ of the estate of the insured.
    
    (3) If within the said period of 14 days the insurer does not nominate a defendant as aforesaid, the Court in which an action claiming those damages or that compensation is intended to be commenced may, on the application of the claimant, appoint Public Trust to be the administrator _ad litem_ of the estate of the insured for the purposes of the intended action, and it shall be the duty of Public Trust to act as such.
    
    (4) Where any such appointment is made, the claimant may sue Public Trust, describing it as the administrator _ad litem_ of the estate of the insured.
    
    (5) The person nominated as the defendant by the insurer or, as the case may be, Public Trust shall be indemnified by the insurer in respect of any judgment against it (including the costs of the action and any costs awarded under subsection [(6)][9] of this section), and also in respect of all costs and expenses reasonably incurred by it in or in connection with the action irrespective of the result of the action, and, in the case of Public Trust, shall be entitled to recover from the insurer reasonable remuneration for its services:
    
    Provided that, where in any such action the plaintiff obtains judgment against the administrator _ad litem_, the judgment shall not be enforceable against the administrator _ad litem_ by execution or otherwise except to the extent to which the insured was entitled to be indemnified by the insurer under the contract of insurance, and, to the extent to which the judgment is not so enforceable, the amount thereof shall be deemed to be a liability of the estate (if any) of the insured, and shall be enforceable accordingly against that estate.
    
    (6) Where in any action against Public Trust as administrator _ad litem_ the plaintiff recovers judgment, the Court may award the plaintiff his costs of and incidental to the order appointing Public Trust as such administrator.
    
    (7) No appointment or nomination of an administrator _ad litem_ under this section shall confer any rights or impose any obligations on Public Trust or on the person so nominated in respect of any other assets of the estate of the insured or any liabilities in connection with that estate.
    
    Section 9A was inserted by section 2 Law Reform Amendment Act 1957\.
    
    Section 9A was amended, as from 1 March 2002, by section [170(1)][27] Public Trust Act 2001 (2001 No 100) by substituting the words ""Public Trust"" for the words ""the Public Trustee"" wherever they occur. _See_ [clause 2][28] [Public Trust Act Commencement Order 2002][29] (SR 2002/11).
    
    In subsection (1)(b) the Administration Act 1969, being the corresponding enactment in force, has been substituted for the repealed Administration Act 1952\.
    
    Subsection (4) was amended, as from 1 March 2002, by section [170(1)][27] Public Trust Act 2001 (2001 No 100) by substituting the word ""it"" for the word ""him"". _See_ [clause 2][28] [Public Trust Act Commencement Order 2002][29] (SR 2002/11).
