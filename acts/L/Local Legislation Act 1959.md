##### 4 Provision with respect to apportionment of general expenses amongst ridings of County of Southland by Southland County Council
    
*   Whereas the County of Southland (in this section referred to as the **County**) comprises 9 ridings: 
    
    And whereas the district valuation rolls for 5 of the said ridings were, pursuant to section 9 of the Valuation of Land Act 1951, revised by the Valuer-General as at 31 January 1956: 
    
    And whereas the district valuation rolls for the remainder of the said ridings were, pursuant to the said section, revised by the Valuer-General as at 31 January 1957:
    
    And whereas the Southland County Council (in this section referred to as the **Council**) for the years ended with 31 March 1957 and 31 March 1958 and 31 March 1959 levied a general rate separately in each such riding:
    
    And whereas subsection (3) of section 134 of the Counties Act 1956 provides that when a general rate is levied separately in each riding the proportion of the general expenses of the County to be borne by each riding shall bear to the total amount of those expenses the same proportion as the rateable value of all the property in the riding bears to the total rateable value of all the property in the County:
    
    And whereas, since the district valuation rolls had been revised as aforesaid as at 2 different dates, the Council, for the purpose of determining the proportion of the general expenses of the County to be borne by each of its 9 ridings, for the years in question, in accordance with subsection (3) of the said section 134, used the values appearing in the district valuation rolls for the whole County as revised by the Valuer-General as at 31 March 1952:
    
    And whereas, doubts having arisen as to the validity of so determining the proportion of the general expenses of the County to be borne by each riding as aforesaid, it is desirable that such doubts be resolved:
    
    And whereas it is desirable that, until the rating year in which the next revision of the district valuation rolls for the ridings in the County is completed, the rateable valuation of the property in the County and in the ridings thereof as appearing in the district valuation rolls for the whole County as at 31 March 1952 be used for determining the proportions in which such ridings are to bear the general expenses of the County:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    (1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Counties Act 1956, the proportion of general expenses of the County borne by each riding thereof for the years ended with 31 March 1957, 31 March 1958 and 31 March 1959 shall be deemed to have been lawfully determined by the Council.
    
    (2) For the year ending with 31 March 1960 and for each subsequent year until the year ending with 31 March in which the next revision of the district valuation rolls of the ridings in the County is completed, the rateable value of the property in the County and in the ridings thereof, as appearing in the district valuation rolls for the whole County as at 31 March 1952 may be used by the Council for determining the proportions in which the said ridings are to bear the general expenses of the County.

    And whereas authority has since been obtained to the raising of the loan:
    
    And whereas the Council has refunded to its County Fund Account out of the proceeds of the loan the sum of 372 pounds 16 shillings:
    
    And whereas the Council had no authority to make such a refund and it is desirable to validate the same:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    The action of the Council in refunding the sum of 372 pounds 16 shillings to its County Fund Account out of the proceeds of the loan is hereby validated and declared to have been lawful.

##### 6 Extending special rating areas in County of Hutt

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][59] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][61] and [17E][62] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
