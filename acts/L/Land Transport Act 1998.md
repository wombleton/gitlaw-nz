    *   (aa) in the case of a person who is apparently younger than 20, the person has undergone a breath screening test under [section 68][165] and it appears to the officer that the breath of the person who underwent the test contains alcohol; or
    
    *   (ab) in the case of any other person, the person has undergone a breath screening test under [section 68][165] and it appears to the officer that the proportion of alcohol in the breath of the person who underwent the test exceeds 400 micrograms of alcohol per litre of breath; or
    
    *   (b) \[Repealed\]

    *   (d) the person could be required to undergo a breath screening test without delay under [section 68][165] but cannot be tested because either a breath screening device is not readily available or for any reason a breath screening test cannot then be carried out, and there is good cause to suspect that the person has consumed drink.
    
    (2) If it is not practicable for a person to undergo an evidential breath test at a place to which the person has accompanied an enforcement officer under subsection (1), an enforcement officer may require the person to accompany the officer to any other place where it is likely that the person can undergo an evidential breath test or a blood test (or both).
    
    (3) For the avoidance of doubt, it is declared that an enforcement officer may require a person to accompany the officer to a place under subsection (1) if---

    *   (a) accompany the officer to a place when required to do so under this section:

    *   (b) the court, having regard to---

    *   (c) in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed on the offender in respect of the offence, the court must take into account the gravity of the offence and the fact that the offender would otherwise have been liable to disqualification from holding or obtaining a driver licence.
    
    (3A) For the purposes of subsection (3)(a), the court may impose a sentence of supervision or intensive supervision as a community-based sentence if---

    *   (b) a suitable programme is available; and
    
    *   (c) the offender attends a suitable programme.
    
    (4) This section does not apply if---
        
    *   (a) [section 63][153] or [section 65][157] applies; or
    
    *   (b) the offender is prohibited from applying for a limited licence under [section 103(2)(a), (b), or (d)][272].

*   (1) A court may at any time make an order under this section authorising the applicant to obtain, immediately or after the expiration of such period as the court may specify, a driver licence (_a limited licence_) authorising the applicant to drive to such extent (being the least extent that it is necessary to alleviate extreme or undue hardship) as the court specifies in the order.
    
    (2) The court may make an order under this section if satisfied that---
        
    *   (a) the disqualification or suspension has resulted or will result in---
            
        *   (i) extreme hardship to the applicant (whether in relation to employment or otherwise); or
        
        *   (ii) undue hardship to a person other than the applicant (whether in relation to employment or otherwise); and
        
        
    
    *   (ab) the applicant meets the criteria specified in [sections 103][272] and [104][273]; and
    
    *   (b) an order under this section is not contrary to the interests of public safety.
    
    (3) In making an order under this section, the court---

    *   (b) may specify in the order such other matters as the court thinks fit.
    
    (4) If the application relates to a disqualification order made by a District Court, the application must be made to a District Court Judge exercising jurisdiction in the court by which the order was made.
    
    (5) If an application under this section is refused,---
        
    *   (a) the court may accept a further application in respect of the same order if satisfied that the application is supported by relevant evidence that was not available when the previous application was heard; but

    *   (b) the person is disqualified from holding or obtaining a driver licence.

    *   (a) decline to issue the limited licence; and
    
    *   (b) refer the applicant to the right of appeal under [section 106][276].
    
    (7) If the holder of a limited licence, or a person who is authorised to obtain a limited licence but has not become the holder of such a licence, is convicted of an offence for which an order of disqualification is imposed,---
        
    *   (a) the limited licence is revoked or may not be issued (as the case may be) and the original order of disqualification is revived and has effect for the balance of the term for which it was originally imposed; and
    
    *   (b) unless the court orders otherwise, the period of disqualification under the revived order of disqualification runs concurrently with the order of disqualification in respect of the second offence.
    
    (7A) If a driver licence stop order takes effect in respect of a person who holds a limited licence or is authorised to obtain a limited licence, then the limited licence---

    *   (b) may, when a driver licence stop order is cancelled under [section 91G][245] or terminated under [section 91H][246], be reissued or issued (as the case may be) unless the person is otherwise disqualified from holding a limited licence.
    
    (8) The holder of a limited licence that is revoked under subsection (7) must immediately, and whether demand is made on the holder or not, surrender his or her photographic driver licence to the court by which he or she is convicted or to an enforcement officer or at an office of the Agency.
