    And whereas it is just and equitable that they should be relieved from such liability:
    
    Be it therefore enacted as follows:

    And whereas a large part of the remainder of the said reclaimed land has been let for the purpose of oil stores, and it is anticipated that the balance of the said reclaimed land will be put to similar uses:
    
    And whereas under the Government Railways Act 1926, siding rights have been granted to the lessees of such oil stores and such sidings are connected with the government railway lines on the Lyttelton waterfront by certain feeder lines running along and over certain streets formed upon such reclaimed land and giving access to such oil stores, and it is contemplated that as and when further parts of such reclaimed land are let and occupied, and further streets giving access thereto are formed, further siding rights will be granted to the lessees of such land and further feeder lines will be laid along and across such streets connecting such sidings with the government railways:

    And whereas the nature of the use of the said reclaimed lands is such as to necessitate the connection with the government railways of the said existing sidings and any sidings for which rights may be granted in the future, and the presence of the said feeder lines upon the said streets will be in keeping with the use to which the said reclaimed lands have been put:
    
    And whereas the Council desires to accept dedication of the said streets with the said feeder lines constructed thereon and to grant to the Board and to all persons to whom siding rights have heretofore been or may hereafter be granted the right to construct and maintain upon the said streets any such feeder lines and sidings:

    Be it therefore enacted as follows:
    
    (1) The Council is hereby authorised to grant to the Board and to all lessees of the Board the right to construct, maintain, and use (upon or subject to such terms as the Council shall consider necessary for the safety of the public) all such railway lines already laid or hereafter to be laid upon any street already formed or to be formed on the said reclaimed lands, and constituting feeder lines or sidings connecting the said lands with the government railways on the Lyttelton waterfront, for such time as the Minister of Railways shall permit such connection with the government railways.
    
    (2) All such feeder lines and sidings shall be constructed and maintained by the Board or its lessees in such manner as shall be approved by the Minister of Railways and the Council, and shall permit of the reasonable use in safety of the said streets by the public, but the fact that the width of any of the said streets available for the traffic of the public is diminished by the presence of such railway lines shall not be deemed to constitute a public nuisance, and it shall be lawful for but not obligatory upon the Board and the Council, or either of them, if they or either of such bodies shall deem it necessary for the public safety, to fence off all or any of such parts of the said feeder lines or sidings as are not constructed level with the surface of the street.

    (2) Every public notice of any resolution to which this section applies shall contain all the particulars referred to in section 10 of the Local Bodies' Loans Act 1926, and in addition shall contain a statement to the effect that a poll of the ratepayers is required to be taken if 5% of the ratepayers of the said district so demand by writing under their hands delivered or sent by post to the Board.

For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][76] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][77] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][78] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][79] and [17E][80] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
