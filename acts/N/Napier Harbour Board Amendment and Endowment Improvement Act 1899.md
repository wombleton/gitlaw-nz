An Act to amend The [Napier Harbour Board Amendment and Endowment Improvement Act 1887][14], and The Napier Harbour Board Amendment and Further Empowering Act 1889, and to give Further Powers to the Napier Harbour Board to deal with the Lands described in the said Acts.
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    WHEREAS it has been found that the powers given to the Napier Harbour Board by The [Napier Harbour Board Amendment and Endowment Improvement Act 1887][14], and The Napier Harbour Board Amendment and Further Empowering Act 1889, are insufficient to provide for the effectual reclamation and improvement of the lands mentioned in the said Act: And whereas it is expedient that such reclamation and improvement of the said lands be carried out, inasmuch as such reclamation and improvement would add materially to the value and productiveness of the said lands, and for such purpose it is expedient that a power to sell portion of the said lands should be given to the Napier Harbour Board, and that more extended powers than are now vested in the said Board of leasing the whole or part of the said lands should be also given to the said Board:

BE IT THEREFORE ENACTED by the General Assembly of New Zealand in Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:---
