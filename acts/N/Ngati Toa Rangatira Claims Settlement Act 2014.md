    (2) [Sections 9][10] and [10][11] record the acknowledgements and the apology given by the Crown to Ngati Toa Rangatira in the deed of settlement.

##### 8 Summary of historical account
    
*   The historical account set out in the deed of settlement is summarised as follows:
    
    (1) By 1840 Ngati Toa Rangatira had established a powerful position in the Cook Strait region with settlements in the lower North Island and upper South Island (Te Tau Ihu). Several Ngati Toa Rangatira chiefs, including Te Rauparaha and Te Rangihaeata, signed the [Treaty of Waitangi][272].
    
    (2) In 1839, Ngati Toa Rangatira signed the Kapiti deed with the New Zealand Company for approximately 20 million acres between Taranaki and north Canterbury. The oral translation of the English deed did not accurately convey its meaning and effect.
    
    (3) Ngati Toa Rangatira opposed Company surveys in the Wairau. In 1843, an attempt by an armed party of Nelson settlers to arrest Te Rauparaha and Te Rangihaeata resulted in a violent clash and the deaths of twenty-two Europeans and up to nine Maori.
    
    (4) A Crown-appointed commissioner investigated the Company's land claims covering Port Nicholson and Te Tau Ihu. In Port Nicholson the Crown established a process by which the Company could validate its purchases by paying additional money to Maori in return for the signing of deeds of release. In 1844 Te Rauparaha accepted £400 for the "surrender" of Ngati Toa Rangatira interests in Harataunga (the Hutt Valley). Te Rangihaeata only accepted a share of the money in 1845 but did not regard this payment as extinguishing the rights of allies from other iwi. The Crown treated the payment, which did not define the boundaries of Harataunga or provide any reserves, as extinguishing Ngati Toa Rangatira interests across the Port Nicholson block.
    
    (5) In 1845 the commissioner recommended that the Company receive a grant of 151 000 acres in Te Tau Ihu. The Wairau was not included in his recommendation. The Crown later established reserves, some of which became known as "tenths" reserves, within the land granted to the Company at Port Nicholson and Nelson. Ngati Toa Rangatira did not receive a share in the "tenths" reserves despite their interests in Port Nicholson and Nelson settlement area.
    
    (6) During 1845, Te Rangihaeata and his section of Ngati Toa Rangatira supported the claims of their allies living on disputed land north of Rotokakahi in the Hutt Valley. These tensions led to several violent incidents between Maori, settlers, and Crown troops. The Crown subsequently took political and military action against Te Rauparaha and Te Rangihaeata in order to establish its authority and reduce the power and influence of the senior Ngati Toa Rangatira chiefs. In July 1846 the Crown seized Te Rauparaha and several other Ngati Toa Rangatira chiefs at Porirua. The Crown detained Te Rauparaha without trial for 18 months. Crown forces pursued Te Rangihaeata who withdrew into Horowhenua.
    
    (7) In 1847, whilst Te Rauparaha was in captivity and Te Rangihaeata in exile, the Crown purchased the Wairau and Porirua districts from several younger Ngati Toa Rangatira chiefs who hoped to secure Te Rauparaha's release. Reserves of over 100 000 acres were set aside in the Wairau and over 10 000 acres in Porirua.
    
    (8) Between 1853 and 1865 the Crown's Te Waipounamu, Whareroa, Wainui, Papakowhai, and Mana Island purchases further reduced the lands remaining in Ngati Toa Rangatira ownership. The Waipounamu deed repurchased nearly all of the large Wairau reserve. Between 1897 and 1911 the Crown, after prohibiting the sale or leasing of Kapiti Island to private interests, bought the majority of Kapiti Island from Ngati Toa Rangatira.
    
    (9) By 1926 most of the Ngati Toa Rangatira reserves at Porirua had been alienated. Ngati Toa Rangatira gifted 500 acres at Whitireia to the Crown for the establishment of a school. When no school was established Ngati Toa Rangatira sought unsuccessfully to have the land returned. In 1948 and 1960 the Crown took several hundred acres of Ngati Toa Rangatira land at Takapuwahia under public works legislation for general housing purposes. Over time, the application of the native land laws led to most of the Porirua reserves being partitioned into smaller subsections. Today Ngati Toa Rangatira are virtually landless.
    
    (10) Porirua harbour, an important food resource for Ngati Toa Rangatira, was adversely affected by pollution and sewage generated by urban development. This has had a severe impact on the ability of Ngati Toa Rangatira to use and protect traditional resources.

##### 9 Text of acknowledgements
    
*   The text of the acknowledgements set out in the deed of settlement is as follows:
    
    (1) The Crown acknowledges that it has failed to deal with the long-standing grievances of Ngati Toa Rangatira in an appropriate way and that recognition of these grievances is long overdue.
    
    (2) The Crown acknowledges that it failed to adequately protect the interests of Ngati Toa Rangatira during the process by which it acquired their interests in the Port Nicholson Block, and this was a breach of Te Tiriti o Waitangi/the [Treaty of Waitangi][272] and its principles.
    
    (3) The Crown acknowledges that the conflict between Ngati Toa Rangatira and European settlers at Tuamarina Stream in June 1843 had a detrimental effect on the relationship between Ngati Toa Rangatira and the Crown and was part of the context of the Crown's Wairau purchase from Ngati Toa Rangatira in 1847\.
    
    (4) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) Te Rauparaha took no direct part in the fighting between Maori and Crown troops in the Hutt Valley prior to his capture by the Crown in July 1846; and
    
    *   (b) its detention of Te Rauparaha for 18 months without trial in 1846--48 assumed the character of indefinite detention without trial and was a breach of Te Tiriti o Waitangi/the [Treaty of Waitangi][272] and its principles.
    
    (5) The Crown acknowledges that in 1846 and 1847 it undermined the power and influence of the key Ngati Toa Rangatira leaders, Te Rauparaha and Te Rangihaeata, by seizing and detaining Te Rauparaha, and pressuring other Ngati Toa Rangatira leaders to agree to the Wairau and Porirua deeds in the absence of Te Rauparaha and Te Rangihaeata. The Crown acknowledges that this was a breach of Te Tiriti o Waitangi/the [Treaty of Waitangi][272] and its principles.
    
    (6) The Crown acknowledges that it failed to adequately protect the interests of Ngati Toa Rangatira and breached Te Tiriti o Waitangi/the [Treaty of Waitangi][272] and its principles when---
        
    *   (a) it failed to ensure sufficient, suitable reserve lands were maintained for the future use and benefit of Ngati Toa Rangatira when the Crown purchased a large amount of land from Ngati Toa Rangatira between 1844 and 1865; and
    
    *   (b) it did not establish timely processes to ensure that Ngati Toa Rangatira obtained an interest in those reserves in the Wellington and Nelson areas that later became known as "tenths" reserves.
    
    (7) The Crown acknowledges that the operation and impact of the native land laws on the remaining lands of Ngati Toa Rangatira, in particular the awarding of land to individual Ngati Toa Rangatira rather than to iwi or hapu, made those lands more susceptible to partition, fragmentation, and alienation. This contributed to the further erosion of the traditional tribal structures of Ngati Toa Rangatira. The Crown failed to take adequate steps to protect those structures and this was a breach of Te Tiriti o Waitangi/the [Treaty of Waitangi][272] and its principles.
    
    (8) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) the Taupo block was originally reserved for Ngati Toa Rangatira from the Crown's Porirua purchase in 1847:
    
    *   (b) despite the Native Land Court ordering in 1881 that a Ngati Toa Rangatira urupa on the Taupo No. 2 block be made "absolutely inalienable" the Crown allowed the urupa to be reduced to one acre in 1896:
    
    *   (c) in the 1920s it was reduced to approximately one-tenth of an acre to make the block available for leasing and development:
    
    *   (d) these actions led to koiwi being reinterred in common graves.
    
    (9) The Crown acknowledges that in 1848 Ngati Toa Rangatira gifted 500 acres of land at Whitireia to the Crown to establish a college. The Crown further acknowledges that Ngati Toa Rangatira sought to regain the land when a college was not constructed, but were unsuccessful in doing so, and that this has remained a significant grievance for Ngati Toa Rangatira to today. The Crown continues to own this land.
    
    (10) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) at 1895 Kapiti Island was one of the last remaining areas of Ngati Toa Rangatira land:
    
    *   (b) Ngati Toa Rangatira strongly objected to legislation promoted by the Crown to acquire Kapiti Island for a nature reserve:
    
    *   (c) the [Kapiti Island Public Reserve Act 1897][273] gave the Crown a monopoly over purchasing land on Kapiti Island:
    
    *   (d) between 1897 and 1911 the Crown purchased the individual interests of the majority of the Ngati Toa Rangatira owners of Kapiti Island.
    
    The Crown acknowledges that the loss of ownership of Kapiti Island has remained a source of grievance and sorrow for Ngati Toa Rangatira.
    
    (11) The Crown acknowledges that during the twentieth century it significantly reduced the lands remaining in Ngati Toa Rangatira ownership for their present and future needs by compulsorily acquiring several hundred acres of land at and around their core settlement at Takapuwahia for housing and public works purposes. The Crown further acknowledges that this land has contributed to the development of the wider Porirua region.
    
    (12) The Crown acknowledges that the cumulative effect of successive Crown purchases of Ngati Toa Rangatira land and the Crown's failure to provide sufficient reserves left Ngati Toa Rangatira virtually landless. The Crown's failure to ensure that Ngati Toa Rangatira retained sufficient land for their present and future needs was a breach of Te Tiriti o Waitangi/the [Treaty of Waitangi][272] and its principles.
    
    (13) The Crown acknowledges that pollution, reclamation, and public works have had a damaging impact on the shellfish and other kai moana resources in the Porirua Harbour, and that the loss of this formerly abundant resource has adversely affected the cultural and spiritual well-being of Ngati Toa Rangatira.

##### 10 Text of apology
    
*   The text of the apology set out in the deed of settlement is as follows:
    
    (1) The Crown recognises that a number of Ngati Toa Rangatira, including Te Rauparaha and Te Rangihaeata, signed Te Tiriti o Waitangi/the [Treaty of Waitangi][272] in 1840\. The Crown profoundly regrets that it has not always lived up to its obligations to Ngati Toa Rangatira under Te Tiriti o Waitangi/the Treaty of Waitangi. Accordingly, the Crown makes this apology to Ngati Toa Rangatira, to their ancestors, and to their descendants.
    
    (2) The Crown unreservedly apologises for the breaches of Te Tiriti o Waitangi/the [Treaty of Waitangi][272] and its principles which have hurt and caused prejudice to Ngati Toa Rangatira. The Crown is deeply sorry for its actions that intentionally undermined the mana and rangatiratanga of leading Ngati Toa Rangatira chiefs. In particular the Crown apologises for its indefinite detention of Te Rauparaha, and deeply regrets that it has failed, until now, to acknowledge this injustice in an appropriate manner.
    
    (3) The Crown profoundly regrets and apologises for its actions that left Ngati Toa Rangatira with few landholdings by 1865, and its ongoing failure to protect their remaining landholdings, which has left Ngati Toa Rangatira virtually landless and unable to access customary resources and significant sites.
    
    (4) The Crown deeply regrets the cumulative effect of its actions and omissions which severely damaged Ngati Toa Rangatira social and traditional tribal structures, their autonomy and ability to exercise customary rights and responsibilities, their capacity for economic and social development, and physical, cultural, and spiritual well-being.
    
    (5) With this apology and settlement the Crown seeks to atone for these wrongs, restore its tarnished honour and begin the process of healing. The Crown hopes that this apology and settlement will mark the beginning of a new, positive, and enduring relationship with Ngati Toa Rangatira founded on mutual trust and co-operation and respect for Te Tiriti o Waitangi/the [Treaty of Waitangi][272] and its principles.

##### 176 Licensed property ceases to be Crown forest land

    (2) However, although the licensed property does not cease to be Crown forest land until the transfer to the trustee is registered, neither the Crown nor any court or tribunal may do any thing or omit to do any thing if that act or omission would, between the settlement date and the date of registration, be---
        
    *   (a) permitted by the [Crown Forest Assets Act 1989][403]; but
    
    *   (b) inconsistent with part 6 of the deed of settlement.
    
    

##### 177 Trustee confirmed beneficiary and licensor in relation to licensed property
    
*   (1) The trustee of the Toa Rangatira Trust is, in relation to a licensed property, the confirmed beneficiary under clause 11.1 of the Crown forestry rental trust deed.

    (3) Despite subsection (2)(a), the trustee of the Toa Rangatira Trust, and the trustees of the related settlement trusts for Ngāti Kōata, Ngāti Rārua, Ngāti Tama ki Te Tau Ihu, and Te Ātiawa o Te Waka-a-Māui, are entitled to the rental proceeds referred to in subsection (2)(a) for all of the licensed properties as provided for in---
        
    *   (a) clause 6.22 of the deed of settlement for Ngati Toa Rangatira:

    (4) The Crown must give notice in accordance with [section 17(4)(b)][404] of the Crown Forest Assets Act 1989 in respect of each relevant Crown forestry licence, even though the Waitangi Tribunal has not made recommendations under [section 8HB(1)(a)][405] of the Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975 for the return of the 1 or more licensed properties to which the licence applies.
    
    (5) Notice given by the Crown under subsection (4) has effect as if---
        
    *   (a) the Waitangi Tribunal had made recommendations under [section 8HB(1)(a)][405] of the Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975 for the return of each licensed property; and
    
    *   (b) the recommendations had become final on the settlement date.
    
    (6) The trustee of the Toa Rangatira Trust is the licensor under the relevant Crown forestry licence in relation to a licensed property as if the property had been returned to Māori ownership---
        
    *   (a) on the settlement date; and
    
    *   (b) under [section 36][406] of the Crown Forest Assets Act 1989\.
    
    (7) However, [section 36(1)(b)][406] of the Crown Forest Assets Act 1989 does not apply to a licensed property.

##### 178 Effect of transfer of licensed property
    
*   (1) [Section 177][217] applies whether or not---

    *   (b) the processes described in clause 17.4 of the relevant Crown forestry licence have been completed.
    
    (2) To the extent that the Crown has not completed the processes referred to in subsection (1)(b) before the settlement date, it must continue those processes---

    (3) Subsection (4) provides for the licence fee payable for a property under the relevant Crown forestry licence---
        
    *   (a) for the period starting on the settlement date until the completion of the processes referred to in subsections (1) and (2) for the 1 or more licensed properties to which the licence applies; and
    
    *   (b) that is not part of the rental proceeds referred to in [section 177(2)(a)][217].
    
    (4) The licence fee payable is the amount calculated in the manner described in paragraphs 2.14 and 2.15 of the property redress schedule of the deed of settlement.
    
    (5) However, the calculation under subsection (4) of the licence fee payable is overridden by any agreement between the licensors and the licensee of the relevant Crown forestry licence.
    
    (6) With effect on and from the settlement date, references to the prospective proprietors in clause 17.4 of the relevant Crown forestry licence must, in relation to a licensed property, be read as if they were references to the trustee of the Toa Rangatira Trust.
    
    (7) Subsections (8) and (9) apply if, in completing the processes described in clause 17.4 of the relevant Crown forestry licence for a licensed property, the balance of the land referred to in clause 17.4.1 of the licence is to be transferred as another licensed property under the deed of settlement for Ngāti Tama ki Te Tau Ihu or Te Ātiawa o Te Waka-a-Māui (instead of being retained by the Crown).
    
    (8) The interests of the trustees to whom the balance is to be transferred replace the interests of the Crown in respect of the balance of the land in clause 17.4.1 of the relevant Crown forestry licence, and those trustees must be treated as if they were another set of prospective proprietors under clause 17.4 of the licence.
    
    (9) The separate licence for the balance of the land referred to in clause 17.4.3 of the relevant Crown forestry licence must include clauses similar to clauses 16.3 to 16.9 of the licence, as described in clause 17.4.4\.
