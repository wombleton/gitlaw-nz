An Act---
    
*   (a) to provide for East Coast Permanent Trustees Limited to continue in existence under the name New Zealand Permanent Trustees Limited; and

*   (b) to authorise the Company to transact business with The National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Limited and with other subsidiaries and related companies of that company; and

*   (c) to repeal the East Coast Permanent Trustees Limited Act 1962

*   #### Preamble
    
    Whereas---
        
    *   A East Coast Permanent Trustees Limited was duly incorporated under the name East Coast Perpetual Trustees Limited on 17 June 1929 as a private company under the Companies Act 1908 and on 7 November 1929 the name of the Company was changed to East Coast Permanent Trustees Limited:
    
    *   B the Company is authorised by its Memorandum of Association and by the East Coast Permanent Trustees Limited Act 1962 to act as executor and trustee and in various other fiduciary capacities and has from the date of its incorporation carried on and now carries on trustee company, trust, and agency business:
    
    *   C the Company is a trustee company under and within the meaning of the [Trustee Companies Act 1967][21] and carries on the business of a trustee company:
    
    *   D all the shares in the Company are now held by or on behalf of Sanduka Holdings Limited, a private company incorporated under the Companies Act 1955:
    
    *   E Sanduka Holdings Limited has agreed, subject to the passing of this Act, to transfer the shares in the Company to The National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Limited, a company incorporated in Victoria, Australia, and having its principal place of business in New Zealand at Wellington (hereinafter called ""NMLA""):
    
    *   F the Company wishes to change its name to New Zealand Permanent Trustees Limited:
    
    *   G The Company wishes to be able to transact with NMLA or any subsidiary or related company of NMLA, should it think fit to do so, any business in connection with any estate or trust property that the Company may from time to time administer:
    
    *   H the East Coast Permanent Trustees Limited Act 1962 contains provisions which are no longer appropriate to the business of the Company:
    
    *   I legislation is the only expedient means by which the name of the Company can be changed and the Company empowered to transact business with NMLA and subsidiaries and related companies of NMLA efficiently and economically without interference to the conduct and continuity of the Company, the trusts under its administration, the clients of the Company, and persons having business with the Company:
    
    *   J legislation is necessary to repeal The East Coast Permanent Trustees Limited Act 1962:
    
    *   K the objects of this Act cannot be attained otherwise than by legislation.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the New Zealand Permanent Trustees Limited Act 1991\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 March 2002, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][28] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][29] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][30] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][31] and [17E][32] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
