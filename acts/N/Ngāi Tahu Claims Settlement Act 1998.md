An Act---
    
*   (a) to record the apology given by the Crown to Ngāi Tahu in the deed of settlement executed on 21 November 1997 by the then Prime Minister the Right Honourable James Brendan Bolger, for the Crown, and Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu; and

*   (b) to give effect to certain provisions of that deed of settlement, being a deed that settles the Ngāi Tahu claims

*   #### Preamble
    
    ##### He kōrero tāhuhu
    
    ###### He kōrero tāhuhu
    
    A E mau ake nei te Rārangi Tāpiri Tuatahi mō tēnei ture, e whakaupoko ana i roto i te reo Māori me te reo Pākehā i ngā tikanga o [Te Tiriti o Waitangi][560]:
    
    ##### Ngā tātai
    
    ###### Te Whakawhitinga o ngā whenua o Ngāi Tahu
    
    B Ka hainatia [Te Tiriti o Waitangi][560] e Ngāi Tahu i te tau 1840 ki Akaroa (30 o ngā rā o Matahi), ki te motu o Ruapuke (9, 10 o ngā rā o Maruaroa), me Ōtākou hoki (13 o ngā rā o Maruaroa). Ko Ngāi Tahu te tāngata whenua o te rohe i whakapuakitia anotia e Te Ture o Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu 1996 i taua wā, ā, tae noa ki tēnei wā. I roto i ngā tau o muri mai o te hainatanga o Te Tiriti o Waitangi ka whai ngā mōkai a te Karauna kia whakawhitia atu e Ngāi Tahu ō rātou whenua ki te Karauna. Nā ngā hoko nunui tekau katoa aua hoko---i oti atu ai ngā whenua o Ngāi Tahu ki te Karauna, arā: Ōtākou 1844, Canterbury (tā Kemp) 1848, Port Cooper 1849, Port Levy 1849, Murihiku 1853, Akaroa 1856, North Canterbury 1857, Kaikōura 1859, Arahura 1860, me Rakiura 1864\. Ngā ingoa o ngā kaihaina o Ngāi Tahu i ngā pukapuka ā-herenga kei roto i te Rārangi Tāpiri Tuarua, arā he mea tuhi ki roto i te Tāpiri Tuarua o te rīpoata a Te Rōpū Whakamana i te Tiriti mō Ngāi Tahu i te tau 1991:
    
    ###### Te Roanga o te tatari a Ngāi Tahu kia arotia mai ā rātou whakamau
    
    C Mai rā anō a Ngāi Tahu e rangahau ana i te ""Kerēme"" mō te huhunu o ngā mahi a te Karauna arā, mō te kore a te Karauna e whai whakaaro ki ngā tohutohu o roto i ngā pukapuka ā-herenga i roto i ā rātou hokonga mai i ngā whenua o Ngāi Tahu. Ko ngā tāngata rongonui nā rātou i kawe te ""Kerēme"" mai rā anō ko Matiaha Tiramōrehu, Hori Kerei Taiaroa, Tiemi Hipi, Tipene O'Regan, Henare Rakiihia Tau, me ā rātou whānau:
    
    D Nā te tukunga iho o ngā mahi tautohe me ngā tono a Ngāi Tahu (ko ētahi o aua tono i tīmatatia mai i roto i ngā tau 1840), kātahi ka tirotirohia e ngā kaiwhakahaere a te Karauna. Ko ētahi o aua kaiwhakahaere i whakahāwea noa iho ki ngā take i tirohia e rātou, ēngari ko ētahi i āta wherawhera i ngā take ka kitea e rātou te tika o ngā whakamau a Ngāi Tahu. E whakaae ana te Karauna tērā, kāore ia i aro atu ki aua whakamau, otirā, kāore ia i whakatau i te ""Kerēme"" o Ngāi Tahu. Ko te ture i whakaritea i te tau 1944 ko te Ngāitahu Claim Settlement Act kāore rawa i kōrerotia i waenganui i ngā iwi i mua o te whakaturenga, ēngari kāore i purua ngā tono a te iwi ki te Karauna:
    
    ###### Tono i raro i te Ture o [Te Tiriti o Waitangi 1975][560]
    
    E I roto i ngā whakaturenga o te ture āpiti 1985 o [Te Tiriti o Waitangi][560], ka whakawāteatia mai e te Karauna he huanui e āhei ai te Māori ki te mau atu i ā rātou take uaua ko mua i Te Rōpū Whakamana i Te Tiriti mō ngā whakamau puri mahara i pūtake mai i te rā o te hainatanga o Te Tiriti o Waitangi, 1840:
    
    F I te 26 o ngā rā o Whā, 1986 ka whakatakototia e Henare Rakiihia Tau rāua ko Te Poari Māori o Ngāi Tahu---te reo o te iwi o Ngāi Tahu---tā rātou take ki mua i Te Rōpū Whakamana i Te Tiriti. Ko Tipene O'Regan te tumuaki o te Poari. Nō muri iho ka āta whakamāramatia ngā āhuatanga o taua take ki roto i ngā āpiti:
    
    G Ko te take o Ngāi Tahu---Wai 27---i rēhitatia ki Te Rōpū Whakamana i Te Tiriti, i āta tirotirohia i te wā o te whakawātanga ki mua i Te Rōpū Whakamana i Te Tiriti i roto i ngā tau mai i 1987 ki 1989:
    
    H I te tuatahi o ngā rā o Kahuru 1991, ka puta te rīpoata a Te Rōpū Whakamana i Te Tiriti e whakaatu ana i ngā tino kaupapa o te take o Ngāi Tahu i āta mōhiotia nei ko ngā ""Rākau Teitei e Iwa"" o ngā whakamau a Ngāi Tahu, nā, i te 6 o ngā rā o Rima 1991, ka puta anō he rīpoata e tūtohu ana tērā me hanga he ture kia taea ai e Ngāi Tahu te whakarite i tētahi rūnanganui-ā-iwi hei kanohi mō rātou, arā, mō Ngāi Tahu Whānui:
    
    I I te 6 o ngā rā o Whā 1992, ka puta te rīpoata ā Te Rōpū Whakamana i Te Tiriti mō te take o Te Hī-Ika o Ngāi Tahu, ā, ka kitea ""Neke atu ki tētahi rau tau, i whakararurarutia a Ngāi Tahu e te roa o te kore whai tohutohu i roto i [Te Tiriti o Waitangi][560] tae mai ki te wā o te whakaturetanga me te whakakaupapatanga o te Quota Management System"". Nō muri iho i whakatauria aua take ki ngā whakataunga i roto i te Māori Fisheries Act 1989, te whakaaetanga ā-pukapuka i waenganui i a te iwi Māori me te Karauna i te 23 o ngā rā o te Rima 1992, me te [Treaty of Waitangi (Fisheries Claims) Settlement Act 1992][677]:
    
    J Ko te 27 o ngā rā o Kahuru-kai-paeka 1995, ka puta te roanga atu o te rīpoata a Te Rōpū Whakamana i Te Tiriti mō te taha ki ngā take tāpiri a Ngāi Tahu:
    
    ###### Ko ngā whiriwhiringa a Te Rōpū Whakamana i Te Tiriti: Ngā Rākau Teitei e Iwa
    
    K I roto i ngā whiriwhiringa a Te Rōpū Whakamana i Te Tiriti i ngā take o Ngāi Tahu ka kitea te tika o te nuinga o aua take, otirā, ngā take i pā atu ki ngā ""Rākau Teitei e Iwa"" me ngā wāhanga tāpiringa. Ka mahara Te Rōpū Whakamana i Te Tiriti tērā, mai rā anō kāore rawa i a te Karauna i ngākau pono ki ōna whakaaetanga, i roto i Te Tiriti, i a Ngāi Tahu. Ka mahara hoki Te Rōpū Whakamana i Te Tiriti tērā, i te aponga a te Karauna i ngā whenua o Ngāi Tahu---34.5 miriona eka mō te iti noa iho o te utu, £14,750---i takakino tāruaruatia e ia te kaupapa ōritenga o [Te Tiriti o Waitangi][560]. Ka whakataua e Te Rōpū Whakamana i Te Tiriti tērā, nā aua takakino a te Karauna i pōharatia ai a Ngāi Tahu i ō rātou whenua, i kore ai rātou i whai oranga rite atu ki ngā āhuatanga i mua i te aponga a te Karauna i ō rātou whenua:
    
    L Ka tohua e Te Rōpū Whakamana i Te Tiriti i roto i ā rātou whiriwhiringa, te āhua me nui o te utu a te Karauna mō āna haranga ki a Ngāi Tahu. Ka whakaarotia e Te Rōpū Whakamana i Te Tiriti me whakahoki atu e te Karauna kia rawaka he whenua mō Ngāi Tahu kia whai oranga ai rātou i ngā hua whenua me tēnei whakatupuranga atu ki ngā uri kei te heke iho:
    
    M _Ōtākou_
    
    Ka kitea e Te Rōpū Whakamana i Te Tiriti tērā, i raro i ngā āhuatanga i whakaaetia i te wā o te hokonga a te Karauna i Ōtākou kāore ia te Karauna, i ngākau pono ki aua āhuatanga, tērā, kāore i tāpiritia atu e ia he whenua hei hui atu ki tērā i rāhuitia mō Ngāi Tahu. Ka whakaarotia e Te Rōpū Whakamana i Te Tiriti mehemea pea i hanga he ture e te Karauna e taea ai e ia te tākoha whenua ""te kau o rau"" ki a Ngāi Tahu, ka ea pea tētahi wāhanga o ōna hara:
    
    _Ngā Pākihi Whakatekateka o Waitaha_
    
    I kitea e Te Rōpū Whakamana i [Te Tiriti o Waitangi][560], tērā te Karauna i tāna hokonga i ngā whenua o Ngāi Tahu, arā, i Ngā Pākihi Whakatekateka o Waitaha, kāore i ōrite ngā whiriwhiringa kāore i tutuki ngā hinonga mō te rāhui kia rāwaka he wāhi mahinga kai mā Ngāi Tahu mō nāianei, ā, mō ngā rā hoki kei te heke iho. Kāore i wehea ake e te Karauna ngā whenua, i tonoa e Ngāi Tahu i te takiwā mai i te awa o Waimakariri atu ki te awa o Kāwari. I kitea e Te Rōpū Whakamana i Te Tiriti o Waitangi tērā, i runga i ēnei takakino, i tino hē te Karauna ki mua i a Ngāi Tahu:
    
    _Horomaka_
    
    I kitea e Te Rōpū Whakamana i Te Tiriti tērā, i tukua e te Karauna 30,000 eka ki te Nanto-Bordelaise Company i Horomaka tērā, kāore a Ngāi Tahu i whakaae ki te tuku i te katoa o aua whenua. I roto i ngā tikanga kūare a te Karauna kāore a Ngāi Tahu i utua mō aua whenua, kāore hoki i tika ngā whakarite mō ngā whenua i Whakaraupō me Koukourarata. Tēnā atu anō ētahi o ngā hē o te Karauna i kitea e Te Rōpū Whakamana i Te Tiriti, arā, ko te kore o te Karauna i whakaae ki te rāhui i ētahi whenua i tonoa e Ngāi Tahu i Ōkeina me Whakaroi. I kitea e Te Rōpū Whakamana i Te Tiriti tērā, kua hokona kētia ngā whenua i Horomaka e te Karauna i mua o te hokonga mai o aua whenua i a Ngāi Tahu, kore rawa i whakaaro ake i mahara rānei ki te wehe ake i ētahi whenua mō ngā uri whakatupu o Ngāi Tahu:
    
    _Murihiku_
    
    I kitea e Te Rōpū Whakamana i [Te Tiriti o Waitangi][560] tērā, i te hokonga mai a te Karauna i Murihiku kāore i wehea ake ngā whenua i tonoa e Ngāi Tahu kia rāhuitia, kāore i tohua he aronga atu ki ngā wāhi mahinga kai, kāore i wehea kia rāwaka he whenua hei whai oranga mō Ngāi Tahu mō nāianei, ā, atu hoki mō ngā uri whakatupu. I kitea anō e Te Rōpū Whakamana i Te Tiriti o Waitangi tērā, i roto i aua mahi hē, i roto hoki i ngā hēanga o muri mai, arā, i te korenga o ngā ture Middle Island Half-Caste Crown Grants Act 1877 me South Island Landless Natives Act 1906 i whakaarahia hei whakatika i aua hē, i tino hara te Karauna ki a Ngāi Tahu:
    
    _North Canterbury me Kaikōura_
    
    I kitea e Te Rōpū Whakamana i [Te Tiriti o Waitangi][560] tērā, i tino whakararurarutia e te Karauna ngā pānga me te rangatiratanga o Ngāi Tahu ki ōna whenua i North Canterbury me Kaikōura i te hē o ngā mahi hoko whenua mai a te Karauna pērā i te hokonga mai o ngā whenua o Wairau 1847, ā, i te hokonga atu hoki o ngā whenua o Ngāi Tahu kāore rā anō kia whakaaetia kia hokona. I kitea e Te Rōpū Whakamana i Te Tiriti o Waitangi tērā, kāore i ōrite ngā mahi a te Karauna i te wā o te whakaritenga o ngā hoko o ngā whenua o Ngāi Tahu o muri mai, kāore i rāwaka ngā whenua i rāhuitia i North Canterbury me Kaikōura hei whai oranga mō Ngāi Tahu mō nāianei, ā, atu hoki mō ngā uri whakatupu:
    
    _Arahura_
    
    I kitea e Te Rōpū Whakamana i [Te Tiriti o Waitangi][560] tērā, kāore i ōrite ngā whakaritenga mō ngā whenua i Arahura, kāore i wehea ake ngā whenua i taunahatia e Ngāi Tahu mō rātou, kāore i wehea ake he ara hei huarahi atu ki ā rātou wāhi mahinga kai. I kitea tērā kāore i whakamarumarutia e te Karauna te tika o Ngāi Tahu ki te pupuri motuhake i tōna mana ki te katoa o ā rātou papa pounamu. I kitea e Te Rōpū Whakamana i Te Tiriti o Waitangi te huakore o ngā mahi a te Karauna tērā kāore i aro ake ki ngā hiahia o Ngāi Tahu i te wā o te whakatakotoranga o ngā tikanga mō ngā rīhi mutunga-kore ki runga i ngā whenua rāhui o Ngāi Tahu:
    
    _Rakiura_
    
    I kitea e Te Rōpū Whakamana i [Te Tiriti o Waitangi][560] tērā, i whakawhitiria a Ngāi Tahu i te takaroa o te Karauna ki te whakatakoto i ngā āhuatanga mō te hoko o Rakiura, ka huakore noa o āna mahi kāore i āta pono te tiaki i ngā pānga o ngā Māori:
    
    _Mahinga kai_
    
    I kitea e Te Rōpū Whakamana i [Te Tiriti o Waitangi][560] tērā, i te hokonga mai a te Karauna i ngā whenua o Ngāi Tahu kāore i hua he āhuatanga e whai huarahi atu ai te iwi ki ā rātou māra kai me ngā moana mahinga tuna arā, a Te Waihora me Wairewa:
    
    _Ngā kura me ngā hōhipera_
    
    I kitea e Te Rōpū Whakamana i [Te Tiriti o Waitangi][560] tērā he tinihanga noa iho ngā kī taurangi a te Karauna i mea ai ia ka whakaratoa e ia ngā tūmanako a Ngāi Tahu, arā, ka mahia e te Karauna he kura, he hōhipera mā Ngāi Tahu, ka kitea tērā, he poapoa kē nā te Karauna kia hokona atu ai e Ngāi Tahu te Kemp Block me Murihiku, tērā, nā te pūturituri o te Karauna ki te whakarato i aua painga i whakawhitiria a Ngāi Tahu:
    
    ###### Ngā Whakaritenga i waenga i a Ngāi Tahu rāua ko te Karauna
    
    N I te tau 1990 ka whakaritea e te Karauna rāua ko Ngāi Tahu he whakaaetanga mō te wā o āianei he maru mō ngā whenua tūwhene a te Karauna mō ngā whakataunga o ngā kerēme ā muri i a Ngāi Tahu:
    
    O E whakaae ana te Karauna ki te wero a Te Rōpū Whakamana i [Te Tiriti o Waitangi][560] i puta i roto i tā rātou rīpoata, nā, te tukunga iho o taua whakaaetanga, Rima 1991, ka whāia e rāua ko Ngāi Tahu he āhuatanga e taea ai te whakatau i ngā amuamu a Ngāi Tahu:
    
    P I te wā mai i 1991 atu ki 1994, ka whāia e te Karauna rāua ko Ngāi Tahu tētahi huarahi e taea ai te whakarite i ngā whakataunga:

    ##### Background in English
    
    A The Treaty of Waitangi is set out, in Māori and English, in [Schedule 1][560]:
    
    ##### The threads of time
    
    ###### Transfer of Ngāi Tahu lands
    
    B The [Treaty of Waitangi][560] was signed by Ngāi Tahu in 1840 at Akaroa (May 30), Ruapuke Island (June 9, 10), and Ōtākou (June 13). Ngāi Tahu is today, and was at the time of the signing of the Treaty, the tāngata whenua within the boundaries already confirmed in [Te Runanga o Ngai Tahu Act 1996][678]. In the years following the signing of the Treaty, the Crown, through its representatives and agents, sought the transfer of land from the Ngāi Tahu people to the Crown. This was achieved through 10 major purchases: Ōtākou 1844, Canterbury (Kemp's) 1848, Port Cooper 1849, Port Levy 1849, Murihiku 1853, Akaroa 1856, North Canterbury 1857, Kaikōura 1859, Arahura 1860, and Rakiura 1864\. The Ngāi Tahu signatories to these deeds, as recorded in Appendix 2 of the Waitangi Tribunal's Ngai Tahu Report 1991, are listed in [Schedule 2][561]:
    
    ###### Ngāi Tahu have long sought to have their grievances redressed
    
    C From an early date, Ngāi Tahu has pursued claims against the Crown of unfair purchase practices and of breaches of the deeds of purchase. Matiaha Tiramōrehu, Hori Kerei Taiaroa, Tiemi Hipi, Tipene O'Regan, and Henare Rakiihia Tau and their wives and families were most prominent in these claims:
    
    D As a result of Ngāi Tahu petitions and protests, some dating back to the 1840s, Ngāi Tahu's grievances have been considered by a number of inquiries. Some dismissed them after cursory investigation, but those which investigated in detail generally found validity in Ngāi Tahu's complaints. However, the Crown accepts that Ngāi Tahu's grievances were not remedied. In particular, the Ngaitahu Claim Settlement Act 1944 was enacted without prior consultation with the tribe and did not debar the tribe from further pursuing its claim:
    
    ###### Claim under the [Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975][679]
    
    E Through enactment of the Treaty of Waitangi Amendment Act 1985, the Crown made it possible for Māori to bring claims before the Waitangi Tribunal in respect of historic grievances arising after 6 February 1840:
    
    F On 26 August 1986, a claim was submitted to the Waitangi Tribunal by Henare Rakiihia Tau and the Ngāi Tahu Māori Trust Board, which represented the Ngāi Tahu iwi and was chaired by Tipene O'Regan. That claim was subsequently elaborated upon by way of several amendments:
    
    G The Ngāi Tahu claim, registered with the Waitangi Tribunal as Wai 27, was investigated in hearings before the Tribunal over the years 1987 to 1989:
    
    H On 1 February 1991, the Waitangi Tribunal reported on the main elements of the Ngāi Tahu claim, described collectively as the ""Nine Tall Trees"" of Ngāi Tahu's grievances, and on 6 September 1991 issued a supplementary report recommending the creation by statute of a representative tribal body for Ngāi Tahu:
    
    I On 6 August 1992, the Waitangi Tribunal reported on the Ngāi Tahu Sea Fisheries claim, finding that ""Ngai Tahu has for more than a century been seriously prejudiced by long-standing breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi culminating in the enactment and implementation of the Quota Management System"". Those claims were subsequently settled through the settlement embodied in the Maori Fisheries Act 1989, the Deed of Settlement dated 23 September 1992 between the Crown and Māori and the [Treaty of Waitangi (Fisheries Claims) Settlement Act 1992][677]:
    
    J The Waitangi Tribunal made a further report on 27 April 1995 in respect of Ngāi Tahu's Ancillary Claims:
    
    ###### Findings of the Tribunal: The ""Nine Tall Trees""
    
    K After considering the elements of the Ngāi Tahu claim, the Waitangi Tribunal found substantially in Ngāi Tahu's favour, both in relation to the elements referred to as the ""Nine Tall Trees"", and to the Ancillary Claims. In particular, the Tribunal could not reconcile the Crown's enduring failure to meet its obligations to Ngāi Tahu with its duty to act towards its Treaty partner reasonably and with the utmost good faith. The Tribunal also emphasised that, in acquiring some 34.5 million acres of land from Ngāi Tahu for £14,750, the Crown acted unconscionably and in repeated breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi][560]. The Tribunal considered that the Crown's actions left Ngāi Tahu with insufficient land to maintain its way of life, and to enable the tribe's full participation in subsequent economic development:
    
    L The Tribunal indicated in general terms the nature and scope of the redress which Ngāi Tahu ought properly to receive. The Tribunal considered that the Crown ought to have restored to Ngāi Tahu sufficient land to provide for the future economic, social, and cultural development of the tribe:
    
    M _Ōtākou_
    
    The Tribunal found that the Crown was under a residual obligation to make further provision for Ngāi Tahu, in addition to the reserves agreed upon during the purchase of the Ōtākou Block, and that the Crown failed to satisfy this obligation. The Tribunal considered that the Crown's obligation might have been satisfied by the creation of ""Tenths"", or by other adequate provision:
    
    _Canterbury_
    
    The Tribunal found that the Crown, in acquiring the Canterbury Block, failed to negotiate fairly, failed to meet its undertaking to reserve sufficient food resources for Ngāi Tahu, and failed to meet its obligation to provide ample reserves for the existing and future needs of Ngāi Tahu. The Crown did not set aside the area defined by the Waimakariri and Kāwari Rivers, as requested by Ngāi Tahu. The Tribunal found that, in so acting, and in its subsequent failure to remedy these faults, the Crown breached its duty to act with the utmost good faith towards Ngāi Tahu:
    
    _Banks Peninsula_
    
    The Tribunal found that the Crown granted the Nanto-Bordelaise Company an interest in 30,000 acres of land on Banks Peninsula, that Ngāi Tahu had not agreed to relinquish most of this land and was not compensated for its loss, and that the Crown used high-handed and unfair methods in its dealings with Ngāi Tahu over the Port Cooper and Port Levy Blocks. Significant to the Tribunal's findings on the Port Levy Purchase was the Crown's refusal to make reserves, as requested by Ngāi Tahu, at Okains Bay, Kaituna Valley and Pigeon Bay. The Tribunal further found that the Crown had dealt with land on Banks Peninsula before it had been lawfully acquired from Ngāi Tahu and that the Crown failed to meet its obligation to provide ample reserves for the existing and future needs of Ngāi Tahu:
    
    _Murihiku_
    
    The Tribunal found that the Crown, in purchasing the Murihiku Block, failed to set aside reserves that were requested by Ngāi Tahu, failed to preserve for Ngāi Tahu reasonable access to food resources, and failed to ensure that Ngāi Tahu retained sufficient land for its existing and future needs. The Tribunal found that, in so acting, and in its subsequent failure to remedy these faults through the Middle Island Half-Caste Crown Grants Act 1877 and South Island Landless Natives Act 1906, the Crown breached its duty to act with the utmost good faith towards Ngāi Tahu:
    
    _North Canterbury and Kaikōura_
    
    The Tribunal found that Ngāi Tahu's interests and rangatiratanga in the North Canterbury and Kaikōura Blocks were gravely prejudiced by the Crown's transactions with other tribes, particularly in the Wairau Purchase of 1847, and by the Crown's disposal of land without Ngāi Tahu's consent. It found that the Crown failed both to act fairly and honourably in negotiating for the subsequent purchase of Ngāi Tahu's interests, and to provide sufficient reserves in the North Canterbury and Kaikōura Blocks for the existing and future needs of Ngāi Tahu:
    
    _Arahura_
    
    The Tribunal found that the Crown did not act fairly in its negotiations for the Arahura Block, and that the Crown failed both to set aside certain areas that Ngāi Tahu wished to retain, and to preserve for Ngāi Tahu reasonable access to food resources. It found that the Crown failed to protect the right of Ngāi Tahu to retain possession and control of all pounamu. The Tribunal also found that the Crown failed to respect Ngāi Tahu's interests and wishes when enacting a system of perpetual leases over Ngāi Tahu reserves:
    
    _Rakiura_
    
    The Tribunal found that Ngāi Tahu was disadvantaged by the delay in implementing the terms of the Rakiura purchase, the Crown having failed in its duty actively to protect Māori interests:
    
    _Mahinga kai_
    
    The Tribunal found that, when purchasing Ngāi Tahu lands, the Crown failed to ensure that Ngāi Tahu retained reasonable access to places where the tribe produced or procured food, and especially unimpeded access to Lakes Waihora and Wairewa:
    
    _Schools and hospitals_
    
    The Tribunal found that the expectation of being provided with schools and hospitals was an inducement to Ngāi Tahu in selling the Kemp and Murihiku Blocks, that the Crown failed to act promptly to provide these benefits, and that Ngāi Tahu was disadvantaged by the delay in meeting its expectations:
    
    ###### Negotiations between Ngāi Tahu and the Crown
    
    N In 1990, the Crown entered into an interim agreement with Ngāi Tahu to safeguard surplus Crown lands for the future settlement of Ngāi Tahu's claims:
    
    O The Crown accepted the thrust of the 1991 Waitangi Tribunal report, and, in consequence of that acceptance, in September 1991 the Crown and Ngāi Tahu entered into negotiations to seek resolution of the Ngāi Tahu grievances:
    
    P During the period 1991 to 1994, the Crown and Ngāi Tahu endeavoured to negotiate a settlement:
    
    Q Following the passing of the [Te Runanga o Ngai Tahu Act 1996][678], Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu, as defined in that Act, is recognised for all purposes as the representative of Ngāi Tahu Whānui pursuant to [section 15][680] of that Act:
    
    R In 1996, the Crown and Ngāi Tahu negotiated in good faith in a further attempt to achieve a full and final settlement of Ngāi Tahu's historic Treaty claims and to remove the continuing sense of grievance felt by Ngāi Tahu:
    
    S On 14 June 1996, the Crown and Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu entered into a Deed of ""On Account"" Settlement, pursuant to which the Crown agreed to provide certain redress to Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu on an ""on account"" basis as a sign of good faith and a demonstration of the Crown's goodwill:
    
    T On 5 October 1996, the Crown and Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu entered into a heads of agreement to record on a without prejudice basis the matters which they had agreed in principle should be contained in a deed of settlement to effect a settlement of Ngāi Tahu's claims and their agreement to negotiate in good faith to settle the terms of the deed of settlement:
    
    ###### Settlement of claim
    
    U On 21 November 1997, the Crown and Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu entered into the deed of settlement in which the Crown acknowledged that Ngāi Tahu suffered grave injustices which significantly impaired Ngāi Tahu's economic, social and cultural development and which recorded the matters required to give effect to a settlement of all of Ngāi Tahu's historical claims.

## Part 1  
Apology by the Crown to Ngāi Tahu

##### 4 Apology
    
*   This Part records the apology given by the Crown to Ngāi Tahu in the deed of settlement.

##### 5 Text in Māori
    
*   The text of the apology in Māori is as follows:
    
    > *   "1 Kei te mōhio te Karauna i te tino roa o ngā tūpuna o Ngāi Tahu e totohe ana kia utu mai rātou e te Karauna---tata atu ki 150 ngā tau i puta ai tēnei pēpeha a Ngāi Tahu arā: "'He mahi kai tākata, he mahi kai hoaka'". Nā te whai mahara o ngā tūpuna o Ngāi Tahu ki ngā āhuatanga o ngā kawenga a te Karauna i kawea ai e Matiaha Tiramōrehu tana petihana ki a Kuini Wikitoria i te tau 1857\. I tuhia e Tiramōrehu tana petihana arā:
    >     
    >     'Koia nei te whakahau a tōu aroha i whiua e koe ki runga i ēnei kāwana... tērā kia whakakotahitia te ture, kia whakakotahitia ngā whakahau, kia ōrite ngā āhuatanga mō te kiri mā kia rite ki tō te kiri waitutu, me te whakatakoto i te aroha o tōu ngākau pai ki runga i te iwi Māori kia noho ngākau pai tonu ai rātou me te mau mahara tonu ki te mana o tōu ingoa.'
    >     
    >     Nā konei te Karauna i whakaae ai tērā, te taumaha o ngā mahi a ngā tūpuna o Ngāi Tahu, nā rēira i tū whakaiti atu ai i nāianei i mua i ā rātou mokopuna.
    > 
    > *   "2 E whakaae ana te Karauna ki tōna tino hēanga, tērā i takakino tāruaruatia e ia ngā kaupapa o [te Tiriti o Waitangi][560] i roto i āna hokonga mai i ngā whenua o Ngāi Tahu. Tēnā, ka whakaae anō te Karauna tērā i roto i ngā āhuatanga i takoto ki roto i ngā pukapuka ā-herenga whakaatu i aua hokonga mai, kāore te Karauna i whai whakaaro ki tāna hoa nā rāua rā i haina te Tiriti, kāore hoki ia i whai whakaaro ki te wehe ake i ētahi whenua hei whai oranga tinana, whai oranga ngākau rānei mō Ngāi Tahu.
    > 
    > *   "3 E whakaae ana te Karauna tērā, i roto i tāna takakino i te wāhanga tuarua o te Tiriti, kāore ia i whai whakaaro ki te manaaki, ki te tiaki rānei i ngā mauanga whenua a Ngāi Tahu me ngā tino taonga i hiahia a Ngāi Tahu ki te pupuri.
    > 
    > *   "4 E mōhio ana te Karauna tērā, kāore ia i whai whakaaro ki a Ngāi Tahu i runga i te ngākau pono o roto i ngā tikanga i pūtake mai i te mana o te Karauna. Nā tāua whakaaro kore a te Karauna i puaki mai ai tēnei pēpeha a Ngāi Tahu: "'Te Hapa o Niu Tīreni'". E mōhio ana te Karauna i tāna hē ki te kaipono i ngā āhuatanga whai oranga mō Ngāi Tahu i noho pōhara noa ai te iwi ia whakatupuranga heke iho. Te whakatauākī i pūtake mai i aua āhuatanga: "'Te mate o te iwi'".
    > 
    > *   "5 E whakaae ana te Karauna tērā, mai rāno te piri pono o Ngāi Tahu ki te Karauna me te kawa pono a te iwi i ā rātou kawenga i raro i [te Tiriti o Waitangi][560], pērā anō tō rātou piri atu ki raro i te Hoko Whitu a Tū i ngā wā o ngā pakanga nunui o te ao. E tino mihi ana te Karauna ki a Ngāi Tahu mō tōna ngākau pono mō te koha hoki a te iwi o Ngāi Tahu ki te katoa o Aotearoa.
    > 
    > *   "6 E whakapuaki atu ana te Karauna ki te iwi whānui o Ngāi Tahu i te hōhonu o te āwhitu a te Karauna mō ngā mamaetanga, mō ngā whakawhiringa i pūtake mai nō roto i ngā takakino a te Karauna i takaongetia ai a Ngāi Tahu Whānui. E whakaae ana te Karauna tērā, aua mamaetanga me ngā whakawhiringa hoki i hua mai nō roto i ngā takakino a te Karauna, arā, kāore te Karauna i whai i ngā tohutohu a ngā pukapuka ā-herenga i tōna hokonga mai i ngā whenua o Ngāi Tahu, kāore hoki te Karauna i wehe ake kia rawaka he whenua mō te iwi, hei whakahaere mā rātou i ngā āhuatanga e whai oranga ai rātou, kāore hoki te Karauna i hanga i tētahi tikanga e maru motuhake ai te mana o Ngāi Tahu ki runga i ā rātou pounamu me ērā atu tāonga i hiahia te iwi ki te pupuri. Kore rawa te Karauna i aro ake ki ngā aurere a Ngāi Tahu.
    > 
    > *   "7 E whakapāha ana te Karauna ki a Ngāi Tahu mō tōna hēanga, tērā, kāore ia i whai whakaaro mō te rangatiratanga o Ngāi Tahu, ki te mana rānei o Ngāi Tahu ki runga i ōna whenua ā-rohe o Te Wai Pounamu, nā rēira, i runga i ngā whakaritenga me ngā herenga a [Te Tiriti o Waitangi][560], ka whakaae te Karauna ko Ngāi Tahu Whānui anō te tāngata whenua hei pupuri i te rangatiratanga o roto i ōna takiwā.

    > 
    
    

##### 6 Text in English
    
*   The text of the apology in English is as follows:
    
    > *   "1 The Crown recognises the protracted labours of the Ngāi Tahu ancestors in pursuit of their claims for redress and compensation against the Crown for nearly 150 years, as alluded to in the Ngāi Tahu proverb "'He mahi kai tākata, he mahi kai hoaka'" ("'It is work that consumes people, as greenstone consumes sandstone'"). The Ngāi Tahu understanding of the Crown's responsibilities conveyed to Queen Victoria by Matiaha Tiramōrehu in a petition in 1857, guided the Ngāi Tahu ancestors. Tiramōrehu wrote:
    >     
    >     'This was the command thy love laid upon these Governors... that the law be made one, that the commandments be made one, that the nation be made one, that the white skin be made just equal with the dark skin, and to lay down the love of thy graciousness to the Māori that they dwell happily... and remember the power of thy name.'
    >     
    >     The Crown hereby acknowledges the work of the Ngāi Tahu ancestors and makes this apology to them and to their descendants.
    > 
    > *   "2 The Crown acknowledges that it acted unconscionably and in repeated breach of the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi in its dealings with Ngāi Tahu in the purchases of Ngāi Tahu land. The Crown further acknowledges that in relation to the deeds of purchase it has failed in most material respects to honour its obligations to Ngāi Tahu as its Treaty partner, while it also failed to set aside adequate lands for Ngāi Tahu's use, and to provide adequate economic and social resources for Ngāi Tahu.
    > 
    > *   "3 The Crown acknowledges that, in breach of Article Two of the Treaty, it failed to preserve and protect Ngāi Tahu's use and ownership of such of their land and valued possessions as they wished to retain.
    > 
    > *   "4 The Crown recognises that it has failed to act towards Ngāi Tahu reasonably and with the utmost good faith in a manner consistent with the honour of the Crown. That failure is referred to in the Ngāi Tahu saying "'Te Hapa o Niu Tireni!'" ("'The unfulfilled promise of New Zealand'"). The Crown further recognises that its failure always to act in good faith deprived Ngāi Tahu of the opportunity to develop and kept the tribe for several generations in a state of poverty, a state referred to in the proverb "'Te mate o te iwi'" ("'The malaise of the tribe'").
    > 
    > *   "5 The Crown recognises that Ngāi Tahu has been consistently loyal to the Crown, and that the tribe has honoured its obligations and responsibilities under the Treaty of Waitangi and duties as citizens of the nation, especially, but not exclusively, in their active service in all of the major conflicts up to the present time to which New Zealand has sent troops. The Crown pays tribute to Ngāi Tahu's loyalty and to the contribution made by the tribe to the nation.
    > 
    > *   "6 The Crown expresses its profound regret and apologises unreservedly to all members of Ngāi Tahu Whānui for the suffering and hardship caused to Ngāi Tahu, and for the harmful effects which resulted to the welfare, economy and development of Ngāi Tahu as a tribe. The Crown acknowledges that such suffering, hardship and harmful effects resulted from its failures to honour its obligations to Ngāi Tahu under the deeds of purchase whereby it acquired Ngāi Tahu lands, to set aside adequate lands for the tribe's use, to allow reasonable access to traditional sources of food, to protect Ngāi Tahu's rights to pounamu and such other valued possessions as the tribe wished to retain, or to remedy effectually Ngāi Tahu's grievances.
    > 
    > *   "7 The Crown apologises to Ngāi Tahu for its past failures to acknowledge Ngāi Tahu rangatiratanga and mana over the South Island lands within its boundaries, and, in fulfilment of its Treaty obligations, the Crown recognises Ngāi Tahu as the tāngata whenua of, and as holding rangatiratanga within, the Takiwā of Ngāi Tahu Whānui.
    > 
    > *   "8 Accordingly, the Crown seeks on behalf of all New Zealanders to atone for these acknowledged injustices, so far as that is now possible, and, with the historical grievances finally settled as to matters set out in the Deed of Settlement signed on 21 November 1997, to begin the process of healing and to enter a new age of co-operation with Ngāi Tahu."

    (7) If the new Crown owner and Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu cannot agree on all the terms and conditions (including price) by the end of the 1-month period then---

    (8) If Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu gives such notice of acceptance to the new Crown owner, then the new Crown owner and Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu are deemed to have entered into an agreement for sale and purchase on those terms and conditions (including price), and the agreement is enforceable as a contract.
    
    (9) Subsection (10) applies if,---
        
    *   (a) at the end of the 5-working day period specified in subsection (7)(a), the new Crown owner and Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu have not agreed on all terms and conditions (including price) and Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu has not referred that matter to arbitration; or
    
    *   (b) at the end of the 5-working day period referred to in subsection 7(b), Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu has not notified its acceptance.
    
    (10) Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu is deemed to have given its written approval to the act, omission, or arrangement referred to in the definition of change of control in [section 87][98], but the requirements of this Part apply to any disposal or attempted disposal of the acquired land by the new Crown owner.
    
    (11) If the new Crown owner and Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu cannot agree on all terms and conditions (including price) for the offer given pursuant to subsections (2) or (3) and the matters that are not agreed are referred to arbitration pursuant to subsection 7(a), then the arbitration must be conducted in accordance with the [Arbitration Act 1996][783].
    
    (12) Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu may commence the arbitration referred to in subsection (11) by giving a notice to the new Crown owner.
    
    (13) The arbitration must be conducted---
        
    *   (a) by 1 arbitrator, if the new Crown owner and Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu can agree on an arbitrator; or
    
    *   (b) failing agreement, by 3 arbitrators, 1 to be appointed by the new Crown owner and 1 to be appointed by Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu and 1 to be appointed by the arbitrators appointed by the new Crown owner and Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu before they begin to consider the dispute.
    
    (14) The terms of appointment of an arbitrator must include requirements that---
        
    *   (a) the determination must be in the form of a written contract for sale and purchase of the acquired land incorporating all those terms and conditions (including price) that have already been agreed by the parties, if any, and also such other terms and conditions (including price) that would have been agreed by a willing seller with a willing buyer, each with equal bargaining strength and neither having the ability to impose terms on the other; and
    
    *   (b) the determination is made within 20 working days after the appointment of the arbitrator or arbitrators; and
    
    *   (c) the arbitrator or arbitrators must immediately notify the parties of the determination; and
    
    *   (d) the arbitrator or arbitrators must not disclose confidential information provided to the arbitrator or arbitrators in the course of the arbitration.

## Article the Third

In consideration thereof Her Majesty the Queen of England extends to the Natives of New Zealand Her royal protection and imparts to them all the Rights and Privileges of British Subjects.

## Schedule 14  
Statutory acknowledgement for Aoraki/Mount Cook

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the area known as Aoraki/Mount Cook located in Kā Tiritiri o te Moana (the Southern Alps), as shown on Allocation Plan MS 1 (SO 19831).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Aoraki as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Aoraki

In the beginning there was no Te Wai Pounamu or Aotearoa. The waters of Kiwa rolled over the place now occupied by the South Island, the North Island and Stewart Island. No sign of land existed.

Before Raki (the Sky Father) wedded Papatūānuku (the Earth Mother), each of them already had children by other unions. After the marriage, some of the Sky Children came down to greet their father's new wife and some even married Earth Daughters.

Among the celestial visitors were four sons of Raki who were named Aoraki (Cloud in the Sky), Rakiroa (Long Raki), Rakirua (Raki the Second), and Rārakiroa (Long Unbroken Line). They came down in a canoe which was known as Te Waka o Aoraki. They cruised around Papatūānuku who lay as one body in a huge continent known as Hawaiiki.

Then, keen to explore, the voyagers set out to sea, but no matter how far they travelled, they could not find land. They decided to return to their celestial home but the karakia (incantation) which should have lifted the waka (canoe) back to the heavens failed and their craft ran aground on a hidden reef, turning to stone and earth in the process.

The waka listed and settled with the west side much higher out of the water than the east. Thus the whole waka formed the South Island, hence the name: Te Waka o Aoraki. Aoraki and his brothers clambered on to the high side and were turned to stone. They are still there today. Aoraki is the mountain known to Pākehā as Mount Cook, and his brothers are the next highest peaks near him. The form of the island as it now is owes much to the subsequent deeds of Tū Te Rakiwhānoa, who took on the job of shaping the land to make it fit for human habitation.

For Ngāi Tahu, traditions such as this represent the links between the cosmological world of the gods and present generations, these histories reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

The meltwaters that flow from Aoraki are sacred. On special occasions of cultural moment, the blessings of Aoraki are sought through taking of small amounts of its ""special"" waters, back to other parts of the island for use in ceremonial occasions.

The mauri of Aoraki represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the mountain.

The saying ""He kapua kei runga i Aoraki, whakarewa whakarewa"" (""The cloud that floats aloft Aoraki, for ever fly, stay aloft"") refers to the cloud that often surrounds Aoraki. Aoraki does not always ""come out"" for visitors to see, just as that a great chief is not always giving audience, or on ""show"". It is for Aoraki to choose when to emerge from his cloak of mist, a power and influence that is beyond mortals, symbolising the mana of Aoraki.

To Ngāi Tahu, Aoraki represents the most sacred of ancestors, from whom Ngāi Tahu descend and who provides the iwi with its sense of communal identity, solidarity, and purpose. It follows that the ancestor embodied in the mountain remains the physical manifestation of Aoraki, the link between the supernatural and the natural world. The tapu associated with Aoraki is a significant dimension of the tribal value, and is the source of the power over life and death which the mountain possesses.

##### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

Pursuant to [section 215][241], and without limiting the rest of this schedule, the only purposes of this statutory acknowledgement are---
    
*   (a) to require that consent authorities forward summaries of resource consent applications to Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu as required by regulations made pursuant to [section 207][233] (clause 12.2.3 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (b) to require that consent authorities, Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga, or the Environment Court, as the case may be, have regard to this statutory acknowledgement in relation to Aoraki, as provided in [sections 208 to 210][234] (clause 12.2.4 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (c) to empower the Minister responsible for management of Aoraki or the Commissioner of Crown Lands, as the case may be, to enter into a Deed of Recognition as provided in [section 212][238] (clause 12.2.6 of the deed of settlement); and

##### Limitations on effect of statutory acknowledgement

Except as expressly provided in [sections 208 to 211][234], [213][239], and [215][241],---

*   (b) without limiting paragraph (a), no person or entity, in considering any matter or making any decision or recommendation under any statute, regulation, or bylaw, may give any greater or lesser weight to Ngāi Tahu's association to Aoraki (as described in this statutory acknowledgement) than that person or entity would give under the relevant statute, regulation, or bylaw, if this statutory acknowledgement did not exist in respect of Aoraki.

Except as expressly provided in this Act, this statutory acknowledgement does not affect the lawful rights or interests of any person who is not a party to the deed of settlement.

Except as expressly provided in this Act, this statutory acknowledgement does not, of itself, have the effect of granting, creating, or providing evidence of any estate or interest in, or any rights of any kind whatsoever relating to, Aoraki.
    
*   Schedule 14: amended, on 20 May 2014, by [section 107][717] of the Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga Act 2014 (2014 No 26).

## Schedule 15  
Statutory acknowledgement for Aparima River

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the river known as Aparima, the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 126 (SO 12265).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to the Aparima River, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with the Aparima River

The mouth of the Aparima was the site of a permanent settlement, with associated urupā nearby. Urupā are the resting places of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna and, as such, are the focus for whānau traditions. These are places holding the memories, traditions, victories and defeats of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna, and are frequently protected by secret locations.

The river was an important source of mahinga kai, with shellfish, mussels, paua, tuna (eels) and inaka (whitebait) all being taken from the river and its estuary. An eel weir was constructed at the narrows where the Pourakino River enters the Aparima, and was an important source of tuna.

The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka (landing places), places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the Aparima, the relationship of people with the river and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

The mouth of the Aparima was a tauranga waka, from which sea voyages were launched to and from a variety of locations in and around Te Ara a Kiwa (Foveaux Strait), Rakiura and the tītī islands. A carved tauihu (canoe prow) found in the estuary of the river attests to this.

The tūpuna had an intimate knowledge of navigation, river routes, safe harbours and landing places, and the locations of food and other resources on the Aparima. The river was an integral part of a network of trails which were used in order to ensure the safest journey and incorporated locations along the way that were identified for activities including camping overnight and gathering kai. Knowledge of these trails continues to be held by whānau and hapū and is regarded as a taonga. The traditional mobile lifestyle of the people led to their dependence on the resources of the river.

The mauri of the Aparima represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the river.

## Schedule 16  
Statutory acknowledgement for Hakataramea River

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the river known as Hakataramea the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 119 (SO 24724).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to the Hakataramea River, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with the Hakataramea River

The creation of the Hakataramea relates in time to Te Waka o Aoraki, and the further shaping of the island by Tū Te Rakiwhānoa and his assistants, including Marokura who stocked the waterways and Kahukura, who stocked the forests. For Ngāi Tahu, traditions such as this represent the links between the cosmological world of the gods and present generations, these histories reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

The name ""Hakataramea"" refers to the taramea plant from which a prized perfume was extracted. The name reflects the fact that taramea once grew in abundance in the vicinity of the river, and was easily accessed.

As well as being a mahinga kai in its own right, the Hakataramea was also an alternative route to the Aoraki region, forming part of the network of waterways and land-based mahinga kai in this part of the interior. This area was a part of the seasonal trail of mahinga kai and resource gathering, and hapū and whānau interaction. Knowledge of these trails continues to be held by whānau and hapū and is regarded as a taonga. The traditional mobile lifestyle of the people led to their dependence on the resources of the river.

The Hakataramea was a noted and popular indigenous fishery, offering tuna (eel), kanakana (lamprey), kōkopu, waikōura (freshwater crayfish) and waikākahi (freshwater mussel). Other mahinga kai taken from the Hakataramea included weka, tī kōuka (cabbage tree) and taramea (spaniard grass). The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the Hakataramea, the relationship of people with the river and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

These mahinga kai resources supported both semi-permanent and seasonal occupations, including a kāinga called Te Wai-tohi near the confluence of the Hakataramea and Waitaki rivers. The surviving rock art remnants and rock shelters are a particular taonga of the area, providing a unique record of the lives and beliefs of the people who travelled the river.

Because of the long history of use of the river as both a highway and a mahinga kai, supporting permanent and temporary occupation, there are a number of urupā, wāhi tapu and wāhi taonga associated with the river. These are all places holding the memories, traditions, victories and defeats of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna, and are frequently protected by secret locations. Urupā are the resting places of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna and, as such, are a particular focus for whānau traditions.

The mauri of the Hakataramea represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the river.

##### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

Pursuant to [section 215][241], and without limiting the rest of this schedule, the only purposes of this statutory acknowledgement are---
    
*   (a) to require that consent authorities forward summaries of resource consent applications to Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu as required by regulations made pursuant to [section 207][233] (clause 12.2.3 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (c) to empower the Minister responsible for management of the Hakataramea River or the Commissioner of Crown Lands, as the case may be, to enter into a Deed of Recognition as provided in [section 212][238] (clause 12.2.6 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (d) to enable Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu and any member of Ngāi Tahu Whānui to cite this statutory acknowledgement as evidence of the association of Ngāi Tahu to the Hakataramea River as provided in [section 211][237] (clause 12.2.5 of the deed of settlement).

##### Limitations on effect of statutory acknowledgement

Except as expressly provided in [sections 208 to 211][234], [213][239], and [215][241],---

Except as expressly provided in this Act, this statutory acknowledgement does not affect the lawful rights or interests of any person who is not a party to the deed of settlement.

Except as expressly provided in this Act, this statutory acknowledgement does not, of itself, have the effect of granting, creating, or providing evidence of any estate or interest in, or any rights of any kind whatsoever relating to, the Hakataramea River.

## Schedule 17  
Statutory acknowledgement for Hakatere (Ashburton River)

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the river known as Hakatere (Ashburton River), the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 116 (SO 19852).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to the Hakatere, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with the Hakatere

The Hakatere was a major mahinga kai for Canterbury Ngāi Tahu. The main foods taken from the river were tuna (eels), inaka (whitebait) and the giant kōkopu. Rats, weka, kiwi and waterfowl such as pūtakitaki (paradise duck) were also hunted along the river.

The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the river, the relationship of people with the river and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

The mauri of the Hakatere represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the river.

##### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

## Schedule 18  
Statutory acknowledgement for Hananui (Mount Anglem)

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the area known as Hananui (Mt Anglem), as shown on Allocation Plan MS 264 (SO 12249).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Hananui, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Hananui

As with all principal maunga (mountains), Hananui is imbued with the spiritual elements of Raki and Papa, in tradition and practice regarded as an important link to the primeval parents.

The name Hananui is derived from an event involving the tupuna (ancestor) Rakitamau, a chief of Te Taumutu, and son of Tū Te Kawa. Rakitamau became a widower through the unfortunate death of his wife. Rakitamau journeyed to Motunui (as Rakiura was called then) seeking the hand of a tribally renowned wahine (woman) to take her place, as in his view she would increase his standing due to her mana, reflected in her connections to the land and important people of Rakiura.

On his arrival at her village, Rakitamau asked for the woman by name, only to be told by a laughing group of women she was tāpui (betrothed or set apart). At this, Rakitamau blushed deeply. When he then asked for her sister the people laughed loudly, as they told him she was tāpui also. This news made him blush further so that his cheeks flamed. He left the island never to return and the women were so amused that they named the highest point on the island Hananui, referring to the great glow of Rakitamau, in memory of the event. Rakiura itself takes its name from the glowing skies of this region, the aurora lights.

For Ngāi Tahu, traditions such as this represent the links between the cosmological world of the gods and present generations, these histories reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

Pūtātāra was an old settlement under the lee of Hananui, a place to which an Otago rangatira (chief), Tukiauau, retired to seek refuge.

The mauri of Hananui represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with Hananui.

##### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

Pursuant to [section 215][241], and without limiting the rest of this schedule, the only purposes of this statutory acknowledgement are---
    
*   (a) to require that consent authorities forward summaries of resource consent applications to Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu as required by regulations made pursuant to [section 207][233] (clause 12.2.3 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (b) to require that consent authorities, Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga, or the Environment Court, as the case may be, have regard to this statutory acknowledgement in relation to Hananui, as provided in [sections 208 to 210][234] (clause 12.2.4 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (c) to empower the Minister responsible for management of Hananui or the Commissioner of Crown Lands, as the case may be, to enter into a Deed of Recognition as provided in [section 212][238] (clause 12.2.6 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (d) to enable Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu and any member of Ngāi Tahu Whānui to cite this statutory acknowledgement as evidence of the association of Ngāi Tahu to Hananui as provided in [section 211][237] (clause 12.2.5 of the deed of settlement).

##### Limitations on effect of statutory acknowledgement

Except as expressly provided in [sections 208 to 211][234], [213][239], and [215][241],---

## Schedule 19  
Statutory acknowledgement for Hekeao (Hinds River)

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the river known as Hekeao (Hinds River), the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 117 (SO 19853).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to the Hekeao, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with the Hekeao

Hekeao and Tokara (the two branches of the Hinds River) traditionally supported a number of nohoanga (settlements), including Hekeao, Kakaho, Koroki, Te Mihi, Pakutahi, Karipo, Pūrākaunui, Rukuhia and Tokara. As a result of this history of occupations, there are a number of urupā associated with the river. Urupā are the resting places of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna and, as such, are the focus for whānau traditions. These are places holding the memories, traditions, victories and defeats of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna, and are frequently protected by secret locations.

The river was an important mahinga kai, known particularly as a source of tuna (eel) and kanakana (lamprey). The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the river, the relationship of people with the river and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

The mauri of Hekeao and Tokara represent the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the river.

## Schedule 20  
Statutory acknowledgement for Hoka Kura (Lake Sumner)

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the lake known as Hoka Kura (Lake Sumner), the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 127 (SO 19854).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Hoka Kura, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Hoka Kura

Hoka Kura is one of the lakes referred to in the tradition of ""Ngā Puna Wai Karikari o Rakaihautu"" which tells how the principal lakes of Te Wai Pounamu were dug by the rangatira (chief) Rakaihautu. Rakaihautu was the captain of the canoe, Uruao, which brought the tribe, Waitaha, to New Zealand. Rakaihautu beached his canoe at Whakatū (Nelson). From Whakatū, Rakaihautu divided the new arrivals in two, with his son taking one party to explore the coastline southwards and Rakaihautu taking another southwards by an inland route. On his inland journey southward, Rakaihautu used his famous kō (a tool similar to a spade) to dig the principal lakes of Te Wai Pounamu, including Hoka Kura. The origins of the name ""Hoka Kura"" have now been lost, although it is likely that it refers to one of the descendants of Rakaihautu.

For Ngāi Tahu, traditions such as this represent the links between the cosmological world of the gods and present generations, these histories reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

Hoka Kura was used as a mahinga kai by North Canterbury Ngāi Tahu. The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the lake, the relationship of people with the lake and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

The mahinga kai values of the lake were particularly important to Ngāi Tahu parties travelling to Te Tai Poutini (the West Coast). The lake was an integral part of a network of trails which were used in order to ensure the safest journey and incorporated locations along the way that were identified for activities including camping overnight and gathering kai. Knowledge of these trails continues to be held by whānau and hapū and is regarded as a taonga. The traditional mobile lifestyle of the people led to their dependence on the resources of the lake.

There are a number of urupā and wāhi tapu in this region. Urupā are the resting places of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna and, as such, are the focus for whānau traditions. Urupā and wāhi tapu are places holding the memories, traditions, victories and defeats of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna, and are frequently protected by secret locations.

The mauri of Hoka Kura represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the lake.

##### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

Pursuant to [section 215][241], and without limiting the rest of this schedule, the only purposes of this statutory acknowledgement are---
    
*   (a) to require that consent authorities forward summaries of resource consent applications to Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu as required by regulations made pursuant to [section 207][233] (clause 12.2.3 of the deed of settlement); and

## Schedule 21  
Statutory acknowledgement for Hurunui River

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the river known as Hurunui, the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 112 (SO 19848).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to the Hurunui River, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with the Hurunui River

The Hurunui River once provided an important mahinga kai resource for Ngāi Tahu, although those resources are now in a modified and depleted condition. Traditionally, the river was particularly known for its tuna (eel) and inaka (whitebait).

The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the Hurunui, the relationship of people with the river and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

Nohoanga (settlements) were located at points along the length of this river, with some wāhi tapu located near the mouth. Wāhi tapu are places holding the memories, traditions, victories and defeats of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna, and are frequently protected by secret locations.

The mauri of the Hurunui represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the river.

##### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

Pursuant to [section 215][241], and without limiting the rest of this schedule, the only purposes of this statutory acknowledgement are---
    
*   (a) to require that consent authorities forward summaries of resource consent applications to Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu as required by regulations made pursuant to [section 207][233] (clause 12.2.3 of the deed of settlement); and

## Schedule 22  
Statutory acknowledgement for Kā Moana Haehae (Lake Roxburgh)

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the lake known as Kā Moana Haehae (Lake Roxburgh), the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 491 (SO 24730).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Kā Moana Haehae, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Kā Moana Haehae

The name Kā Moana Haehae refers to the joining of two waterways. In this case it refers to the confluence of the Mata-au and Manuherikia Rivers over which the lake lies.

The whole of the Mata-au (Clutha River), on which Kā Moana Haehae lies, was part of a mahinga kai trail that led inland and was used by Otago hapū including Ngāti Kurī, Ngāti Ruahikihiki, Ngāti Huirapa and Ngāi Tuahuriri. The river was used as a highway into the interior, and provided many resources to sustain travellers on that journey. The river was a significant indigenous fishery, providing tuna (eels), kanakana (lamprey) and kōkopu in the area over which Kā Moana Haehae now lies. Manu (birds), including moa, were taken from areas adjoining the river, over which the lake now lies.

The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the river, the relationship of people with the river and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

The waterway was also very important in the transportation of pounamu from inland areas down to settlements on the coast, from where it was traded north and south. Thus there were numerous tauranga waka (landing places) along it. The tūpuna had an intimate knowledge of navigation, river routes, safe harbours and landing places, and the locations of food and other resources on the river. The waterway was an integral part of a network of trails which were used in order to ensure the safest journey and incorporated locations along the way that were identified for activities including camping overnight and gathering kai. Knowledge of these trails continues to be held by whānau and hapū and is regarded as a taonga. The traditional mobile lifestyle of the people led to their dependence on the resources of the waterway.

The mauri of Kā Moana Haehae represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the lake.

##### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

Pursuant to [section 215][241], and without limiting the rest of this schedule, the only purposes of this statutory acknowledgement are---
    
*   (a) to require that consent authorities forward summaries of resource consent applications to Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu as required by regulations made pursuant to [section 207][233] (clause 12.2.3 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (b) to require that consent authorities, Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga, or the Environment Court, as the case may be, have regard to this statutory acknowledgement in relation to Kā Moana Haehae, as provided in [sections 208 to 210][234] (clause 12.2.4 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (c) to empower the Minister responsible for management of Kā Moana Haehae or the Commissioner of Crown Lands, as the case may be, to enter into a Deed of Recognition as provided in [section 212][238] (clause 12.2.6 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (d) to enable Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu and any member of Ngāi Tahu Whānui to cite this statutory acknowledgement as evidence of the association of Ngāi Tahu to Kā Moana Haehae as provided in [section 211][237] (clause 12.2.5 of the deed of settlement).

##### Limitations on effect of statutory acknowledgement

Except as expressly provided in [sections 208 to 211][234], [213][239], and [215][241],---
    
*   (a) this statutory acknowledgement does not affect, and is not to be taken into account in, the exercise of any power, duty, or function by any person or entity under any statute, regulation, or bylaw; and

*   (b) without limiting paragraph (a), no person or entity, in considering any matter or making any decision or recommendation under any statute, regulation, or bylaw, may give any greater or lesser weight to Ngāi Tahu's association to Kā Moana Haehae (as described in this statutory acknowledgement) than that person or entity would give under the relevant statute, regulation, or bylaw, if this statutory acknowledgement did not exist in respect of Kā Moana Haehae.

Except as expressly provided in this Act, this statutory acknowledgement does not affect the lawful rights or interests of any person who is not a party to the deed of settlement.

Except as expressly provided in this Act, this statutory acknowledgement does not, of itself, have the effect of granting, creating, or providing evidence of any estate or interest in, or any rights of any kind whatsoever relating to, Kā Moana Haehae.

## Schedule 23  
Statutory acknowledgement for Kakaunui River

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the river known as Kakaunui, the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 120 (SO 24725).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to the Kakaunui River, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with the Kakaunui River

The creation of the Kakaunui relates in time to Te Waka o Aoraki, and the further shaping of the island by Tū Te Rakiwhānoa and his assistants, including Marokura who stocked the waterways and Kahukura, who stocked the forests. For Ngāi Tahu, traditions such as this represent the links between the cosmological world of the gods and present generations, these histories reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi. The origin of the name ""Kakaunui"" has been lost, but is likely to refer to swimming in the river.

There was a tauranga waka (landing place) at the mouth of the Kakaunui, which was an important part of the coastal trails north and south. The river was also a part of the seasonal trail of mahinga kai and resource gathering, and hapū and whānau bonding. The tūpuna had an intimate knowledge of navigation, river routes, safe harbours and landing places, and the locations of food and other resources on the river. The Kakaunui was an integral part of a network of trails which were used in order to ensure the safest journey and incorporated locations along the way that were identified for activities including camping overnight and gathering kai. Knowledge of these trails continues to be held by whānau and hapū and is regarded as a taonga. The traditional mobile lifestyle of the people led to their dependence on the resources of the river.

The Kakaunui was a noted indigenous fishery, offering tuna (eel), inaka (whitebait), kanakana (lamprey), kōkopu and other species. Other materials provided by the river included raupō, harakeke and watercress. The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the Kakaunui, the relationship of people with the river and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

These mahinga kai resources supported both semi-permanent and seasonal occupations, including a kāinga on the northern bank of the river near Maheno. The surviving rock art remnants and rock shelters are a particular taonga of the area, providing a unique record of the lives and beliefs of the people who travelled the river.

The mauri of the Kakaunui represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the river.

##### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

Pursuant to [section 215][241], and without limiting the rest of this schedule, the only purposes of this statutory acknowledgement are---
    
*   (a) to require that consent authorities forward summaries of resource consent applications to Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu as required by regulations made pursuant to [section 207][233] (clause 12.2.3 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (b) to require that consent authorities, Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga, or the Environment Court, as the case may be, have regard to this statutory acknowledgement in relation to the Kakaunui River, as provided in [sections 208 to 210][234] (clause 12.2.4 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (c) to empower the Minister responsible for management of the Kakaunui River or the Commissioner of Crown Lands, as the case may be, to enter into a Deed of Recognition as provided in [section 212][238] (clause 12.2.6 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (d) to enable Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu and any member of Ngāi Tahu Whānui to cite this statutory acknowledgement as evidence of the association of Ngāi Tahu to the Kakaunui River as provided in [section 211][237] (clause 12.2.5 of the deed of settlement).

##### Limitations on effect of statutory acknowledgement

Except as expressly provided in [sections 208 to 211][234], [213][239], and [215][241],---
    
*   (a) this statutory acknowledgement does not affect, and is not to be taken into account in, the exercise of any power, duty, or function by any person or entity under any statute, regulation, or bylaw; and

*   (b) without limiting paragraph (a), no person or entity, in considering any matter or making any decision or recommendation under any statute, regulation, or bylaw, may give any greater or lesser weight to Ngāi Tahu's association to the Kakaunui River (as described in this statutory acknowledgement) than that person or entity would give under the relevant statute, regulation, or bylaw, if this statutory acknowledgement did not exist in respect of the Kakaunui River.

Except as expressly provided in this Act, this statutory acknowledgement does not affect the lawful rights or interests of any person who is not a party to the deed of settlement.

Except as expressly provided in this Act, this statutory acknowledgement does not, of itself, have the effect of granting, creating, or providing evidence of any estate or interest in, or any rights of any kind whatsoever relating to, the Kakaunui River.

## Schedule 24  
Statutory acknowledgement for Karangarua Lagoon

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the wetland known as Karangarua Lagoon, the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 50 (SO 12512).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Karangarua Lagoon, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Karangarua Lagoon

Manawhenua (tribal authority over the area) was gained through Ngāi Tahu's defeat of Ngāti Wairaki, Tūmatakōkiri and Ngāti Toa. For Ngāi Tahu, histories such as this reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

Seasonal kāinga nohoanga (settlements) were established at the mouth of the Karangarua Lagoon for the taking of kai-awa (river-sourced foods) and manu (birds).

Karangarua Lagoon was and still is a significant spawning ground and kōhanga (nursery) for a variety of fish species and a significant breeding area for manu. The lagoon remains a source of rich and abundant harvests. Pokorotutu and Ōtehautumua were and are notable mahinga kai areas at the north and south ends respectively of the Karangarua. The area is noted particularly for its tuna (eel) and inaka (whitebait) fisheries, as a source of rāranga (weaving) materials and other useful plants including raupō, wīwī and harakeke. The traditional practice of collecting seagull eggs from the lagoon during spring is still carried out by local Ngāi Tahu.

The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the lagoon, the relationship of people with the lagoon and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

As a mark of the significance of the lagoon as a mahinga kai, reserves were set aside for Ngāi Tahu in this area at the time of the 1860 Arahura Deed of Sale, and subsequently under the South Island Landless Natives Act 1906\.

The mauri of Karangarua Lagoon represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the lagoon.

##### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

Pursuant to [section 215][241], and without limiting the rest of this schedule, the only purposes of this statutory acknowledgement are---

*   (b) to require that consent authorities, Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga, or the Environment Court, as the case may be, have regard to this statutory acknowledgement in relation to Karangarua Lagoon, as provided in [sections 208 to 210][234] (clause 12.2.4 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (c) to empower the Minister responsible for management of Karangarua Lagoon or the Commissioner of Crown Lands, as the case may be, to enter into a Deed of Recognition as provided in [section 212][238] (clause 12.2.6 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (d) to enable Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu and any member of Ngāi Tahu Whānui to cite this statutory acknowledgement as evidence of the association of Ngāi Tahu to Karangarua Lagoon as provided in [section 211][237] (clause 12.2.5 of the deed of settlement).

##### Limitations on effect of statutory acknowledgement

Except as expressly provided in [sections 208 to 211][234], [213][239], and [215][241],---
    
*   (a) this statutory acknowledgement does not affect, and is not to be taken into account in, the exercise of any power, duty, or function by any person or entity under any statute, regulation, or bylaw; and

*   (b) without limiting paragraph (a), no person or entity, in considering any matter or making any decision or recommendation under any statute, regulation, or bylaw, may give any greater or lesser weight to Ngāi Tahu's association to Karangarua Lagoon (as described in this statutory acknowledgement) than that person or entity would give under the relevant statute, regulation, or bylaw, if this statutory acknowledgement did not exist in respect of Karangarua Lagoon.

## Schedule 25  
Statutory acknowledgement for Kōtuku-Whakaoho (Lake Brunner Moana)

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the lake known as Kōtuku-Whakaoho (Lake Brunner Moana), the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 131 (SO 12515).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Kōtuku-Whakaoho, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Kōtuku-Whakaoho

The name Kōtuku-Whakaoho relates to a husband and wife called Kōtuku and Māwhera. Both were killed at this site which led to one (Kōtuku) having their name applied to the lake and the other (Māwhera) lending their name to the Grey River.

As with most lakes, there is also a tradition of a taniwha connected with Kōtuku-Whakaoho. The story tells how two taniwha were killed by a chief because they had killed his father and sister. On their deaths, the taniwha became islands which now lie in the lake.

For Ngāi Tahu, traditions such as this represent the links between the cosmological world of the gods and present generations, these histories reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

Kōtuku-Whakaoho holds an important place in Ngāi Tahu history as the site of the tribe's battle with Ngāti Wairaki. Victory in this battle saw Ngāi Tahu gain manawhenua in the area.

Besides being a famous battle ground, Kōtuku-Whakaoho was important as the site of a permanent settlement, acting as a focal point for food-gathering parties. The principal food taken from the lake was tuna (eel). Water fowl and forest fowl were also important mahinga kai in this area.

The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the lake, the relationship of people with the lake and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

The importance of the area to Ngāi Tahu was recognised by the Crown in the setting aside of a reserve at the lake for Ihaia, Tainui and Waipapara

The mauri of Kōtuku-Whakaoho represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the lake.

##### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

Pursuant to [section 215][241], and without limiting the rest of this schedule, the only purposes of this statutory acknowledgement are---
    
*   (a) to require that consent authorities forward summaries of resource consent applications to Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu as required by regulations made pursuant to [section 207][233] (clause 12.2.3 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (b) to require that consent authorities, Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga, or the Environment Court, as the case may be, have regard to this statutory acknowledgement in relation to Kōtuku-Whakaoho, as provided in [section 208 to 210][234] (clause 12.2.4 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (c) to empower the Minister responsible for management of Kōtuku-Whakaoho or the Commissioner of Crown Lands, as the case may be, to enter into a Deed of Recognition as provided in [section 212][238] (clause 12.2.6 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (d) to enable Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu and any member of Ngāi Tahu Whānui to cite this statutory acknowledgement as evidence of the association of Ngāi Tahu to Kōtuku-Whakaoho as provided in [section 211][237] (clause 12.2.5 of the deed of settlement).

## Schedule 26  
Statutory acknowledgement for Kōwai River

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the river known as Kōwai, the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 114 (SO 19850).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to the Kōwai River, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with the Kōwai River

The Kōwai River once provided an important mahinga kai resource for North Canterbury Ngāi Tahu. Traditionally, the river was known for its tuna (eel) and inaka (whitebait), although those resources have now been depleted.

The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the river, the relationship of people with the river and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

Nohoanga (settlements) were located at points along the length of this river, with some wāhi tapu located near the mouth. Wāhi tapu are places holding the memories, traditions, victories and defeats of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna, and are frequently protected by secret locations.

The mauri of the Kōwai River represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the river.

##### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

## Schedule 27  
Statutory acknowledgement for Kura Tāwhiti (Castle Hill)

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the area known as Kura Tāwhiti (Castle Hill Conservation Area), as shown on Allocation Plan MS 14 (SO 19832).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Kura Tāwhiti, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Kura Tāwhiti

Kura Tāwhiti (Castle Hill) is located between the Torlesse and Craigieburn Ranges, in the Broken River catchment. The name Kura Tāwhiti literally means ""the treasure from a distant land"", and is an allusion to the kūmara, an important food once cultivated in this region. However, Kura Tāwhiti was also the name of one of the tūpuna (ancestors) who was aboard the Arai Te Uru canoe when it sank off Matakaea (Shag Point) in North Otago.

Kura Tāwhiti was one of the mountains claimed by the Ngāi Tahu ancestor Tane Tiki. Tane Tiki claimed this mountain range for his daughter Hine Mihi because he wanted the feathers from the kākāpo taken in this area to make a cloak for her.

For Ngāi Tahu, traditions such as this represent the links between the cosmological world of the gods and present generations, these histories reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

This region was a well used mahinga kai for Kaiapoi Ngāi Tahu. The main food taken from this mountain range was the kiore (polynesian rat). Other foods taken included tuna (eel), kākāpo, weka and kiwi.

The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of Kura Tāwhiti, the relationship of people with the land and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

Kura Tāwhiti was an integral part of a network of trails which were used in order to ensure the safest journey and incorporated locations along the way that were identified for activities including camping overnight and gathering kai. Knowledge of these trails continues to be held by whānau and hapū and is regarded as a taonga. The traditional mobile lifestyle of the people led to their dependence on the resources of the area.

A particular taonga of Kura Tāwhiti are the ancient rock art remnants found on the rock outcrops. These outcrops provided vital shelters from the elements for the people in their travels, and they left their artworks behind as a record of their lives and beliefs. The combination of this long association with the rock outcrops, and the significance of the art on them, give rise to their tapu status for Ngāi Tahu.

The mauri of Kura Tāwhiti represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the area.

## Schedule 28  
Statutory acknowledgement for Kuramea (Lake Catlins)

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the lake known as Kuramea (Lake Catlins), the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 134 (SO 24728).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Kuramea, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Kuramea

Kuramea is the traditional name for the waterway now known as Catlins Lake.

The lake and estuary were significant sources of mahinga kai, supporting a number of nohoanga (settlements) in the vicinity. Tuna (eels), inaka (whitebait), tuaki (cockles), pupu (mudsnails), pipi and flatfish were taken from Kuramea. The lake was also a source of rāranga (weaving) materials including harakeke and paru (mud used in dyeing).

The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of Kuramea, the relationship of people with the lake and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

As a result of this history of use, there are a number of wāhi taonga within the wetland area, including middens and other evidence of occupation. These are important as places holding the memories of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna. In particular, a number of archaelogical finds within the wetlands confirm the area's history as a waka (canoe) building area.

The mauri of Kuramea represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the lake.

##### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

Pursuant to [section 215][241], and without limiting the rest of this schedule, the only purposes of this statutory acknowledgement are---
    
*   (a) to require that consent authorities forward summaries of resource consent applications to Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu as required by regulations made pursuant to [section 207][233] (clause 12.2.3 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (b) to require that consent authorities, Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga, or the Environment Court, as the case may be, have regard to this statutory acknowledgement in relation to Kuramea, as provided in [sections 208 to 210][234] (clause 12.2.4 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (c) to empower the Minister responsible for management of Kuramea or the Commissioner of Crown Lands, as the case may be, to enter into a Deed of Recognition as provided in [section 212][238] (clause 12.2.6 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (d) to enable Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu and any member of Ngāi Tahu Whānui to cite this statutory acknowledgement as evidence of the association of Ngāi Tahu to Kuramea as provided in [section 211][237] (clause 12.2.5 of the deed of settlement).

##### Limitations on effect of statutory acknowledgement

Except as expressly provided in [sections 208 to 211][234], [213][239], and [215][241],---
    
*   (a) this statutory acknowledgement does not affect, and is not to be taken into account in, the exercise of any power, duty, or function by any person or entity under any statute, regulation, or bylaw; and

*   (b) without limiting paragraph (a), no person or entity, in considering any matter or making any decision or recommendation under any statute, regulation, or bylaw, may give any greater or lesser weight to Ngāi Tahu's association to Kuramea (as described in this statutory acknowledgement) than that person or entity would give under the relevant statute, regulation, or bylaw, if this statutory acknowledgement did not exist in respect of Kuramea.

Except as expressly provided in this Act, this statutory acknowledgement does not affect the lawful rights or interests of any person who is not a party to the deed of settlement.

Except as expressly provided in this Act, this statutory acknowledgement does not, of itself, have the effect of granting, creating, or providing evidence of any estate or interest in, or any rights of any kind whatsoever relating to, Kuramea.
    
*   Schedule 28: amended, on 20 May 2014, by [section 107][717] of the Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga Act 2014 (2014 No 26).

## Schedule 29  
Statutory acknowledgement for Lake Hauroko

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the lake known as Hauroko, the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 41 (SO 12258).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Lake Hauroko, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Lake Hauroko

Hauroko is strongly associated with urupā in the immediate vicinity, including one on an island in the lake, known to Pākehā as Mary Island. In particular, Ngāti Rakiamoa and Ngāti Ruahikihiki have several traditions about their dead lying in this region.

Urupā are the resting places of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna and, as such, are the focus for whānau traditions. These are places holding the memories, traditions, victories and defeats of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna, and are frequently protected by secret locations. It is because of its proximity to these urupā that Hauroko is considered tapu by Ngāi Tahu.

The mauri of Hauroko represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the lake.

##### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

Pursuant to [section 215][241], and without limiting the rest of this schedule, the only purposes of this statutory acknowledgement are---
    
*   (a) to require that consent authorities forward summaries of resource consent applications to Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu as required by regulations made pursuant to [section 207][233] (clause 12.2.3 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (b) to require that consent authorities, Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga, or the Environment Court, as the case may be, have regard to this statutory acknowledgement in relation to Lake Hauroko, as provided in [sections 208 to 210][234] (clause 12.2.4 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (c) to empower the Minister responsible for management of Lake Hauroko or the Commissioner of Crown Lands, as the case may be, to enter into a Deed of Recognition as provided in [section 212][238] (clause 12.2.6 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (d) to enable Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu and any member of Ngāi Tahu Whānui to cite this statutory acknowledgement as evidence of the association of Ngāi Tahu to Lake Hauroko as provided in [section 211][237] (clause 12.2.5 of the deed of settlement).

##### Limitations on effect of statutory acknowledgement

Except as expressly provided in [sections 208 to 211][234], [213][239], and [215][241],---
    
*   (a) this statutory acknowledgement does not affect, and is not to be taken into account in, the exercise of any power, duty, or function by any person or entity under any statute, regulation, or bylaw; and

*   (b) without limiting paragraph (a), no person or entity, in considering any matter or making any decision or recommendation under any statute, regulation, or bylaw, may give any greater or lesser weight to Ngāi Tahu's association to Lake Hauroko (as described in this statutory acknowledgement) than that person or entity would give under the relevant statute, regulation, or bylaw, if this statutory acknowledgement did not exist in respect of Lake Hauroko.

Except as expressly provided in this Act, this statutory acknowledgement does not affect the lawful rights or interests of any person who is not a party to the deed of settlement.

Except as expressly provided in this Act, this statutory acknowledgement does not, of itself, have the effect of granting, creating, or providing evidence of any estate or interest in, or any rights of any kind whatsoever relating to, Lake Hauroko.

## Schedule 30  
Statutory acknowledgement for Lake Hawea

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the lake known as Hawea, the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 37 (SO 24718).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Lake Hawea, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Lake Hawea

Hawea is one of the lakes referred to in the tradition of ""Ngā Puna Wai Karikari o Rakaihautu"" which tells how the principal lakes of Te Wai Pounamu were dug by the rangatira (chief) Rakaihautu. Rakaihautu was the captain of the canoe, Uruao, which brought the tribe, Waitaha, to New Zealand. Rakaihautu beached his canoe at Whakatū (Nelson). From Whakatū, Rakaihautu divided the new arrivals in two, with his son taking one party to explore the coastline southwards and Rakaihautu taking another southwards by an inland route. On his inland journey southward, Rakaihautu used his famous kō (a tool similar to a spade) to dig the principal lakes of Te Wai Pounamu, including Hawea.

For Ngāi Tahu, traditions such as this represent the links between the cosmological world of the gods and present generations, these histories reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

The name Hawea may derive from Hawea, tupuna (ancestor) of the Waitaha hapū, Ngāti Hawea.

Hawea was traditionally noted as a rich tuna (eel) fishery, with many thousands of the fish once being caught, preserved and transported back to the kāinga nohoanga (settlements) of coastal Otago.

The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of Hawea, the relationship of people with the lake and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

The mauri of Hawea represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the lake.

## Schedule 31  
Statutory acknowledgement for Lake Kaniere

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the lake known as Kaniere, the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 133 (SO 12517).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Lake Kaniere, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Lake Kaniere

Kaniere is noted in Ngāi Tahu tradition as a lake occupied by the Ngāti Wairaki explorer, Raureka. According to tradition, Raureka was the first to cross Kā Tiritiri o te Moana (the Southern Alps) from her village at Arahura. Apparently she left the village after an argument with her Ngāti Wairaki whānaunga (relatives). Raureka was accompanied by her slave as she wandered up to Kaniere and eventually came across a pass which took her to the Rakaia Valley and eventually the Canterbury Plains.

This route came to be later known as Noti Raureka (Brownings Pass). On the east coast, Raureka fell in with a number of Ngāi Tahu in the Temuka region who were felling timber with adzes. Raureka showed them her pounamu (greenstone) adze and proceeded to fell the tī tree. The Ngāi Tahu agreed that her pounamu was a better stone for an adze. Raureka eventually led a Ngāi Tahu party across the Alps to show them the source of pounamu.

For Ngāi Tahu, histories such as this reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

Kaniere was also an important mahinga kai used by parties crossing between the coasts. Tuna (eels) and weka were the main foods taken in this area. The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the lake, the relationship of people with the lake and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

Because of its importance as a mahinga kai, the Crown set aside a reserve at the lake for Ngāi Tahu last century.

The mauri of Kaniere represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the lake.

##### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

## Schedule 32  
Statutory acknowledgement for Lake Ōhau

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the lake known as Ōhau, the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 36 (SO 19838).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Lake Ōhau, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Lake Ōhau

Ōhau is one of the lakes referred to in the tradition of ""Ngā Puna Wai Karikari o Rakaihautu"" which tells how the principal lakes of Te Wai Pounamu were dug by the rangatira (chief) Rakaihautu. Rakaihautu was the captain of the canoe, Uruao, which brought the tribe, Waitaha, to New Zealand. Rakaihautu beached his canoe at Whakatū (Nelson). From Whakatū, Rakaihautu divided the new arrivals in two, with his son taking one party to explore the coastline southwards and Rakaihautu taking another southwards by an inland route. On his inland journey southward, Rakaihautu used his famous kō (a tool similar to a spade) to dig the principal lakes of Te Wai Pounamu, including Ōhau. It is probable that the name ""Ōhau"" comes from one of the descendants of Rakaihautu, Hau.

For Ngāi Tahu, traditions such as this represent the links between the cosmological world of the gods and present generations, these histories reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

Ōhau was traditionally occupied by the descendants of Te Rakitauhope and was the site of several battles between Ngāi Tahu and Ngāti Mamoe. Later, it supported Te Maiharoa and his followers in the 1870s when they took occupation of land in the interior in protest against the Crown's failure to honour the 1848 Canterbury Purchase.

As a result of this history of occupation, there are a number of urupā and wāhi tapu associated with the lake. Urupā are the resting places of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna and, as such, are the focus for whānau traditions. Urupā and wāhi tapu are places holding the memories, traditions, victories and defeats of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna, and are frequently protected by secret locations.

Ōhau was an important mahinga kai, and part of a wider mahinga kai trail that ran from Lake Pūkaki to the coast. The main foods taken in this area were weka, forest and water fowl and freshwater fish such as tuna (eel) and kōkopu.

The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the lake, the relationship of people with the lake and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

The mauri of Ōhau represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the lake.

##### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

Pursuant to [section 215][241], and without limiting the rest of this schedule, the only purposes of this statutory acknowledgement are---
    
*   (a) to require that consent authorities forward summaries of resource consent applications to Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu as required by regulations made pursuant to [section 207][233] (clause 12.2.3 of the deed of settlement); and

## Schedule 33  
Statutory acknowledgement for Lake Pāringa

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the lake known as Pāringa, the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 132 (SO 12516).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Lake Pāringa, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Lake Pāringa

Manawhenua (tribal authority over the area) was gained by Ngāi Tahu's defeat of Ngāti Wairaki, Tūmatakōkiri and Ngāti Toa. For Ngāi Tahu, histories such as this reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

Seasonal kāinga nohoanga (settlements) were established for the taking of mahinga kai. Pāringa was and still is a noted tuna (eel) fishery, significant spawning ground and kōhanga (nursery) for a variety of fish species and significant breeding area for manu (birds), including ducks, kūkupa (kererū/wood pigeon) and weka (now extinct in this area). The lake was therefore a source of rich and abundant harvests. The area also provided plants utilised in rāranga (weaving) and other practices.

The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka (landing places), places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the lake, the relationship of people with the lake and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today. Because of the kāinga nohoanga, a reserve was set aside for Ngāi Tahu in this area at the time of the 1860 Arahura Deed of Sale.

The lake also is a wāhi tapu. Wāhi tapu are places holding the memories, traditions, victories and defeats of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna, and are frequently protected by secret locations.

The mauri of Lake Pāringa represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the lake.

##### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

## Schedule 34  
Statutory acknowledgement for Lake Pūkaki

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the lake known as Pūkaki, the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 35 (SO 19837).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Lake Pūkaki, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Lake Pūkaki

Pūkaki is one of the lakes referred to in the tradition of ""Ngā Puna Wai Karikari o Rakaihautu"" which tells how the principal lakes of Te Wai Pounamu were dug by the rangatira (chief) Rakaihautu. Rakaihautu was the captain of the canoe, Uruao, which brought the tribe, Waitaha, to New Zealand. Rakaihautu beached his canoe at Whakatū (Nelson). From Whakatū, Rakaihautu divided the new arrivals in two, with his son taking one party to explore the coastline southwards and Rakaihautu taking another southwards by an inland route. On his inland journey southward, Rakaihautu used his famous kō (a tool similar to a spade) to dig the principal lakes of Te Wai Pounamu, including Pūkaki.

For Ngāi Tahu, traditions such as this represent the links between the cosmological world of the gods and present generations, these histories reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

Pūkaki is referred to in Ngāi Tahu tradition as the basin that captures the tears of Aoraki: a reference to the meltwaters that flow from Aoraki into the lake in the spring time.

As well as its association with Aoraki, Pūkaki is also a mahinga kai, noted particularly for its water fowl. The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the lake, the relationship of people with the lake and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

The mauri of Pūkaki represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the lake.

##### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

Pursuant to [section 215][241], and without limiting the rest of this schedule, the only purposes of this statutory acknowledgement are---
    
*   (a) to require that consent authorities forward summaries of resource consent applications to Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu as required by regulations made pursuant to [section 207][233] (clause 12.2.3 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (b) to require that consent authorities, Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga, or the Environment Court, as the case may be, have regard to this statutory acknowledgement in relation to Lake Pūkaki, as provided in [sections 208 to 210][234] (clause 12.2.4 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (c) to empower the Minister responsible for management of Lake Pūkaki or the Commissioner of Crown Lands, as the case may be, to enter into a Deed of Recognition as provided in [section 212][238] (clause 12.2.6 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (d) to enable Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu and any member of Ngāi Tahu Whānui to cite this statutory acknowledgement as evidence of the association of Ngāi Tahu to Lake Pūkaki as provided in [section 211][237] (clause 12.2.5 of the deed of settlement).

## Schedule 35  
Statutory acknowledgement for Lake Rotorua

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the lake known as Rotorua, the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 43 (SO 7327).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Rotorua, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Rotorua

Rotorua is one of the lakes referred to in the tradition of ""Ngā Puna Wai Karikari o Rakaihautu"" which tells of how the principal lakes of Te Wai Pounamu were dug by the rangatira (chief) Rakaihautu. Rakaihautu was the captain of the canoe, Uruao, which brought the Waitaha tribe to New Zealand. According to tradition, Rakaihautu beached his canoe at Whakatū (Nelson). From Whakatū, Rakaihautu divided the new arrivals in two, with his son taking one party to explore the coastline southwards, and Rakaihautu taking another southwards by an inland route.

On his journey inland Rakaihautu used his famous kō (a tool similar to a spade) to dig what are now the principal lakes of Te Wai Pounamu. Those lakes included Whakamatau (Coleridge), Rotorua, Pūkaki, Ōhau, Wanaka, Takapo and Hawea. All of these lakes were used by Ngāi Tahu as mahinga kai and sites of occupation.

For Ngāi Tahu, traditions such as this represent the links between the cosmological world of the gods and present generations, these histories reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

Rotorua was used as a mahinga kai by Ngāi Tahu as well as the earlier tribes such as Ngāti Tumatakokiri and Ngāti Wairaki. The main foods taken from this area were waterfowl and eel.

The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the lake, the relationship of people with the lake and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the lake.

## Schedule 36  
Statutory acknowledgement for Lake Wanaka

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the lake known as Wanaka, the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 38 (SO 24719).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Lake Wanaka, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Lake Wanaka

Wanaka is one of the lakes referred to in the tradition of ""Ngā Puna Wai Karikari o Rakaihautu"" which tells how the principal lakes of Te Wai Pounamu were dug by the rangatira (chief) Rakaihautu. Rakaihautu was the captain of the canoe, Uruao, which brought the tribe, Waitaha, to New Zealand. Rakaihautu beached his canoe at Whakatū (Nelson). From Whakatū, Rakaihautu divided the new arrivals in two, with his son taking one party to explore the coastline southwards and Rakaihautu taking another southwards by an inland route. On his inland journey southward, Rakaihautu used his famous kō (a tool similar to a spade) to dig the principal lakes of Te Wai Pounamu, including Wanaka.

For Ngāi Tahu, traditions such as this represent the links between the cosmological world of the gods and present generations, these histories reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

The name ""Wanaka"" is considered by some to be a South Island variant of the word ""wānanga"" which refers to the ancient schools of learning. In these schools Ngāi Tahu tohunga (men of learning) would be taught whakapapa (genealogies) which stretched back to over a hundred generations and karakia (incantations) for innumerable situations. All of this learning they would be required to commit to memory.

Wanaka was traditionally noted as a rich tuna (eel) fishery, with many thousands of the fish once being caught, preserved and transported back to the kainga nohoanga (settlements) of coastal Otago.

The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of Wanaka, the relationship of people with the lake and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

In 1836 an eeling party was attacked by Te Puoho, a rangatira (chief) of the North Island Ngāti Tama iwi. Te Puoho had plans of conquering Te Wai Pounamu, beginning his campaign at the southern end of the island. He compared his strategy to boning an eel which is started at the tail end of the fish. Having travelled down Te Tai Poutini (the West Coast) to Jackson Bay, Te Puoho crossed Haast Past into Wanaka and Lake Hawea where he found a Ngāi Tahu eeling party which he captured at Makarora. Two infant girls were captured and eaten. Te Puoho suspected this family was an outpost and so he gave instructions for two guards to follow a young teenager called Pukuharuru who was ordered to show them where the main camp was. However, Pukuharuru managed to escape after dark and alert his father, Te Raki. Te Raki killed the two guards, who were lost without their guide, and the Wanaka families managed to escape the region.

Te Puoho continued his campaign at Tuturau where there were other families fishing. However, some of the people managed to escape to Tiwai Point near Bluff where they lit a warning fire. This fire alerted the southern forces and, under the leadership of Tuhawaiki, Ngāi Tahu prepared to meet Te Puoho at Tuturau. After discussing the situation with the tohunga, Ngāi Tahu were assured of victory. While the priests chanted their karakia to the gods of war, the heart of the enemy chief appeared before Ngāi Tahu in the firelight, carried by the wings of a bird. With this omen that the gods of war were on the side of Ngāi Tahu, they attacked Te Puoho the next morning.

Te Puoho was shot by a young Ngāi Tahu called Topi and his army was taken captive. The head of Te Puoho was cut from his body and stuck on a pole facing his home in the north. Wanaka is therefore noted in history for its part in what was to be the last battle between North and South Island tribes.

The mauri of Wanaka represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the lake.

## Schedule 37  
Statutory acknowledgement for Mahi Tīkumu (Lake Aviemore)

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the lake known as Mahi Tīkumu (Lake Aviemore), the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 492 (SO 19907 (Canterbury Land District) and SO 24731 (Otago Land District)).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Mahi Tīkumu, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Mahi Tīkumu

While the man-made Mahi Tīkumu is obviously a comparatively recent creation on the landscape, it overlays the path of the Waitaki River, which is very significant to Ngāi Tahu as the pathway of the waters from Aoraki to the sea. Ngāi Tahu Whānui always recognise and pay respects to Waitaki as a significant element of their being and identity, a creation of the atua (gods), further moulded by Tū Te Rakiwhānoa and his assistants, one of whom was Marokura who stocked the waterways.

In addition, the lake now covers areas which have been very important in Ngāi Tahu history. A number of nohoanga existed along the former river basin, among the 170 which one record lists as existing in the Waitaki basin.

Many wāhi tapu and wāhi taonga were also drowned by Mahi Tīkumu, including a number of rock art sites. Other areas of the lake's catchment are awaiting survey for rock art. Urupā associated with the nohoanga in the area also lie under the lake. These are the resting places of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna and, as such, are the focus for whānau traditions. These are places holding the memories, traditions, victories and defeats of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna, and are frequently protected by secret locations.

An important and productive tuna (eel) fishery existed in the lake, although in more recent times the customary fishery has become depleted. Freshwater mussels (waikākahi) are also available in the shallows. Excellent stands of raupō grow on the edge of the lake, adjacent to the deep water. This hardy plant, which was traditionally used for kai and in the making of mōkihi (a type of waka, or canoe, used on inland waterways) is not affected by the heavy frosts of the area or cattle grazing.

The area which the lake now covers was once a major route from coast to coast: to Hawea and Wanaka via the Lindis pass, and to the West Coast via Ōkuru or Haast Pass. There was also a trail via the Lindis through into the Central Otago summer resorts, mahinga kai and pounamu resources. Trails linked to seasonal resource gathering lead into the Ōhau, Pūkaki and Takapo, Alexandrina and Whakarukumoana catchments.

The area covered by the lake was an integral part of a network of trails which were used in order to ensure the safest journey and incorporated locations along the way that were identified for activities including camping overnight and gathering kai. Knowledge of these trails continues to be held by whānau and hapū and is regarded as a taonga. The traditional mobile lifestyle of the people led to their dependence on the resources of the land and waterways.

Wai-para-hoanga, meaning literally ""water of grinding stone dirt"" is a descriptive name for the water that once flowed unhindered in the Waitaki, sourced from Pūkaki, Takapo and Ōhau, and ultimately from Aoraki itself.

Notwithstanding more recent man-made changes to the landscape and waterways, the mauri of Mahi Tīkumu represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the lake.

##### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

Pursuant to [section 215][241], and without limiting the rest of this schedule, the only purposes of this statutory acknowledgement are---
    
*   (a) to require that consent authorities forward summaries of resource consent applications to Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu as required by regulations made pursuant to [section 207][233] (clause 12.2.3 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (b) to require that consent authorities, Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga, or the Environment Court, as the case may be, have regard to this statutory acknowledgement in relation to Mahi Tīkumu, as provided in [sections 208 to 210][234] (clause 12.2.4 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (c) to empower the Minister responsible for management of Mahi Tīkumu or the Commissioner of Crown Lands, as the case may be, to enter into a Deed of Recognition as provided in [section 212][238] (clause 12.2.6 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (d) to enable Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu and any member of Ngāi Tahu Whānui to cite this statutory acknowledgement as evidence of the association of Ngāi Tahu to Mahi Tīkumu as provided in [section 211][237] (clause 12.2.5 of the deed of settlement).

##### Limitations on effect of statutory acknowledgement

Except as expressly provided in [sections 208 to 211][234], [213][239], and [215][241],---
    
*   (a) this statutory acknowledgement does not affect, and is not to be taken into account in, the exercise of any power, duty, or function by any person or entity under any statute, regulation, or bylaw; and

*   (b) without limiting paragraph (a), no person or entity, in considering any matter or making any decision or recommendation under any statute, regulation, or bylaw, may give any greater or lesser weight to Ngāi Tahu's association to Mahi Tīkumu (as described in this statutory acknowledgement) than that person or entity would give under the relevant statute, regulation, or bylaw, if this statutory acknowledgement did not exist in respect of Mahi Tīkumu.

Except as expressly provided in this Act, this statutory acknowledgement does not affect the lawful rights or interests of any person who is not a party to the deed of settlement.

Except as expressly provided in this Act, this statutory acknowledgement does not, of itself, have the effect of granting, creating, or providing evidence of any estate or interest in, or any rights of any kind whatsoever relating to, Mahi Tīkumu.

## Schedule 38  
Statutory acknowledgement for Makaawhio (Jacobs River)

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the river known as Makaawhio (Jacobs River), the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 111 (SO 12514).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to the Makaawhio, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with the Makaawhio

According to legend, the Makaawhio River is associated with the Patupaiarehe (flute playing fairies) and Maeroero (ogres of the forest). It is said that Tikitiki o Rehua was slain in the Makaawhio River by the Maeroero. The name ""Tikitiki o Rehua"" is now attached to the ridge of hills (sometimes called Jacobs Ridge) on the north bank of the Makaawhio River.

For Ngāi Tahu, traditions such as this represent the links between the cosmological world of the gods and present generations, these histories reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

Manawhenua (tribal authority over the area) was gained through Ngāi Tahu's defeat of Ngāti Wairaki and Tūmatakokiri. That manawhenua was cemented by the establishment of kāinga nohoanga (permanent settlements) at the mouth and on both banks of the river because of the plentiful supply of mahinga kai from the river and its estuary and surrounds. A northern settlement strategically sited on Tahekeakai (Jacobs Bluff) acted as a sentry lookout that warned of approaching visitors.

As a result of this pattern of occupation, there are a number of urupā and wāhi tapu along the river. Urupā are the resting places of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna and, as such, are the focus for whānau traditions. Urupā and wāhi tapu are places holding the memories, traditions, victories and defeats of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna, and are frequently protected by secret locations.

The Makaawhio was and still is the source of a range of mahinga kai. Rocks at the mouth of the river still provide an abundance of kaimoana (seafood). The estuary of the river itself still provides an abundance of kaiawa (freshwater fisheries), including tuna (eels), pātiki (flounders) and inaka (whitebait) and remains a significant kōhanga (nursery) for a variety of fish species.

The area is still a significant manu (bird) breeding area, once yielding a rich harvest. The flora of the area provided not only food, but also the raw materials for rāranga (weaving), rongoa (medicines) and the building of waka (canoes) and whare (houses).

In addition to its bounty of mahinga kai resources, the Makaawhio is a source of the mineral kyanite (Aotea).

The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the river, the relationship of people with the river and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

Because of the kāinga nohoanga, reserves were set aside on the river for Ngāi Tahu at the time of the 1860 Arahura Deed of Sale. One of these was an urupā, where notable Ngāi Tahu tūpuna Te Koeti Turanga and Wi Katau Te Naihi are buried, among others.

The mauri of the Makaawhio represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the river.

##### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

*   (c) to empower the Minister responsible for management of the Makaawhio or the Commissioner of Crown Lands, as the case may be, to enter into a Deed of Recognition as provided in [section 212][238] (clause 12.2.6 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (d) to enable Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu and any member of Ngāi Tahu Whānui to cite this statutory acknowledgement as evidence of the association of Ngāi Tahu to the Makaawhio as provided in [section 211][237] (clause 12.2.5 of the deed of settlement).

## Schedule 39  
Statutory acknowledgement for Manawapōpōre/Hikuraki (Mavora Lakes)

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the wetland known as Manawapōpōre/Hikuraki (Mavora Lakes), the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 44 (SO 12235).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Manawapōpōre/Hikuraki, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Manawapōpōre/Hikuraki

Manawapōpōre and Hikuraki are part of one of the most significant catchments in Murihiku (Southland). The wetland also lies in the path of the important trail from the mouth of the Ōreti River onward, via the Greenstone Valley, to the head of Whakatipu-wai-māori (Lake Wakatipu), or alternatively continuing along the Greenstone Valley and out via the Hollyford to the West Coast. These were important trading routes, to gather pounamu for exchange with northern iwi for materials and foods unavailable in the south.

The wetland area was, therefore, an integral part of a network of trails which were used in order to ensure the safest journey and incorporated locations along the way that were identified for activities including camping overnight and gathering kai. Knowledge of these trails continues to be held by whānau and hapū and is regarded as a taonga. The traditional mobile lifestyle of the people led to their dependence on the resources of the area.

In addition, the trails were part of summer time pursuits such as kai-hau-kai, whānaungatanga (the renewal and strengthening of family links) and arranging marriages with hapū from the neighbouring region of Otago and further afield. Such strategic marriages between hapū strengthened the kupenga (net) of whakapapa and thus rights to use the resources of the area.

Manawapōpōre (Lower Mavora) is noted for eel weirs, which were constructed on the lake edges for catching eels, utilising flat stones, built in a loop out from the lake edge, with gaps at either end and one in the middle. Construction of the eel weir recreates the type of environment that eels like to congregate in, hence reliable catches are made.

The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of such techniques, places for catching and gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the area, the relationship of people with the area and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

The mauri of Manawapōpōre/Hikuraki represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the area.

##### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

Pursuant to [section 215][241], and without limiting the rest of this schedule, the only purposes of this statutory acknowledgement are---
    
*   (a) to require that consent authorities forward summaries of resource consent applications to Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu as required by regulations made pursuant to [section 207][233] (clause 12.2.3 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (b) to require that consent authorities, Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga, or the Environment Court, as the case may be, have regard to this statutory acknowledgement in relation to Manawapōpōre/ Hikuraki, as provided in [sections 208 to 210][234] (clause 12.2.4 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (c) to empower the Minister responsible for management of Manawapōpōre/Hikuraki or the Commissioner of Crown Lands, as the case may be, to enter into a Deed of Recognition as provided in [section 212][238] (clause 12.2.6 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (d) to enable Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu and any member of Ngāi Tahu Whānui to cite this statutory acknowledgement as evidence of the association of Ngāi Tahu to Manawapōpōre/Hikuraki as provided in [section 211][237] (clause 12.2.5 of the deed of settlement).

##### Limitations on effect of statutory acknowledgement

Except as expressly provided in [sections 208 to 211][234], [213][239], and [215][241],---
    
*   (a) this statutory acknowledgement does not affect, and is not to be taken into account in, the exercise of any power, duty, or function by any person or entity under any statute, regulation, or bylaw; and

*   (b) without limiting paragraph (a), no person or entity, in considering any matter or making any decision or recommendation under any statute, regulation, or bylaw, may give any greater or lesser weight to Ngāi Tahu's association to Manawapōpōre/Hikuraki (as described in this statutory acknowledgement) than that person or entity would give under the relevant statute, regulation, or bylaw, if this statutory acknowledgement did not exist in respect of Manawapōpōre/Hikuraki.

Except as expressly provided in this Act, this statutory acknowledgement does not affect the lawful rights or interests of any person who is not a party to the deed of settlement.

Except as expressly provided in this Act, this statutory acknowledgement does not, of itself, have the effect of granting, creating, or providing evidence of any estate or interest in, or any rights of any kind whatsoever relating to, Manawapōpōre/Hikuraki.

## Schedule 40  
Statutory acknowledgement for Mata-au (Clutha River)

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the river known as Mata-au (Clutha River), the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 122 (SO 24727).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to the Mata-au, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with the Mata-au

The Mata-au river takes its name from a Ngāi Tahu whakapapa that traces the genealogy of water. On that basis, the Mata-au is seen as a descendant of the creation traditions. For Ngāi Tahu, traditions such as this represent the links between the cosmological world of the gods and present generations, these histories reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

On another level, the Mata-au was part of a mahinga kai trail that led inland and was used by Ōtākou hapū including Ngāti Kurī, Ngāti Ruahikihiki, Ngāti Huirapa and Ngāi Tuahuriri. The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the river, the relationship of people with the river and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

The river was also very important in the transportation of pounamu from inland areas down to settlements on the coast, from where it was traded north and south. Thus there were numerous tauranga waka (landing places) along it. The tūpuna had an intimate knowledge of navigation, river routes, safe harbours and landing places, and the locations of food and other resources on the river. The river was an integral part of a network of trails which were used in order to ensure the safest journey and incorporated locations along the way that were identified for activities including camping overnight and gathering kai. Knowledge of these trails continues to be held by whānau and hapū and is regarded as a taonga. The traditional mobile lifestyle of the people led to their dependence on the resources of the river.

The Mata-au is where Ngāi Tahu's leader, Te Hautapunui o Tū, established the boundary line between Ngāi Tahu and Ngāti Mamoe. Ngāti Mamoe were to hold mana (authority) over the lands south of the river and Ngāi Tahu were to hold mana northwards. Eventually, the unions between the families of Te Hautapunui o Tū and Ngāti Mamoe were to overcome these boundaries. For Ngāi Tahu, histories such as this represent the links and continuity between past and present generations, reinforce tribal identity, and document the events which shaped Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

Strategic marriages between hapū further strengthened the kupenga (net) of whakapapa, and thus rights to travel on and use the resources of the river. It is because of these patterns of activity that the river continues to be important to rūnanga located in Otago and beyond. These rūnanga carry the responsibilities of kaitiaki in relation to the area, and are represented by the tribal structure, Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu.

Urupā and battlegrounds are located all along this river. One battleground, known as Te Kauae Whakatoro (downstream of Tuapeka), recalls a confrontation between Ngāi Tahu and Ngāti Mamoe that led to the armistice established by Te Hautapunui o Tū. Urupā are the resting places of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna and, as such, are the focus for whānau traditions. These are places holding the memories, traditions, victories and defeats of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna, and are frequently protected by secret locations.

The mauri of Mata-au represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the river.

##### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

Pursuant to [section 215][241], and without limiting the rest of this schedule, the only purposes of this statutory acknowledgement are---
    
*   (a) to require that consent authorities forward summaries of resource consent applications to Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu as required by regulations made pursuant to [section 207][233] (clause 12.2.3 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (b) to require that consent authorities, Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga, or the Environment Court, as the case may be, have regard to this statutory acknowledgement in relation to the Mata-au, as provided in [sections 208 to 210][234] (clause 12.2.4 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (c) to empower the Minister responsible for management of the Mata-au or the Commissioner of Crown Lands, as the case may be, to enter into a Deed of Recognition as provided in [section 212][238] (clause 12.2.6 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (d) to enable Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu and any member of Ngāi Tahu Whānui to cite this statutory acknowledgement as evidence of the association of Ngāi Tahu to the Mata-au as provided in [section 211][237] (clause 12.2.5 of the deed of settlement).

##### Limitations on effect of statutory acknowledgement

Except as expressly provided in [sections 208 to 211][234], [213][239], and [215][241],---
    
*   (a) this statutory acknowledgement does not affect, and is not to be taken into account in, the exercise of any power, duty, or function by any person or entity under any statute, regulation, or bylaw; and

*   (b) without limiting paragraph (a), no person or entity, in considering any matter or making any decision or recommendation under any statute, regulation, or bylaw, may give any greater or lesser weight to Ngāi Tahu's association to the Mata-au (as described in this statutory acknowledgement) than that person or entity would give under the relevant statute, regulation, or bylaw, if this statutory acknowledgement did not exist in respect of the Mata-au.

Except as expressly provided in this Act, this statutory acknowledgement does not affect the lawful rights or interests of any person who is not a party to the deed of settlement.

Except as expressly provided in this Act, this statutory acknowledgement does not, of itself, have the effect of granting, creating, or providing evidence of any estate or interest in, or any rights of any kind whatsoever relating to, the Mata-au.

## Schedule 41  
Statutory acknowledgement for Matakaea (Shag Point)

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the area known as Matakaea Recreation Reserve and Onewhenua Historic Reserve, as shown on Allocation Plan MS 9 (SO 24686).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Matakaea.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Matakaea

The name Matakaea recalls the tradition of the Arai Te Uru canoe, which capsized off Moeraki. From Moeraki, the crew managed to swim ashore, leaving the cargo to be taken ashore by the waves. The crew members fled inland and were transformed into the mountains which form the Southern Alps.

The Arai Te Uru tradition is also important because it explains the origins of kūmara. The story originally began with Roko i Tua who came to Aotearoa and met the Kāhui Tipua. The Kāhui Tipua gave Roko i Tua mamaku (tree fern) to eat. However Roko i Tua preferred the kūmara that he had in his belt which he took out and soaked in a bowl of water. The Kāhui Tipua tasted the kūmara and asked where it was from. Roko i Tua replied saying that the kūmara came from ""across the sea"".

The Kāhui Tipua then made a canoe and, under the leadership of Tū Kākāriki, went to Hawaiiki and returned with the kūmara to Aotearoa. The Kāhui Tipua planted the kūmara but the crop failed. However, Roko i Tua had also sailed to Hawaiiki on the canoe called Arai Te Uru. Roko i Tua landed at Whangarā, Hawaiiki, and learnt the karakia (incantations) and tikanga (customs) connected with planting kūmara. Roko i Tua then gave his canoe to two crew members called Pakihiwitahi and Hape ki Tua Raki. The Arai Te Uru returned under the leadership of these two commanders and eventually foundered off the Moeraki Coast at Matakaea.

For Ngāi Tahu, traditions such as this represent the links between the cosmological world of the gods and present generations, these histories reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

The Matakaea area has been occupied for many centuries and is the site of numerous urupā and wāhi tapu. Urupā are the resting places of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna (ancestors) and, as such, are the focus for whānau traditions. Urupā and wāhi tapu are places holding the memories, traditions, victories and defeats of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna, and are frequently protected by secret locations.

The mauri of Matakaea represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the area.

##### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

Pursuant to [section 215][241], and without limiting the rest of this schedule, the only purposes of this statutory acknowledgement are---
    
*   (a) to require that consent authorities forward summaries of resource consent applications to Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu as required by regulations made pursuant to [section 207][233] (clause 12.2.3 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (b) to require that consent authorities, Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga, or the Environment Court, as the case may be, have regard to this statutory acknowledgement in relation to Matakaea, as provided in [sections 208 to 210][234] (clause 12.2.4 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (c) to empower the Minister responsible for management of Matakaea or the Commissioner of Crown Lands, as the case may be, to enter into a Deed of Recognition as provided in [section 212][238] (clause 12.2.6 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (d) to enable Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu and any member of Ngāi Tahu Whānui to cite this statutory acknowledgement as evidence of the association of Ngāi Tahu to Matakaea as provided in [section 211][237] (clause 12.2.5 of the deed of settlement).

## Schedule 42  
Statutory acknowledgement for Mataura River

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the river known as Mataura, the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 125 (SO 12264).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to the Mataura River, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with the Mataura River

The area of the Mataura River above the Mataura Falls was traditionally used by the descendants of the Ngāti Mamoe chief, Parapara Te Whenua. The descendants of Parapara Te Whenua incorporate the lines of Ngāti Kurī from which the Mamaru family of Moeraki descend. Another famous tupuna associated with the river was Kiritekateka, the daughter of Parapara Te Whenua. Kiritekateka was captured by Ngāi Tahu at Te Anau and her descendants make up the lines of many of the Ngāi Tahu families at Ōtākou.

For Ngāi Tahu, histories such as these reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

The Mataura was an important mahinga kai, noted for its indigenous fishery. The Mataura Falls were particularly associated with the taking of kanakana (lamprey). The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of Mataura, the relationship of people with the river and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

The mauri of the Mataura represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the river.

##### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

Statutory acknowledgement for Moana Rua (Lake Pearson)

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the wetland known as Moana Rua (Lake Pearson), the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 51 (SO 19840).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Moana Rua, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Moana Rua

The wetland area known to Pākehā as Lake Pearson is known to Ngāi Tahu as Moana Rua. The area falls along the route across the main divide which is now known as Arthurs Pass. The area was an integral part of a network of trails which were used in order to ensure the safest journey and incorporated locations along the way that were identified for activities including camping overnight and gathering kai. Knowledge of these trails continues to be held by whānau and hapū and is regarded as a taonga. The traditional mobile lifestyle of the people led to their dependence on the resources of the area.

This area was primarily used as a mahinga kai by Canterbury Ngāi Tahu, with weka, kākāpō and tuna (eels) being the main foods taken. The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the land, the relationship of people with the land and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

Several urupā are recorded in this immediate area. Urupā are the resting places of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna and, as such, are the focus for whānau traditions. These are places holding the memories, traditions, victories and defeats of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna, and are frequently protected by secret locations.

The mauri of Moana Rua represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the area.

## Schedule 44  
Statutory acknowledgement for Motupōhue (Bluff Hill)

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the area known as Motupōhue (Bluff Hill), as shown on Allocation Plan MS 8 (SO 12233).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Motupōhue as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Motupōhue

The name Motupōhue is an ancient one, brought south by Ngāti Mamoe and Ngāi Tahu from the Hawkes Bay region where both tribes originated. The name recalls a history unique to the Ngāi Tuhaitara and Ngāti Kurī hapū that is captured in the line, ""Kei korā kei Motupōhue, he pāreka e kai ana, nā tō tūtae"" (""It was there at Motupōhue that a shag stood, eating your excrement"").

Oral traditions say that the Ngāti Mamoe leader, Te Rakitauneke, is buried upon this hill. Te Rakitauneke's saying was: ""Kia pai ai tāku titiro ki Te Ara a Kiwa"" (""Let me gaze upon Foveaux Strait""). Some traditions also place another Ngāti Mamoe leader, Tū Te Makohu, on this hill.

For Ngāi Tahu, histories such as this represent the links and continuity between past and present generations, reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and document the events which shaped Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

The mauri of Motupōhue represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with Motupōhue.

##### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

Pursuant to [section 215][241], and without limiting the rest of this schedule, the only purposes of this statutory acknowledgement are---

## Schedule 45  
Statutory acknowledgement for Moturau (Lake Manapōuri)

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the lake known as Moturau (Lake Manapōuri), the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 40 (SO 12257).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Moturau, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Moturau

Moturau (or Motu-ua) is one of the lakes referred to in the tradition of ""Ngā Puna Wai Karikari o Rakaihautu"" which tells how the principal lakes of Te Wai Pounamu were dug by the rangatira (chief) Rakaihautu. Rakaihautu was the captain of the canoe, Uruao, which brought the tribe, Waitaha, to New Zealand. Rakaihautu beached his canoe at Whakatū (Nelson). From Whakatū, Rakaihautu divided the new arrivals in two, with his son taking one party to explore the coastline southwards and Rakaihautu taking another southwards by an inland route. On his inland journey southward, Rakaihautu used his famous kō (a tool similar to a spade) to dig the principal lakes of Te Wai Pounamu, including Moturau. Rakaihautu named the lake Motu-ua, a reference to the persistent rain which troubled his party here.

Tamatea and his party passed this way in their journey back to their homeland after their waka, Takitimu, broke its back at the mouth of the Waiau River. It was Tamatea who named the lake Moturau (possibly a woman's name but more likely to relate to the many islands found in the lake). Tamatea's party established a camp on the edge of the lake, which is probably under water now, and called it Whitiaka-te-rā (the shining of the sun), indicating that they enjoyed a very different experience of the lake from Rakaihautu. Other traditional names associated with the lake include Te Māui (North Arm), Te Tukeroa (Beehive), Manapōuri (north-eastern reach), Wairoa River (upper Waiau River), Te Rakatū (Garnock Burn), Te Konuotu-te-Makohu (Monument), and Huatea (South Arm).

For Ngāi Tahu, traditions such as this represent the links between the cosmological world of the gods and present generations, these histories reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

A number of wāhi taonga and nohoanga associated with the lake are now under its waters. Eel weirs have been found at the Monument and Hope Arm of the lake, and there was a canoe manufacturing site at Pigeon Island. Such wāhi taonga are places holding the memories, traditions, victories and defeats of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna.

As a mahinga kai, the lake was important for the fowling it offered Murihiku coastal settlements in summer. The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka (landing places), places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of Moturau, the relationship of people with the lake and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

The mauri of Moturau represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the lake.

##### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

Pursuant to [section 215][241], and without limiting the rest of this schedule, the only purposes of this statutory acknowledgement are---

Except as expressly provided in this Act, this statutory acknowledgement does not affect the lawful rights or interests of any person who is not a party to the deed of settlement.

Except as expressly provided in this Act, this statutory acknowledgement does not, of itself, have the effect of granting, creating, or providing evidence of any estate or interest in, or any rights of any kind whatsoever relating to, Moturau.

## Schedule 46  
Statutory acknowledgement for Ō Tū Wharekai (Ashburton Lakes)

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the wetland known as Ō Tū Wharekai (Ashburton Lakes), the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 53 (SO 19841).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Ō Tū Wharekai, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Ō Tū Wharekai

The creation of the Ō Tū Wharekai wetlands is associated with Tū Te Rakiwhānoa and his shaping of Te Wai Pounamu (the South Island) to make it habitable for humans. The Ō Tū Wharekai complex was created as Tū Te Rakiwhānoa arranged the debris in the Waka o Aoraki while forming the harbours and plains and heaping up mountains of the interior.

For Ngāi Tahu, traditions such as this represent the links between the cosmological world of the gods and present generations, these histories reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

The name Ō Tū Wharekai actually relates to the part of the complex known as the Māori Lakes. The other lakes and wetlands which make up the complex also have their own names.

Important nohoanga (settlements) associated with seasonal mahinga kai gathering and travel to and through this area included: Tūtaewera, Hatere, Uhi, Matakou, Kirihonuhonu, Ōtautari, Punataka, Te Kiakia, and Tamatakou.

The complex was a part of the seasonal trail of mahinga kai and resource gathering, and hapū and whānau bonding. Knowledge of these trails continues to be held by whānau and hapū and is regarded as a taonga. The traditional mobile lifestyle of the people led to their dependence on the resources of the wetlands. Mahinga kai resources taken from the area included: tuna (eels), weka, kākā, kererū, tūī, pūkeko and other waterfowl, aruhe, kiore, kauru, mataī and pōkākā.

The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the wetlands, the relationship of people with the area and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

The mauri of Ō Tū Wharekai represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the area.

##### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

Pursuant to [section 215][241], and without limiting the rest of this schedule, the only purposes of this statutory acknowledgement are---
    
*   (a) to require that consent authorities forward summaries of resource consent applications to Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu as required by regulations made pursuant to [section 207][233] (clause 12.2.3 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (b) to require that consent authorities, Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga, or the Environment Court, as the case may be, have regard to this statutory acknowledgement in relation to Ō Tū Wharekai, as provided in [sections 208 to 210][234] (clause 12.2.4 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (c) to empower the Minister responsible for management of Ō Tū Wharekai or the Commissioner of Crown Lands, as the case may be, to enter into a Deed of Recognition as provided in [section 212][238] (clause 12.2.6 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (d) to enable Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu and any member of Ngāi Tahu Whānui to cite this statutory acknowledgement as evidence of the association of Ngāi Tahu to Ō Tū Wharekai as provided in [section 211][237] (clause 12.2.5 of the deed of settlement).

##### Limitations on effect of statutory acknowledgement

Except as expressly provided in [sections 208 to 211][234], [213][239], and [215][241],---

*   (b) without limiting paragraph (a), no person or entity, in considering any matter or making any decision or recommendation under any statute, regulation, or bylaw, may give any greater or lesser weight to Ngāi Tahu's association to Ō Tū Wharekai (as described in this statutory acknowledgement) than that person or entity would give under the relevant statute, regulation, or bylaw, if this statutory acknowledgement did not exist in respect of Ō Tū Wharekai.

## Schedule 47  
Statutory acknowledgement for Ōkari Lagoon

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the wetland known as Ōkari Lagoon, the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 49 (SO 15494).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Ōkari Lagoon, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Ōkari Lagoon

Manawhenua (tribal authority over the area) was gained through Ngāi Tahu's defeat of Ngāti Wairaki, Tūmatakōkiri and Ngāti Toa. For Ngāi Tahu, histories such as this reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

This hāpua (estuary) once supported a number of significant kāinga nohoanga (settlements) including Tauraka, Ōmau, Ōweka, Ōrowaiti, Te Kuha, Ōrikaka, Waimakaroa and Whareātea. As a result of this pattern of occupation, there are a number of recorded and unrecorded archaeological sites associated with Ōkari, including middens. Such sites are a focus for memories of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna and, as such, are wāhi taonga to the descendants of those tūpuna.

Ōkari was and still is a significant spawning ground and kōhanga (nursery) for a variety of fish species and a significant breeding area for manu (birds). The lagoon remains a source of rich and abundant harvests.

The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the lagoon, the relationship of people with the lagoon and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

As a mark of the significance of the area as a mahinga kai and because of the kainga nohoanga, a reserve was set aside for Ngāi Tahu in this area at the time of the 1860 Arahura Deed of Sale.

The mauri of Ōkari represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the lagoon.

##### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

Pursuant to [section 215][241], and without limiting the rest of this schedule, the only purposes of this statutory acknowledgement are---
    
*   (a) to require that consent authorities forward summaries of resource consent applications to Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu as required by regulations made pursuant to [section 207][233] (clause 12.2.3 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (b) to require that consent authorities, Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga, or the Environment Court, as the case may be, have regard to this statutory acknowledgement in relation to Ōkari Lagoon, as provided in [sections 208 to 210][234] (clause 12.2.4 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (c) to empower the Minister responsible for management of Ōkari Lagoon or the Commissioner of Crown Lands, as the case may be, to enter into a Deed of Recognition as provided in [section 212][238] (clause 12.2.6 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (d) to enable Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu and any member of Ngāi Tahu Whānui to cite this statutory acknowledgement as evidence of the association of Ngāi Tahu to Ōkari Lagoon as provided in [section 211][237] (clause 12.2.5 of the deed of settlement).

##### Limitations on effect of statutory acknowledgement

Except as expressly provided in [sections 208 to 211][234], [213][239], and [215][241],---

## Schedule 48  
Statutory acknowledgement for Ōkārito Lagoon

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the wetland known as Ōkārito Lagoon, the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 47 (SO 12510).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Ōkārito Lagoon, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Ōkārito Lagoon

The Ōkārito Lagoon area was traditionally occupied by the Ngāti Wairaki and Rapuwai hapū before Ngāi Tahu gained manawhenua (tribal authority over the area). The area was important as the site of the Ngāti Wairaki Whare Wānanga. It was to this wānanga that the Ngāi Tahu rangatira (chiefs) went so as to learn the whakapapa to the South Island. For Ngāi Tahu, histories such as this reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped the environment of Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

Ōkārito is well known as the place occupied by the kōtuku (white heron) and there are many Ngāi Tahu waiata (songs) that tell the tale of the kōtuku.

The lagoon was also a rich mahinga kai. The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the lagoon, the relationship of people with the lagoon and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

## Schedule 49  
Statutory acknowledgement for Ōrakipaoa Wetland

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the wetland known as Ōrakipaoa, the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 54 (SO 19842).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Ōrakipaoa, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Ōrakipaoa

The creation of the Ōrakipaoa wetlands is associated with Tū Te Rakiwhānoa and his shaping of the island to make it habitable for humans. Ōrakipaoa was created as Tū Te Rakiwhānoa arranged the debris from the Waka o Aoraki while forming the harbours and plains and heaping up mountains of the interior.

For Ngāi Tahu, traditions such as this represent the links between the cosmological world of the gods and present generations, these histories reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

One of the first explorers recorded in the area was Rakaihouia, son of Rakaihautu, who was given the task of exploring the east coast of the South Island for suitable harbours, settlement sites and food resources. Rakaihouia met up with Rakaihautu at Waihao, just to the south of Ōrakipaoa, as Rakaihautu returned overland from Murihiku. From the time of Rakaihouia, the area was occupied in succession by Waitaha, Ngāti Mamoe and Ngāi Tahu, who established a number of settlements and pā at Ōrakipaoa.

The old pā site of Te Waiaruatī was occupied as a strong defensive position during the time of Te Rauparaha and earlier periods. The kāinga of Te Rehe was on an island (Harakeke Tautoro) which was once surrounded by extensive swamplands, through which ran numerous creeks and waterways. Other pā and settlements within the Ōrakipaoa wetland complex include Ōrāhui and Hawea.

As well as being an area of permanent occupation, Ōrakipaoa formed part of numerous trails. Trails followed river valleys into the interior, as the populous settlements in the area required regular excursions to gather mahinga kai and other resources from further afield. Ōrakipaoa was also a tauranga waka and one of the stopping-off places for those travelling between Te Taumutu and Ōtākou.

The tūpuna had an intimate knowledge of navigation, river routes, safe harbours and landing places, and the locations of food and other resources on the trails. The wetlands were an integral part of a network of trails which were used in order to ensure the safest journey and incorporated locations along the way that were identified for activities including camping overnight and gathering kai. Knowledge of these trails continues to be held by whānau and hapū and is regarded as a taonga. The traditional mobile lifestyle of the people led to their dependence on the resources of the wetlands.

Mahinga kai resources were gathered from Ōrakipaoa over many generations. A wide range of mahinga kai were found within the complex, including coastal and estuarine as well as freshwater resources. The area was renowned for its eeling and bird hunting. Other fisheries for which the area was known included inaka (whitebait) and wet fish, minnows, the now-extinct grayling, giant kōkopu, flounders, mullet, and small fish known as panako, pipiki and paraki. The complex was also a source of tī kouka (cabbage tree).

The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the wetlands, the relationship of people with the area and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

The mauri of Ōrakipaoa represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the area.

The Ōreti River traverses a significant area of Murihiku, stretching from its mouth at Invercargill almost to the edge of Whakatipu-wai-māori (Lake Wakatipu). As such, it formed one of the main trails inland from the coast, with an important pounamu trade route continuing northward from the headwaters of the Ōreti and travelling, via the Mavora or Von River Valley, to the edge of Wakatipu and onto the Dart and Routeburn pounamu sources. Indeed, pounamu can be found in the upper reaches of the Ōreti itself.

The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the Ōreti, the relationship of people with the river and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

The kai resources of the Ōreti would have supported numerous parties venturing into the interior, and returning by mōkihi (vessels made of raupō), laden with pounamu and mahinga kai. Nohoanga (temporary campsites) supported such travel by providing bases from which the travellers could go water fowling, eeling and catching inaka (whitebait), and were located along the course of Ōreti River.

There were a number of important settlement sites at the mouth of the Ōreti, in the New River estuary, including Ōmāui, which was located at the mouth of the Ōreti, where it passes the New River Heads. Ōue, at the mouth of the Ōreti River (New River estuary), opposite Ōmāui, was one of the principal settlements in Murihiku. Honekai who was a principal chief of Murihiku in his time was resident at this settlement in the early 1820s, at the time of the sealers. In 1850 there were said to still be 40 people living at the kaik at Ōmāui under the chief Mauhe.

As a result of this pattern of occupation, there are a number of urupā located at the lower end of the Ōreti, in the estuarine area. Urupā are the resting places of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna and, as such, are the focus for whānau traditions. These are places holding the memories, traditions, victories and defeats of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna, and are frequently protected by secret locations.

The mauri of the Ōreti represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the river.

## Schedule 51  
Statutory acknowledgement for Pikirakatahi (Mount Earnslaw)

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the area known as Pikirakatahi (Mount Earnslaw), as shown on Allocation Plan MS 4 (SO 24666).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Pikirakatahi as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Pikirakatahi

The creation of Pikirakatahi (Mt Earnslaw) relates in time to Te Waka o Aoraki, and the efforts of Tū Te Rakiwhānoa. It is said that during its formation a wedge of pounamu was inserted into this mountain, which is the highest and most prominent peak in this block of mountains. The mountain is also linked to the travels of Rakaihautu, who dug out the great lakes of the interior with his kō (a tool similar to a spade), known as Tū Whakaroria and later renamed Tuhiraki at the conclusion of the expedition.

The origins of the name ""Pikirakatahi"" have been lost, but it is known that many places and physical features have more than one name, reflecting the traditions of the successive iwi who peopled the land. It is, however, likely that the name relates to Rakaihautu or subsequent people, as most of the prominent lakes, rivers and mountains of the interior take their name from the journey of Rakaihautu.

For Ngāi Tahu, traditions such as this represent the links between the cosmological world of the gods and present generations, these histories reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

Pikirakatahi was of crucial significance to the many generations that journeyed to that end of Whakatipu-wai-māori (Lake Wakatipu) and beyond. Staging camps for the retrieval of pounamu were located at the base of the mountain, while semi-permanent settlements related to the pounamu trade were located closer to the lake.

Pikirakatahi stands as kaitiaki (guardian) over the pounamu resource and marks the end of a trail, with the tohu (marker) to the pounamu resource sitting opposite on Koroka (Cosmos Peak). The tūpuna (ancestors) had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails, places for gathering kai (food) and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the land, the relationship of people with the land and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

The retrieval of large amounts of pounamu from this source, so far inland and over a range of physical barriers, attests to the importance of this resource to the economy and customs of the iwi over many generations. The people would also gather native birds for kai, and firewood with which to cook and provide warmth, from the forests covering the lower flanks of Pikirakatahi. Strategic marriages between hapū strengthened the kupenga (net) of whakapapa and thus rights to use the resources of the mountain. It is because of these patterns of activity that Pikirakatahi continues to be important to rūnanga located in Otago, Murihiku and beyond. These rūnanga carry the responsibilities of kaitiaki in relation to the area, and are represented by the tribal structure, Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu.

The mauri of Pikirakatahi represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with Pikirakatahi.

##### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

Pursuant to [section 215][241], and without limiting the rest of this schedule, the only purposes of this statutory acknowledgement are---
    
*   (a) to require that consent authorities forward summaries of resource consent applications to Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu as required by regulations made pursuant to [section 207][233] (clause 12.2.3 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (b) to require that consent authorities, Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga, or the Environment Court, as the case may be, have regard to this statutory acknowledgement in relation to Pikirakatahi, as provided in [sections 208 to 210][234] (clause 12.2.4 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (c) to empower the Minister responsible for management of Pikirakatahi or the Commissioner of Crown Lands, as the case may be, to enter into a Deed of Recognition as provided in [section 212][238] (clause 12.2.6 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (d) to enable Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu and any member of Ngāi Tahu Whānui to cite this statutory acknowledgement as evidence of the association of Ngāi Tahu to Pikirakatahi as provided in [section 211][237] (clause 12.2.5 of the deed of settlement).

##### Limitations on effect of statutory acknowledgement

Except as expressly provided in [sections 208 to 211][234], [213][239], and [215][241],---

Except as expressly provided in this Act, this statutory acknowledgement does not affect the lawful rights or interests of any person who is not a party to the deed of settlement.

Except as expressly provided in this Act, this statutory acknowledgement does not, of itself, have the effect of granting, creating, or providing evidence of any estate or interest in, or any rights of any kind whatsoever relating to, Pikirakatahi.

## Schedule 52  
Statutory acknowledgement for Pomahaka River

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the river known as Pomahaka, the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 12 (SO 24726).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to the Pomahaka River, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with the Pomahaka River

The Pomahaka was an important mahinga kai for Ngāti Mamoe and Ngāi Tahu kāinga (settlements) in the Catlins and Tautuku areas. The river was particularly noted for its kanakana (lamprey) fishery. Other mahinga kai associated with the river included weka and other manu (birds).

The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the Pomahaka, the relationship of people with the river and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

The mauri of the Pomahaka represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the river.

## Schedule 53  
Statutory acknowledgement for Pouerua (Saltwater Lagoon)

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the wetland known as Pouerua (Saltwater Lagoon), the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 48 (SO 12511).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Pouerua, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Pouerua

Manawhenua (tribal authority over the area) was gained through Ngāi Tahu's defeat of Ngāti Wairaki, Tūmatakōkiri and Ngāti Toa. For Ngāi Tahu, histories such as this reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

Pouerua once supported a number of significant kāinga nohoanga (settlements) including one on the lagoon itself, and others at the mouths of the Waitangi Taona, Waitangi Roto, Whataroa and Poherua Rivers. As a result of this pattern of occupation, there are urupā and archaeological sites associated with Pouerua. Urupā are the resting places of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna and, as such, are the focus for whānau traditions. These are places holding the memories, traditions, victories and defeats of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna, and are frequently protected by secret locations.

Pouerua was and still is a significant spawning ground and kōhanga (nursery) for a variety of fish species and a significant breeding area for manu (birds). The lagoon remains a source of rich and abundant harvests.

The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the lagoon, the relationship of people with the lagoon and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

As a mark of the significance of the area as a mahinga kai and because of the kāinga nohoanga, reserves were set aside for Ngāi Tahu in this area at the time of the 1860 Arahura Deed of Sale. It was at Pouerua in 1860 that the Crown agent James Mackay sealed the purchase of Te Tai Poutini (the West Coast) from the chiefs of Poutini Ngāi Tahu, although the Arahura Deed giving effect to this purchase was actually signed at Māwhera.

The mauri of Pouerua represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the lagoon.

##### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

Pursuant to [section 215][241], and without limiting the rest of this schedule, the only purposes of this statutory acknowledgement are---
    
*   (a) to require that consent authorities forward summaries of resource consent applications to Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu as required by regulations made pursuant to [section 207][233] (clause 12.2.3 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (b) to require that consent authorities, Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga, or the Environment Court, as the case may be, have regard to this statutory acknowledgement in relation to Pouerua, as provided in [sections 208 to 210][234] (clause 12.2.4 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (c) to empower the Minister responsible for management of Pouerua or the Commissioner of Crown Lands, as the case may be, to enter into a Deed of Recognition as provided in [section 212][238] (clause 12.2.6 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (d) to enable Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu and any member of Ngāi Tahu Whānui to cite this statutory acknowledgement as evidence of the association of Ngāi Tahu to Pouerua as provided in [section 211][237] (clause 12.2.5 of the deed of settlement).

##### Limitations on effect of statutory acknowledgement

Except as expressly provided in [sections 208 to 211][234], [213][239], and [215][241],---
    
*   (a) this statutory acknowledgement does not affect, and is not to be taken into account in, the exercise of any power, duty, or function by any person or entity under any statute, regulation, or bylaw; and

*   (b) without limiting paragraph (a), no person or entity, in considering any matter or making any decision or recommendation under any statute, regulation, or bylaw, may give any greater or lesser weight to Ngāi Tahu's association to Pouerua (as described in this statutory acknowledgement) than that person or entity would give under the relevant statute, regulation, or bylaw, if this statutory acknowledgement did not exist in respect of Pouerua.

Except as expressly provided in this Act, this statutory acknowledgement does not affect the lawful rights or interests of any person who is not a party to the deed of settlement.

Except as expressly provided in this Act, this statutory acknowledgement does not, of itself, have the effect of granting, creating, or providing evidence of any estate or interest in, or any rights of any kind whatsoever relating to, Pouerua.

## Schedule 54  
Statutory acknowledgement for Punatarakao Wetland

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the wetland known as Punatarakao, the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 137 (SO 19858).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Punatarakao, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Punatarakao

The Punatarakao wetland near the mouth of the Waihao river was a noted mahinga kai and traditional Ngāi Tahu occupation site. One of the principal traditions relating to the area tells that it is guarded by the taniwha, Tū Te Rakiwhānoa, who was said to appear as a sign of death.

For Ngāi Tahu, traditions such as this represent the links between the cosmological world of the gods and present generations, these histories reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

Punatarakao was the site of a Ngāi Tahu village, and was also famous for its Whare Wānanga, where tohunga went to learn. As a result of this history of occupation, there are a number of urupā and wāhi tapu in the area. Urupā are the resting places of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna and, as such, are the focus for whānau traditions. Urupā and wāhi tapu are places holding the memories, traditions, victories and defeats of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna, and are frequently protected by secret locations.

It was the mahinga kai of the Punatarakao wetland area which made it attractive as an occupation site. The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the area, the relationship of people with the area and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

The mauri of Punatarakao represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the area.

##### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

Pursuant to [section 215][241], and without limiting the rest of this schedule, the only purposes of this statutory acknowledgement are---
    
*   (a) to require that consent authorities forward summaries of resource consent applications to Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu as required by regulations made pursuant to [section 207][233] (clause 12.2.3 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (b) to require that consent authorities, Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga, or the Environment Court, as the case may be, have regard to this statutory acknowledgement in relation to Punatarakao, as provided in [sections 208 to 210][234] (clause 12.2.4 of the deed of settlement); and

## Schedule 55  
Statutory acknowledgement for Rangitata River

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the river known as Rangitata, the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 115 (SO 19851).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to the Rangitata River, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with the Rangitata River

The Rangitata was a major mahinga kai for Canterbury Ngāi Tahu. Weka and other forest birds were the main foods taken from the inland reaches of the Rangitata. Tutu berries were also taken along the waterway.

The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the river, the relationship of people with the river and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

The river was sometimes used by Ngāi Tahu parties from Canterbury as part of a trail to Te Tai Poutini (the West Coast). The tūpuna had an intimate knowledge of navigation, river routes, safe harbours and landing places, and the locations of food and other resources on the river. The river was an integral part of a network of trails which were used in order to ensure the safest journey and incorporated locations along the way that were identified for activities including camping overnight and gathering kai. Knowledge of these trails continues to be held by whānau and hapū and is regarded as a taonga. The traditional mobile lifestyle of the people led to their dependence on the resources of the river.

The mauri of the Rangitata represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the river.

##### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

Pursuant to [section 215][241], and without limiting the rest of this schedule, the only purposes of this statutory acknowledgement are---
    
*   (a) to require that consent authorities forward summaries of resource consent applications to Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu as required by regulations made pursuant to [section 207][233] (clause 12.2.3 of the deed of settlement); and

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to the Taramakau River, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with the Taramakau River

Manawhenua (tribal authority over the area) was gained through Ngāi Tahu's defeat of Ngāti Wairaki, Tūmatakōkiri and Ngāti Toa. For Ngāi Tahu, histories such as this reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

The Taramakau River was and still is a significant indigenous fishery and source of manu (birds). The river remains a source of rich and abundant harvests. The area is noted particularly for its tuna (eel) and inaka (whitebait) fisheries.

The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the river, the relationship of people with the river and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

There was a pā at the mouth of the river, and kainga nohoanga (temporary settlements) were established along the length of the river which were related to the taking of mahinga kai and, in particular, the retrieval of pounamu. The river itself was, therefore, a significant part of the pounamu trail, via which the taonga was transported from its source to be traded up and down the country.

The tūpuna had an intimate knowledge of navigation, river routes, safe harbours and landing places, and the locations of food and other resources on the river. The river was an integral part of a network of trails which were used in order to ensure the safest journey, and incorporated locations along the way that were identified for activities including camping overnight and gathering kai. Knowledge of these trails continues to be held by whānau and hapū and is regarded as a taonga. The traditional mobile lifestyle of the people led to their dependence on the resources of the river.

The mauri of Taramakau represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the river.

## Schedule 57  
Statutory acknowledgement for Takapo (Lake Tekapo)

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the lake known as Takapo (Lake Tekapo), the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 34 (SO 19836).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Takapo, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Takapo

Takapo is one of the lakes referred to in the tradition of ""Ngā Puna Wai Karikari o Rakaihautu"" which tells how the principal lakes of Te Wai Pounamu were dug by the rangatira (chief) Rakaihautu. Rakaihautu was the captain of the canoe, Uruao, which brought the tribe, Waitaha, to New Zealand. Rakaihautu beached his canoe at Whakatū (Nelson). From Whakatū, Rakaihautu divided the new arrivals in two, with his son taking one party to explore the coastline southwards and Rakaihautu taking another southwards by an inland route. On his inland journey southward, Rakaihautu used his famous kō (a tool similar to a spade) to dig the principal lakes of Te Wai Pounamu, including Takapo.

For Ngāi Tahu, traditions such as this represent the links between the cosmological world of the gods and present generations, these histories reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

Takapo was often occupied by Ngāi Tahu and, like most lakes, there are traditions of a taniwha connected with it. Tradition has it that the tohunga Te Maiharoa is the only person to have swum the lake and escaped the taniwha. This story is told to demonstrate that the mana of Te Maiharoa was greater than that of the taniwha of the lake.

As a result of this history of occupation, there are a number of urupā associated with the lake. Urupā are the resting places of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna and, as such, are the focus for whānau traditions. These are places holding the memories, traditions, victories and defeats of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna, and are frequently protected by secret locations.

Takapo served as a mahinga kai for South Canterbury Ngāi Tahu. Waterfowl and eel were the main foods taken from this lake. The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the lake, the relationship of people with the lake and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

The mauri of Takapo represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the lake.

##### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

Pursuant to [section 215][241], and without limiting the rest of this schedule, the only purposes of this statutory acknowledgement are---
    
*   (a) to require that consent authorities forward summaries of resource consent applications to Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu as required by regulations made pursuant to [section 207][233] (clause 12.2.3 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (b) to require that consent authorities, Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga, or the Environment Court, as the case may be, have regard to this statutory acknowledgement in relation to Takapo, as provided in [sections 208 to 210][234] (clause 12.2.4 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (c) to empower the Minister responsible for management of Takapo or the Commissioner of Crown Lands, as the case may be, to enter into a Deed of Recognition as provided in [section 212][238] (clause 12.2.6 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (d) to enable Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu and any member of Ngāi Tahu Whānui to cite this statutory acknowledgement as evidence of the association of Ngāi Tahu to Takapo as provided in [section 211][237] (clause 12.2.5 of the deed of settlement).

##### Limitations on effect of statutory acknowledgement

Except as expressly provided in [sections 208 to 211][234], [213][239], and [215][241],---
    
*   (a) this statutory acknowledgement does not affect, and is not to be taken into account in, the exercise of any power, duty, or function by any person or entity under any statute, regulation, or bylaw; and

*   (b) without limiting paragraph (a), no person or entity, in considering any matter or making any decision or recommendation under any statute, regulation, or bylaw, may give any greater or lesser weight to Ngāi Tahu's association to Takapo (as described in this statutory acknowledgement) than that person or entity would give under the relevant statute, regulation, or bylaw, if this statutory acknowledgement did not exist in respect of Takapo.

## Schedule 58  
Statutory acknowledgement for Te Ana-au (Lake Te Anau)

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the lake known as Te Ana-au (Lake Te Anau), the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 42 (SO 12259).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Te Ana-au, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Te Ana-au

Te Ana-au is one of the lakes referred to in the tradition of ""Ngā Puna Wai Karikari o Rakaihautu"" which tells how the principal lakes of Te Wai Pounamu were dug by the rangatira (chief) Rakaihautu. Rakaihautu was the captain of the canoe, Uruao, which brought the tribe, Waitaha, to New Zealand. Rakaihautu beached his canoe at Whakatū (Nelson). From Whakatū, Rakaihautu divided the new arrivals in two, with his son taking one party to explore the coastline southwards and Rakaihautu taking another southwards by an inland route. On his inland journey southward, Rakaihautu used his famous kō (a tool similar to a spade) to dig the principal lakes of Te Wai Pounamu, including Te Ana-au.

For Ngāi Tahu, traditions such as this represent the links between the cosmological world of the gods and present generations, these histories reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

Te Ana-au figures in Ngāi Tahu histories as one of the last places where Ngāi Tahu and Ngāti Mamoe came into conflict after the peace established between Rakiihia and Te Hautapunui o Tū. After Rakiihia had died, his bones were stripped of flesh and were buried in a cave on a cliff facing the seaside near Dunedin. However, a landslip led to the bones being uncovered. The bones were found by Ngāi Tahu fishermen and made into fish hooks, an act designed to insult. Among Māori it was a practice to take the bones of enemy leaders who had recently died, fashion them into fish hooks and present fish caught with them to the enemy as a gift. Once the fish had been eaten, the enemy would be told they had feasted on fish that had in turn feasted on their dead.

While Ngāi Tahu were fishing with their Ngāti Mamoe relations, one of the Ngāi Tahu fisherman referred to the fish biting the bones of Rakiihia. The Ngāti Mamoe fisherman recognised the insult and checked the cave in which their leader had been interred. Finding that the grave had been desecrated, the Ngāti Mamoe found and killed the son of a senior Ngāi Tahu rangatira (chief). Before Ngāi Tahu could retaliate, the Ngāti Mamoe were warned that they should leave the coast for the inland lakes where they would not be found. Ngāti Mamoe headed to Te Ana-au. Among this Ngāti Mamoe party was Rakiihia's brother, Pukutahi. Pukutahi fell sick along Te Ana-au's shoreline and rested while his followers explored the lake to find a safer place.

Approaching the lakes, Te Hau, the leader of the Ngāi Tahu party, observed that the fugitives had divided in two, and unfortunately for Pukutahi, decided to follow the trail up to Te Ana-au. The Ngāti Mamoe camp was found and in the morning the chiefs of Ngāti Mamoe, including Pukutahi, were killed. This was to be one of the last battles between the tribes.

The lake was an important mahinga kai in the interior. The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of Te Ana-au, the relationship of people with the lake and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

The mauri of Te Ana-au represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the lake.

##### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

## Schedule 59  
Statutory acknowledgement for Te Ao Mārama (Lake Benmore)

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the lake known as Te Ao Mārama (Lake Benmore), the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 130 (SO 19857 (Canterbury Land District) and SO 24748 (Otago Land District)).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Te Ao Mārama, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Te Ao Mārama

While the man-made Te Ao Mārama is obviously a comparatively recent creation on the landscape, it overlays the path of the Waitaki River, which is very significant to Ngāi Tahu as the pathway of the waters from Aoraki to the sea. Ngāi Tahu Whānui always recognise and pay respects to Waitaki as a significant element of their being, and identity, a creation of the atua (gods), further moulded by Tū Te Rakiwhānoa and his assistants, one of whom was Marokura who stocked the waterways.

In addition, the lake now covers areas which have been very important in Ngāi Tahu history. The Ahuriri arm of the lake was the site of Te Ao Mārama, the nohoanga that Te Maiharoa was evicted from by the constabulary in the late 1800s. It is in memory of this that the lake is now referred to by the same name. A number of other nohoanga existed in the area the lake now covers, and these were among the 170 which one record lists as existing in the Waitaki basin. One of these was at Sailors Cutting, and was known as Te Whakapiri a Te Kaiokai.

Many wāhi tapu and wāhi taonga were also drowned by Te Ao Mārama, including a number of rock art sites, while others still survive. Urupā associated with the nohoanga in the area also lie under the lake. These are the resting places of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna and, as such, are the focus for whānau traditions. These are places holding the memories, traditions, victories and defeats of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna, and are frequently protected by secret locations.

An important and productive fishery exists in the lake, with the Haldane and Ahuriri arms once rich in long-finned eels, although in more recent times the fishery has been depleted. Freshwater mussels (waikākahi) are also available in the Ahuriri shallows. Excellent stands of raupō grow on the edge of the lake, adjacent to the deep water. This hardy plant, which was traditionally used for kai and in the making of mōkihi (a type of waka, or canoe, used on inland waterways) is not affected by the heavy frosts of the area or cattle grazing. The Ahuriri arm was also an important waterfowl and weka habitat.

Strategic marriages between hapū strengthened the kupenga (net) of whakapapa and thus rights to use the resources of the area. These whakapapa rights and relationships still apply to the lake itself.

The area which the lake now covers was once a major route from coast to coast: to Hawea and Wanaka via the Lindis Pass, and to the West Coast via Ōkuru or Haast Pass. There was also a trail via the Lindis through into the Central Otago summer resorts, mahinga kai and pounamu resources. Trails linked to seasonal resource gathering lead into the Ōhau, Pūkaki and Takapo, Alexandrina and Whakarukumoana catchments. These were used in order to ensure the safest journey and incorporated locations along the way that were identified for activities including camping overnight and gathering kai. Knowledge of these trails continues to be held by whānau and hapū and is regarded as a taonga. The traditional mobile lifestyle of the people led to their dependence on the resources of the land and waterways.

Wai-para-hoanga meaning literally ""water of grinding stone dirt"" is a descriptive name for the water that once flowed unhindered in the Waitaki, sourced from Pūkaki, Takapo and Ōhau, and ultimately from Aoraki itself.

Notwithstanding more recent man-made changes to the landscape and waterways, the mauri of Te Ao Mārama represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the lake.

##### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

Pursuant to [section 215][241], and without limiting the rest of this schedule, the only purposes of this statutory acknowledgement are---
    
*   (a) to require that consent authorities forward summaries of resource consent applications to Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu as required by regulations made pursuant to [section 207][233] (clause 12.2.3 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (c) to empower the Minister responsible for management of Te Ao Mārama or the Commissioner of Crown Lands, as the case may be, to enter into a Deed of Recognition as provided in [section 212][238] (clause 12.2.6 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (d) to enable Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu and any member of Ngāi Tahu Whānui to cite this statutory acknowledgement as evidence of the association of Ngāi Tahu to Te Ao Mārama as provided in [section 211][237] (clause 12.2.5 of the deed of settlement).

## Schedule 60  
Statutory acknowledgement for Te Tauraka Poti (Merton Tidal Arm)

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the wetland known as Te Tauraka Poti (Merton Tidal Arm), the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 56 (SO 24722).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Te Tauraka Poti, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Te Tauraka Poti

Te Tauraka Poti, fed by the streams known as Kirikiri Whakahoro and Kokonui, was a major mahinga kai for kāinga and pā located on the coast north of the Otago Peninsula. The wetlands were a rich source of kai, including tuna (eels), mōhoao (black flounder), giant kōkopu and water fowl. The wetlands were particularly valued as a spawning ground for inaka (whitebait).

The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of Te Tauraka Poti, the relationship of people with the wetland and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

As a result of this history of use, there are a number of wāhi taonga within the wetland area, including middens and other evidence of occupation. These are important as places holding the memories of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna.

Te Tauraka Poti formed an integral part of a network of trails which were used in order to ensure the safest journey and incorporated locations along the way that were identified for activities including camping overnight and gathering kai. Knowledge of these trails continues to be held by whānau and hapū and is regarded as a taonga. The traditional mobile lifestyle of the people led to their dependence on the resources of the wetland.

Much of Te Tauraka Poti's continuing significance to Ngāi Tahu lies in the fact that it is the only remaining wetland area of any significance in the vicinity. The mauri of Te Tauraka Poti represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the wetland.

##### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

## Schedule 61  
Statutory acknowledgement for Te Wairere (Lake Dunstan)

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the lake known as Te Wairere (Lake Dunstan), the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 490 (SO 24729).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Te Wairere, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Te Wairere

The name ""Te Wairere"" refers to the speed with which the river once ran at this point.

The whole of the Mata-au (Clutha River), on which Te Wairere lies, was part of a mahinga kai trail that led inland and was used by Otago hapū including Kāti Kurī, Ngāti Ruahikihiki, Ngāti Huirapa and Ngāi Tuahuriri. The river was used as a highway into the interior, and provided many resources to sustain travellers on that journey. The river was a significant indigenous fishery, providing tuna (eels), kanakana (lamprey) and kōkopu in the area over which Te Wairere now lies. Manu (birds), including moa, were taken from areas adjoining the river, over which the lake now lies.

The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka (landing places), places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the river, the relationship of people with the river and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

The waterway was also very important in the transportation of pounamu from inland areas down to settlements on the coast, from where it was traded north and south. Because of its location at the confluence of Mata-au and Kawarau Rivers, Te Wairere was an important staging post on journeys inland and down-river. A tauranga waka and nohoanga sited at the junction of the two rivers acted as such a staging post. As a result of this history of use and occupation there are a number of wāhi taonga (including rock shelters and archaeological sites) in the area, some of which are now under the waters of the lake. Wāhi tapu are important as places holding the memories and traditions of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna.

The tūpuna had an intimate knowledge of navigation, river routes, safe harbours and landing places, and the locations of food and other resources on the river. The waterway was an integral part of a network of trails which were used in order to ensure the safest journey and incorporated locations along the way that were identified for activities including camping overnight and gathering kai. Knowledge of these trails continues to be held by whānau and hapū and is regarded as a taonga. The traditional mobile lifestyle of the people led to their dependence on the resources of the waterway.

The mauri of Te Wairere represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the lake.

## Schedule 62  
Statutory acknowledgement for Tititea (Mount Aspiring)

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the mountain known as Tititea (Mount Aspiring), located in the Mount Aspiring National Park, as shown on Allocation Plan MS 2 (SO 24665).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Tititea as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Tititea

As with all principal maunga (mountains), Tititea is imbued with the spiritual elements of Raki and Papa, in tradition and practice regarded as an important link to the primeval parents. Tititea is a prominent and majestic peak, clearly visible from a number of vantage points in the south, and its role in Ngāi Tahu's creation stories gives rise to its tapu status. From the heights above Te Ana-au (Lake Te Anau), it is a particularly impressive sight when the sun is setting.

The most common Ngāi Tahu name for the mountain known to Pākehā as Mount Aspiring is Tititea, referring to the mountain's white peak. It is not unusual, however, for places and physical features to have more than one name, reflecting the traditions of the successive iwi who peopled the land. Other names for the mountain include ""Mākahi Tā Rakiwhānoa"" (referring to a wedge belonging to Tū Te Rakiwhānoa) and ""Ōtapahu"", which may refer to a type of dogskin cloak.

The Bonar Glacier is known as Hukairoroa Tā Parekiore (which refers to the long, hard glacial ice and crevasses formed by Parekiore). Parekiore was a giant who used to stalk up and down the South and North Islands taking tītī (muttonbirds) northwards and returning with kūmara. The lakes represent his footprints and the frozen splashes from his footsteps in the south were transformed into glaciers.

For Ngāi Tahu, traditions such as this represent the links between the cosmological world of the gods and present generations, these histories reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

The area was part of a network of trails which were used in order to ensure the safest journey and incorporated locations along the way that were identified for activities including camping overnight and gathering kai. Knowledge of these trails continues to be held by whānau and hapū and is regarded as a taonga. The traditional mobile lifestyle of the people led to their dependence on the resources of the land.

The mauri of Tititea represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the area.

##### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

Pursuant to [section 215][241], and without limiting the rest of this schedule, the only purposes of this statutory acknowledgement are---
    
*   (a) to require that consent authorities forward summaries of resource consent applications to Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu as required by regulations made pursuant to [section 207][233] (clause 12.2.3 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (b) to require that consent authorities, Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga, or the Environment Court, as the case may be, have regard to this statutory acknowledgement in relation to Tititea, as provided in [sections 208 to 210][234] (clause 12.2.4 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (c) to empower the Minister responsible for management of Tititea or the Commissioner of Crown Lands, as the case may be, to enter into a Deed of Recognition as provided in [section 212][238] (clause 12.2.6 of the deed of settlement); and

## Schedule 63  
Statutory acknowledgement for Toi Toi Wetland, Rakiura

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the wetland known as Toi Toi, the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 135 (SO 12266).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Toi Toi, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Toi Toi

Toi Toi wetland is particularly significant to Ngāi Tahu as a kākāpō habitat. The kākāpō, once a prized mahinga kai for Ngāi Tahu, used the wetland as a feeding ground.

The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of Toi Toi, the relationship of people with the wetland and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

Much of Toi Toi's value lies in its pristine and unmodified character. The mauri of Toi Toi represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the wetland.

##### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

*   (b) to require that consent authorities, Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga, or the Environment Court, as the case may be, have regard to this statutory acknowledgement in relation to Toi Toi as provided in [sections 208 to 210][234] (clause 12.2.4 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (c) to empower the Minister responsible for management of Toi Toi or the Commissioner of Crown Lands, as the case may be, to enter into a Deed of Recognition as provided in [section 212][238] (clause 12.2.6 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (d) to enable Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu and any member of Ngāi Tahu Whānui to cite this statutory acknowledgement as evidence of the association of Ngāi Tahu to Toi Toi as provided in [section 211][237] (clause 12.2.5 of the deed of settlement).

##### Limitations on effect of statutory acknowledgement

Except as expressly provided in [sections 208 to 211][234], [213][239], and [215][241],---

## Schedule 64  
Statutory acknowledgement for Tokatā (The Nuggets)

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the area known as Tokatā (The Nuggets), as shown on Allocation Plan MS 10 (SO 24699).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Tokatā as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Tokatā

The creation and shaping of Tokatā and the surrounding coastline relates in time to Te Waka o Aoraki, and the subsequent efforts of Tū Te Rakiwhānoa. The name Tokatā is a reference to the Nuggets, however, the individual nuggets also carry their own names: Te Ana Puta has a cave in it, Pae Kōau is frequented by shags, three small nuggets on the north side are known collectively as Makunui and support a large seal colony, while the nugget furthest out to sea is Porokaea. The hill on which the lighthouse stands is known to Ngāi Tahu as Taumata o Te Rakipokia, and a cave on the north side of this hill is Te Ana o Kātiwairua. For Ngāi Tahu, such traditional names and their associated histories reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events that have shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

The great explorer Rakaihautu passed by this area of the Otago coast on his journey northward, and the area was subsequently visited and occupied by Waitaha, Ngāti Mamoe and Ngāi Tahu in succession, who through conflict and alliance, have merged in the whakapapa (genealogy) of Ngāi Tahu Whānui. This area of the Otago coast has many reminders of the uneasy relationships that once existed between Ngāti Mamoe and Ngāi Tahu. Skirmishes between the two iwi occurred intermittently just to the north. However, one battle occurred within the area referred to as Tokatā after which some of the fallen were cooked. As a result of this activity, this area is now a wāhi tapu. Such wāhi tapu are the resting places of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna (ancestors) and, as such, are the focus for whānau traditions. These are places holding the memories, traditions, victories and defeats of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna, and are frequently protected by secret locations.

Tokatā is a significant physical marker on the South Otago coast, with waka (canoes) voyaging south and north, or out to sea on fishing expeditions utilising it as a bearing marker. It also acted as a pointer to the safe tauranga waka (landing place) in Kaimātaitai Bay, just to the north. The tūpuna had an intimate knowledge of navigation, sea routes, safe harbours and landing places, and the locations of food and other resources on the coast. Tokatā therefore formed an integral part of a network of trails which were used in order to ensure the safest journey and incorporated locations along the way that were identified for activities including camping overnight and gathering kai. Knowledge of these trails continues to be held by whānau and hapū and is regarded as a taonga. The traditional mobile lifestyle of the people led to their dependence on the resources of the land and sea. Tokatā also marks the south-eastern boundary of the Ōtākou Sale Deed area, marked out in 1844\.

A variety of mahinga kai (principally kaimoana---seafood) is available at Tokatā. The extensive rocky intertidal zone provides paua, kutai (mussels) and kōura (crayfish) in abundance. The fur seal, leopard seal and sea lion all rest here, with their pups forming a ready source of kai in days gone by. Gull eggs, kōau (shags) and tītī (muttonbirds) were also harvested in the area. An excellent rimurapa (kelp) resource was utilised for making poha (storage bags), capable of preserving the tītī for up to two years. Excellent fishing grounds seaward of Tokatā supplied the resources of the coast.

The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the land and sea, the relationship of people with the coastline and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

The mauri of Tokatā represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the area.

##### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

Pursuant to [section 215][241], and without limiting the rest of this schedule, the only purposes of this statutory acknowledgement are---
    
*   (a) to require that consent authorities forward summaries of resource consent applications to Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu as required by regulations made pursuant to [section 207][233] (clause 12.2.3 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (b) to require that consent authorities, Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga, or the Environment Court, as the case may be, have regard to this statutory acknowledgement in relation to Tokatā, as provided in [sections 208 to 210][234] (clause 12.2.4 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (c) to empower the Minister responsible for management of Tokatā or the Commissioner of Crown Lands, as the case may be, to enter into a Deed of Recognition as provided in [section 212][238] (clause 12.2.6 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (d) to enable Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu and any member of Ngāi Tahu Whānui to cite this statutory acknowledgement as evidence of the association of Ngāi Tahu to Tokatā as provided in [section 211][237] (clause 12.2.5 of the deed of settlement).

##### Limitations on effect of statutory acknowledgement

Except as expressly provided in [sections 208 to 211][234], [213][239], and [215][241],---
    
*   (a) this statutory acknowledgement does not affect, and is not to be taken into account in, the exercise of any power, duty, or function by any person or entity under any statute, regulation, or bylaw; and

*   (b) without limiting paragraph (a), no person or entity, in considering any matter or making any decision or recommendation under any statute, regulation, or bylaw, may give any greater or lesser weight to Ngāi Tahu's association to Tokatā (as described in this statutory acknowledgement) than that person or entity would give under the relevant statute, regulation, or bylaw, if this statutory acknowledgement did not exist in respect of Tokatā.

Except as expressly provided in this Act, this statutory acknowledgement does not affect the lawful rights or interests of any person who is not a party to the deed of settlement.

Except as expressly provided in this Act, this statutory acknowledgement does not, of itself, have the effect of granting, creating, or providing evidence of any estate or interest in, or any rights of any kind whatsoever relating to, Tokatā.

## Schedule 65  
Statutory acknowledgement for Tūtae Putaputa (Conway River)

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the area known as Tūtae Putaputa (Conway River), the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 109 (SO 7328 (Marlborough Land District) and SO 19906 (Canterbury Land District)).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to the Tūtae Putaputa, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with the Tūtae Putaputa

This river, and the mahinga kai which it provided, fell under the mana of the Ngāti Wairaki chief Rakatuarua until Ngāi Tahu gained manawhenua (tribal authority over the area) by way of the Ngāti Kurī hapū.

The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the river, the relationship of people with the river and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

The resources of the river once supported a nearby pā built by the Ngāti Mamoe leader, Tukiauau. Tukiauau eventually abandoned this pā for another site just south of Dunedin.

There are numerous urupā and wāhi tapu associated with the river, particularly in the vicinity of the pā, Pariwhakatau. Urupā are the resting places of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna and, as such, are the focus for whānau traditions. Urupā and wāhi tapu are places holding the memories, traditions, victories and defeats of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna, and are frequently protected by secret locations.

The mauri of Tūtae Putaputa represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the river.

## Schedule 66  
Statutory acknowledgement for Tūtoko

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the mountain known as Tūtoko, as shown on Allocation Plan MS 3 (SO 24747 (Otago Land District) and SO 12231 (Southland Land District)).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Tūtoko as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Tūtoko

The Fiordland area, within which Tūtoko stands, represents, in tradition, the raised-up sides of Te Waka o Aoraki, after it foundered on a submerged reef and its occupants, Aoraki and his brothers, were turned to stone. These people are now manifested in the highest peaks in Kā Tiritiri o Te Moana (the Southern Alps). The fiords at the southern end of the Alps were carved out of the raised side of the wrecked Waka o Aoraki by Tū Te Rakiwhānoa, so as to make the waka (canoe) habitable by humans. The deep gorges and long waterways that are the fiords were provided as safe havens on this rugged coast, and stocked with fish, forest and birds to sustain humans.

For Ngāi Tahu, traditions such as this represent the links between the cosmological world of the gods and present generations, these histories reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events that have shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

Tūtoko is not, in fact, the original name of the maunga (mountain), but was applied by Dr J. Hector in 1863 after he met the old rangatira (chief) Tūtoko and his two daughters, Sara and May. The hills to the north of the Kōtuku River are named the Sara Hills, and those to the south May Hills, after these daughters. The use of this name is seen as appropriate to Ngāi Tahu, as Tūtoko was an important rangatira of this region at that time, and is represented by the mountain.

Tūtoko is the kaitiaki (guardian) of Whakatipuwaitai, the westernmost creation of Rakaihautu and the southernmost kāinga (settlement) of Te Tai Poutini (West Coast) pounamu trails, which provides access to koko-takiwai (a type of pounamu) at Piopiotahi (Milford Sound) and Poison Bay further to the south. The kāinga was also an important staging post for travel into the Lake Wakatipu area via the Hollyford Valley. All of these trails, whether by land or by sea, lie under the shadow of Tūtoko.

The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the land, the relationship of people with the land and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

Mountains such as Tūtoko are linked in whakapapa to the gods, and being the closest earthly elements to Raki the sky father, they are likened to the children of Raki and Papa, reaching skyward. The mauri of Tūtoko represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the land.

##### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

Pursuant to [section 215][241], and without limiting the rest of this schedule, the only purposes of this statutory acknowledgement are---
    
*   (a) to require that consent authorities forward summaries of resource consent applications to Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu as required by regulations made pursuant to [section 207][233] (clause 12.2.3 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (c) to empower the Minister responsible for management of Tūtoko or the Commissioner of Crown Lands, as the case may be, to enter into a Deed of Recognition as provided in [section 212][238] (clause 12.2.6 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (d) to enable Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu and any member of Ngāi Tahu Whānui to cite this statutory acknowledgement as evidence of the association of Ngāi Tahu to Tūtoko as provided in [section 211][237] (clause 12.2.5 of the deed of settlement).

## Schedule 67  
Statutory acknowledgement for Uerau (Mount Uwerau)

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the area known as Uerau (Mount Uwerau), as shown on Allocation Plan MS 101 (SO 7318).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Uerau, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Uerau

The name Uwerau should properly be spelt Uerau, which is the name of an important Ngāi Tahu tupuna (ancestor) with Ngāti Mamoe descent lines. In particular, those descent lines lead down to Tura, a principal tupuna for Ngāti Mamoe, Ngāti Wairaki and Rapuwai - all of which are constituents of the iwi known today as Ngāi Tahu. For Ngāi Tahu, such placing of tūpuna names on significant landscape features serves as a reminder of tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and documents events that have shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

As with all principal maunga (mountains), Uerau is imbued with the spiritual elements of Raki and Papa, in tradition and practice regarded as an important link to the primeval parents. Like the rest of the mountains in this region, Uerau is closely connected with the Arai Te Uru tradition, which tells that many of the mountains of the Southern Alps and Kaikōura Ranges are the manifestations of the survivors of the Arai Te Uru waka (canoe) which foundered at Moeraki, on the north Otago coast.

This area was used by Ngāi Tahu as a mahinga kai (food gathering place) where birds, particularly tītī (muttonbirds) were harvested. The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of such places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the land, the relationship of people with the land and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

There are a number of urupā (burial places) in this area unique to the descendants of Tura. Urupā are the resting places of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna and, as such, are the focus for whānau traditions. These are places holding the memories, traditions, victories and defeats of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna, and are frequently protected by secret locations.

The Kāti Kurī hapū of Ngāi Tahu has manawhenua (tribal authority over land) and carries the responsibilities of kaitiaki in relation to the area. The hapū is represented by the tribal structure, Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu.

The mauri of Uerau represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the land.

##### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

Pursuant to [section 215][241], and without limiting the rest of this schedule, the only purposes of this statutory acknowledgement are---
    
*   (a) to require that consent authorities forward summaries of resource consent applications to Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu as required by regulations made pursuant to [section 207][233] (clause 12.2.3 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (b) to require that consent authorities, Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga, or the Environment Court, as the case may be, have regard to this statutory acknowledgement in relation to Uerau, as provided in [sections 208 to 210][234] (clause 12.2.4 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (c) to empower the Minister responsible for management of Uerau or the Commissioner of Crown Lands, as the case may be, to enter into a Deed of Recognition as provided in [section 212][238] (clause 12.2.6 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (d) to enable Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu and any member of Ngāi Tahu Whānui to cite this statutory acknowledgement as evidence of the association of Ngāi Tahu to Uerau as provided in [section 211][237] (clause 12.2.5 of the deed of settlement).

##### Limitations on effect of statutory acknowledgement

Except as expressly provided in [sections 208 to 211][234], [213][239], and [215][241],---
    
*   (a) this statutory acknowledgement does not affect, and is not to be taken into account in, the exercise of any power, duty, or function by any person or entity under any statute, regulation, or bylaw; and

*   (b) without limiting paragraph (a), no person or entity, in considering any matter or making any decision or recommendation under any statute, regulation, or bylaw, may give any greater or lesser weight to Ngāi Tahu's association to Uerau (as described in this statutory acknowledgement) than that person or entity would give under the relevant statute, regulation, or bylaw, if this statutory acknowledgement did not exist in respect of Uerau.

Except as expressly provided in this Act, this statutory acknowledgement does not affect the lawful rights or interests of any person who is not a party to the deed of settlement.

Except as expressly provided in this Act, this statutory acknowledgement does not, of itself, have the effect of granting, creating, or providing evidence of any estate or interest in, or any rights of any kind whatsoever relating to, Uerau.

## Schedule 68  
Statutory acknowledgement for Uruwera (Lake George)

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the wetland known as Uruwera (Lake George), the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 59 (SO 12261).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Uruwera, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Uruwera

Lake George is known to Ngāi Tahu as Uruwera, named after a descendant of the Waitaha rangatira (chief), Rakaihautu. Uruwera's descent lines lead to Te Ropuake, the wife of Mako, a leading chief of Ngāti Irakehu of Banks Peninsula. Te Ropuake's mother was Hine Te Awheka, wife of Te Rakiwhakaputa, another leading Ngāi Tahu chief who eventually occupied Rapaki on Banks Peninsula. Both Mako and Te Rakiwhakaputa migrated to Canterbury with the Ngāi Tahu hapū, Ngāi Tuhaitara. Examples such as this demonstrate the interconnected nature of Ngāi Tahu whakapapa.

For Ngāi Tahu, histories such as this reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

Foods taken from this mahinga kai included tuna (eels), inaka (whitebait) and water fowl. Uruwera has been in continual use by Ngāi Tahu as a mahinga kai for many generations. The lake is a particularly important resource for Ngāi Tahu from Ōraka, Awarua and Ruapuke.

The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of Uruwera, the relationship of people with the lake and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

As a result of this history of use, there are a number of urupā associated with Uruwera. Urupā are the resting places of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna and, as such, are the focus for whānau traditions. These are places holding the memories, traditions, victories and defeats of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna, and are frequently protected by secret locations.

The mauri of Uruwera represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the lake.

*   (a) to require that consent authorities forward summaries of resource consent applications to Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu as required by regulations made pursuant to [section 207][233] (clause 12.2.3 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (b) to require that consent authorities, Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga, or the Environment Court, as the case may be, have regard to this statutory acknowledgement in relation to Uruwera, as provided in [sections 208 to 210][234] (clause 12.2.4 of the deed of settlement); and

Except as expressly provided in this Act, this statutory acknowledgement does not affect the lawful rights or interests of any person who is not a party to the deed of settlement.

Except as expressly provided in this Act, this statutory acknowledgement does not, of itself, have the effect of granting, creating, or providing evidence of any estate or interest in, or any rights of any kind whatsoever relating to, Uruwera.

## Schedule 69  
Statutory acknowledgement for Waiau River

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the river known as Waiau, the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 124 (SO 12263).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to the Waiau, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with the Waiau

The Waiau River features in the earliest of traditional accounts, and was a place and resource well known to the earliest tūpuna (ancestors) to visit the area. Rakaihautu and his followers traced the Waiau from its source in Te Ana-au (Lake Te Anau) and Motu-ua or Moturau (Lake Manapōuri), to its meeting with the sea at Te Wae Wae Bay.

The waka Takitimu, under the command of the rangatira (chief) Tamatea, was wrecked near the mouth of the Waiau River and the survivors who landed at the mouth named the river ""Waiau"" due to the swirling nature of its waters. Tamatea and his party made their way up the river to Lake Manapōuri where they established a camp site. The journey of Tamatea was bedevilled by the disappearance of Kaheraki who was betrothed to Kahungunu, a son of Tamatea. Kaheraki strayed away from the party, and was captured by the Maeroero (spirits of the mountain).

For Ngāi Tahu, traditions such as this represent the links between the cosmological world of the gods and present generations, these histories reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

The Waiau has strong links with Waitaha who, following their arrival in the waka Uruao, populated and spread their influence over vast tracts of the South Island. They were the moa hunters, the original artisans of the land. There are remnants of Waitaha rock art associated with the river. Surviving rock art remnants are a particular taonga of the area, providing a unique record of the lives and beliefs of the people who travelled the river.

There is also a strong Ngāti Mamoe influence in this area of the country. Ngāti Mamoe absorbed and intermarried with the Waitaha and settled along the eastern coast of Te Wai Pounamu. The arrival of Ngāi Tahu in Te Wai Pounamu caused Ngāti Mamoe to become concentrated in the southern part of the island, with intermarriage between the two iwi occurring later than was the case further north. The result is that there is a greater degree of Ngāti Mamoe influence retained in this area than in other parts of the island. These are the three iwi who, through conflict and alliance, have merged in the whakapapa (genealogy) of Ngāi Tahu Whānui.

Numerous archaeological sites and wāhi taonga attest to the history of occupation and use of the river. These are places holding the memories, traditions, victories and defeats of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna. The main nohoanga (occupation site) on the Waiau was at the mouth and was called Te Tua a Hatu. The rangatira (chief) Te Wae Wae had his kāinga nohoanga on the left bank of the Waiau River mouth.

The Waiau, which once had the second largest flow of any river in New Zealand, had a huge influence on the lives and seasonal patterns of the people of Murihiku, over many generations. The river was a major mahinga kai: aruhe (fernroot), tī root, fish, tuna (eels), shellfish and tutu were gathered in the summer, a range of fish were caught in the autumn, kanakana (lamprey) were caught in the spring, while the people were largely reliant during winter on foods gathered and preserved earlier in the year. Rauri (reserves) were applied to the mahinga kai resources, so that people from one hapū or whānau never gathered kai from areas of another hapū or whānau. Some 200 species of plants and animals were utilised by Ngāi Tahu as a food resource in and near the Waiau.

The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the Waiau, the relationship of people with the river and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

Place names provide many indicators of the values associated with different areas, including Waiharakeke (flax), Papatōtara (tōtara logs or bark), Kirirua (a type of eel found in the lagoon), Te Rua o te Kaiamio (a rock shelter that was a ""designated meeting place"" for the local Māori, similar to a marae) and Kā Kerehu o Tamatea -- (""charcoal from the fire of Tamatea"" -- black rocks near old Tuatapere ferry site).

The Waiau River was a major travelling route connecting Murihiku and Te Ara a Kiwa (Foveaux Strait) to Te Tai Poutini (the West Coast) and, as such, was a important link between hapū and iwi. Pounamu on the West Coast, and summer expeditions to Manapōuri (Motu-ua or Moturau) for mahinga kai were the main motivations for movement up and down the Waiau. Mōkihi (vessels made from raupō) were utilised for travel down the river and were a very effective and common mode of travel, making transportation of substantial loads of resources possible.

The tūpuna had an intimate knowledge of navigation, river routes, safe harbours and landing places, and the locations of food and other resources on the Waiau. The river was an integral part of a network of trails which were used in order to ensure the safest journey and incorporated locations along the way that were identified for activities including camping overnight and gathering kai. Knowledge of these trails continues to be held by whānau and hapū and is regarded as a taonga. The traditional mobile lifestyle of the people led to their dependence on the resources of the river.

The Waiau was once a large and powerful river, up to 500m across at the mouth, narrowing to 200m further upstream. The water flow from the Waiau River was an important factor in the ecological health and bio-diversity of the coastal resources.

The mauri of the Waiau represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the river.

##### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

Pursuant to [section 215][241], and without limiting the rest of this schedule, the only purposes of this statutory acknowledgement are---

## Schedule 70  
Statutory acknowledgement for Waihola/Waipori Wetland

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the wetland known as Waihola/Waipori, the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 55 (SO 24721).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Waihola/Waipori, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Waihola/Waipori

The Waihola/Waipori wetlands were once one of the most significant food baskets in the Otago region, and featured in the seasonal activity of the coastal settlements as far away as the Otago Peninsula and harbour area, Pūrākaunui and Puketeraki. The wetlands were once much larger in water area and deeper than at present, connected by a labyrinth of waterways and having a gravel bed which has now been overlaid by silt and mud.

The names Waihola/Waipori are likely of Waitaha derivation, with ""hola"" being the Waitaha form of ""hora"" meaning flat, spread out or widespread. Waipori may in fact be a misrecording of Waipōuri, which is used in many older manuscripts, being a reference to the dark, tanin-stained water the wetland receives from Waipori River, a heavily wooded catchment.

The Waihola/Waipori area was visited and occupied by Waitaha, Ngāti Mamoe and Ngāi Tahu in succession, who through conflict and alliance, have merged in the whakapapa (genealogy) of Ngāi Tahu Whānui. The wetland supported a number of pā within its environs and nearby. For example, Whakaraupuka, the pā of the Ngāti Mamoe chief Tukiauau was located in the area now known as Sinclair Wetlands, although Tukiauau eventually relocated further to the south as the southward movement of his Ngāi Tahu foes became uncomfortably close.

There were also many nohoanga (temporary campsites) located within the complex, used by food gathering parties which would travel to the lakes and camp on the fringes for two to three days to gather kai; to eel, hunt water fowl and gather flax. There were also permanent or semi-permanent settlements located in a number of locations around the lakes, some on islands in the wetlands system.

A number of other settlements further afield were also dependent on the mahinga kai resources of Waihola/Waipori for sustenance, including Tū Paritaniwha Pā near Mōmona, Ōmoua Pā above Henley, Maitapapa (Henley area), the kaik south of Henley and Takaaihitau near the old Taieri Ferry bridge, in addition to other settlements adjacent to the Taieri River up and downstream of the wetlands. Ōtākou and Puketeraki hapū would also make seasonal visits to gather resources and strengthen and maintain the kupenga (net) of whakapapa on which their rights to use those resources were based.

There is an account which tells of a sudden flood which required people trapped on the bank at a place called Whakaraupō, on the network of waterways that link Waihola with Waipori, to hastily construct a mōkihi out of raupō to reach safety. A meeting place was opened here in 1901 by the locals. The house was named Te Waipounamu.

For Ngāi Tahu, histories such as these reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

Waihola/Waipori was a key mahinga kai resource for Ngāi Tahu based along the Otago coastal region, where an abundance of tuna (eel), inaka (whitebait), pātiki (flounder) and other indigenous fish were available. Waterfowl and fibre resources such as harakeke and raupō were also easily accessible from the wetlands. Spearing, setting hīnaki and nets, and bobbing for eel were regular activities on the wetlands in the season. The gathering of young ducks in the moult, and the catching of herons, pūkeko and other birds supplemented the broad range of kai available from the wetlands.

The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of Waihola/Waipori, the relationship of people with the lake and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

The attractiveness of Waihola/Waipori as a mahinga kai was enhanced by their accessibility. With the direct link to the Taieri River, access via the Taieri to villages on the banks of the Taieri River, upstream and down, and access by waka to the coast and northward to Ōtākou, kai and other resources gathered from the wetlands could be transported back to these home bases with relative ease.

The tūpuna had an intimate knowledge of navigation, river routes, safe harbours and landing places, and the locations of food and other resources on the wetlands. Knowledge of these trails continues to be held by whānau and hapū and is regarded as a taonga. The traditional mobile lifestyle of the people led to their dependence on the resources of the wetlands.

Because of the long history of use of Waihola/Waipori as a mahinga kai, supporting permanent and temporary settlements, there are numerous urupā, wāhi tapu and wāhi taonga associated with the wetlands. These are all places holding the memories, traditions, victories and defeats of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna, and are frequently protected by secret locations. Urupā are the resting places of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna and, as such, are a particular focus for whānau traditions.

The mauri of Waihola/Waipori represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the wetlands. The wetlands represent, in their resources and characteristics, a strong element of identity for those who had manawhenua (tribal authority over the area) whose tūpuna were nurtured on the food and resources of the wetlands for generations.

## Schedule 71  
Statutory acknowledgement for Wairewa (Lake Forsyth)

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the lake known as Wairewa (Lake Forsyth), the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 45 (SO 19839).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Wairewa, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Wairewa

Wairewa is one of the lakes referred to in the tradition of ""Ngā Puna Wai Karikari o Rakaihautu"" which tells how the principal lakes of Te Wai Pounamu were dug by the rangatira (chief) Rakaihautu. Rakaihautu was the captain of the canoe, Uruao, which brought the tribe, Waitaha, to New Zealand. Rakaihautu beached his canoe at Whakatū (Nelson). From Whakatū, Rakaihautu divided the new arrivals in two, with his son taking one party to explore the coastline southwards and Rakaihautu taking another southwards by an inland route. On his inland journey southward, Rakaihautu used his famous kō (a tool similar to a spade) to dig the principal lakes of Te Wai Pounamu, including Wairewa.

There are place names connected with Wairewa which evoke earlier histories. One example is the mountain which Wairewa lies in the lee of, ""Te Upoko o Tahu Mataa"". This name refers to the Ngāi Tahu ancestor Tahu Mataa who lived and fought in Hawkes Bay. Like many other lakes, Wairewa was occupied by a taniwha called Tū Te Rakiwhānoa, whose origins stem back to the creation traditions.

For Ngāi Tahu, traditions such as this represent the links between the cosmological world of the gods and present generations, these histories reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

The local hapū of this region is Ngāti Irakehu. Irakehu was the descendant of Mako, the Ngāi Tuhaitara chief who took Banks Peninsula with his cohort, Moki. Tradition has it that both Moki and Mako are buried near Wairewa. Poutaiki and Ōtūngākau are two principal urupā associated with Wairewa. Urupā are the resting places of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna and, as such, are the focus for whānau traditions. These are places holding the memories, traditions, victories and defeats of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna, and are frequently protected by secret locations.

Wairewa has been used by the descendants of Rakaihautu ever since it was formed. It is famous for the tuna (eels) that it holds and which migrate out to the sea in the autumn months. Ngāi Tahu gather here annually to take the tuna.

The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the lake, the relationship of people with the lake and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

The mauri of Wairewa represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the lake.

## Schedule 72  
Statutory acknowledgement for Waitaki River

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the river known as Waitaki the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 118 (SO 24723).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to the Waitaki, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with the Waitaki

The name Waitaki (a South Island variant of the name Waitangi which is found throughout the North Island) is a common place name throughout Polynesia. Although the specific tradition behind the name has been lost in this case, it literally means ""the waterway of tears"", and the Waitaki is often referred to in whaikōrero (oratory) as representing the tears of Aoraki which spill into Lake Pūkaki and eventually make their way south along the river to the coast. This image is captured in the whakatauākī: ""Ko Waitaki te awa, kā roimata nā Aoraki i riringi"" (""Waitaki is the river, the tears spilled by Aoraki"").

For Ngāi Tahu, traditions such as this represent the links between the cosmological world of the gods and present generations, these histories reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

The Ngāi Tahu association with the Waitaki extends back to the first human habitation of Te Wai Pounamu. As such, the river is an essential element of the identity of Ngāi Tahu as an iwi. A moa butchery site at the mouth of the river is one of the oldest recorded settlement sites in the island and other sites further up the river are also extremely ancient.

The Waitaki was a traditional route to the mahinga kai resources of inland North Otago and the once bush-clad Waitaki Valley. The use of mōkihi (river craft constructed from raupō, or reeds), to carry the spoils of hunting expeditions down the river is particularly associated with the Waitaki, one of the few places where the construction and navigation of these vessels is still practised to this day.

The river also led to the central lakes district -- itself a rich source of mahinga kai -- and from there across the Southern Alps to the treasured pounamu resource of Te Tai Poutini (the West Coast). The river served as a major highway for such travels from both North Otago and South Canterbury.

Thus there were numerous tauranga waka (or landing places) on the river. The tūpuna had an intimate knowledge of navigation, river routes, safe harbours and landing places, and the locations of food and other resources on the river. The Waitaki was an integral part of a network of trails which were used in order to ensure the safest journey and incorporated locations along the way that were identified for activities including camping overnight and gathering kai. Knowledge of these trails continues to be held by whānau and hapū and is regarded as a taonga. The traditional mobile lifestyle of the people led to their dependence on the resources of the river.

In 1877, the religious leader Te Maiharoa, a descendant of Te Rakaihautu, led his people up the Waitaki to establish a settlement at Te Ao Mārama (near modern-day Ōmārama), to demonstrate his assertion that the interior had not been sold by Ngāi Tahu, and therefore still belonged to the iwi. Although the settlement was eventually broken up by the constabulary, and the people forced to retreat back down the river, the episode is a significant one in the long history of Te Kerēme (the Ngāi Tahu Claim).

As well as acting as a route to the inland mahinga kai sources, the river itself provided many forms of kai for those living near it or travelling on it. The Waitaki was and still is noted for its indigenous fisheries, including tuna (eel), inaka, kōkopu and kōaro species (whitebait), kanakana (lamprey) and waikōura (freshwater crayfish); with aua (yellow-eyed mullet) and mōhoao (black flounder) being found at the mouth. Many of these species are diadromous (migrating between sea and freshwater to spawn).

The extensive wetland areas formerly associated with the river once provided important spawning, rearing and feeding grounds for all of these species and were among the richest mahinga kai areas on the river. Although many of these species have now been depleted, the Waitaki remains a nationally important fishery.

The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the Waitaki, the relationship of people with the river and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

The Waitaki Valley holds one the country's major collections of rock art, and the river itself seems to have acted as a form of cultural ""barrier"" in rock art design. The surviving rock art remnants are a particular taonga of the area, providing a unique record of the lives and beliefs of the people who travelled the river.

Because of the long history of use of the river as both a highway and a mahinga kai, supporting permanent and temporary nohoanga (occupation sites), there are numerous urupā, wāhi tapu and wāhi taonga associated with the river. These are all places holding the memories, traditions, victories and defeats of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna, and are frequently protected by secret locations. Urupā are the resting places of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna and, as such, are a particular focus for whānau traditions.

The mauri of the Waitaki River represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the river.

##### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

Pursuant to [section 215][241], and without limiting the rest of this schedule, the only purposes of this statutory acknowledgement are---

## Schedule 73  
Statutory acknowledgement for Waituna Wetland

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the wetland known as Waituna, the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 58 (SO 12260).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Waituna, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Waituna

Intermittently open to the sea, Waituna wetland (with the western end, where the lagoon breaks out to sea known as Kā-puna-wai) was a major food basket utilised by nohoanga and permanent settlements located in the immediate vicinity of the wetlands, and further away, for its wide variety of reliable mahinga kai. The great diversity of wildlife associated with the complex includes several breeds of ducks, white heron, gulls, spoonbill, kōtuku, oyster-catcher, dotterels, terns and fernbirds. The wetlands are important kōhanga (spawning) grounds for a number of indigenous fish species. Kaimoana available includes giant and banded kōkopu, varieties of flatfish, tuna (eels), kanakana (lamprey), inaka (whitebait), waikākahi (freshwater mussel) and waikōura (freshwater crayfish). Harakeke, raupō, mānuka, tōtara and tōtara bark, and pingao were also regularly harvested cultural materials. Paru or black mud was available, particularly sought after as a product for making dyes.

The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of Waituna, the relationship of people with the lake and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

As a result of this history of use and occupation of the area, there are wāhi tapu and wāhi taonga all along its shores. It is also possible that particular sections of the wetland were used for waiwhakaheketūpāpāku (water burial).

Urupā and wāhi tapu are the resting places of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna and, as such, are the focus for whānau traditions. These are places holding the memories, traditions, victories and defeats of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna, and are frequently protected by secret locations.

The mauri of Waituna represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the area.

##### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

Pursuant to [section 215][241], and without limiting the rest of this schedule, the only purposes of this statutory acknowledgement are---
    
*   (a) to require that consent authorities forward summaries of resource consent applications to Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu as required by regulations made pursuant to [section 207][233] (clause 12.2.3 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (b) to require that consent authorities, Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga, or the Environment Court, as the case may be, have regard to this statutory acknowledgement in relation to Waituna, as provided in [sections 208 to 210][234] (clause 12.2.4 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (c) to empower the Minister responsible for management of Waituna or the Commissioner of Crown Lands, as the case may be, to enter into a Deed of Recognition as provided in [section 212][238] (clause 12.2.6 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (d) to enable Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu and any member of Ngāi Tahu Whānui to cite this statutory acknowledgement as evidence of the association of Ngāi Tahu to Waituna as provided in [section 211][237] (clause 12.2.5 of the deed of settlement).

##### Limitations on effect of statutory acknowledgement

Except as expressly provided in [sections 208 to 211][234], [213][239], and [215][241],---
    
*   (a) this statutory acknowledgement does not affect, and is not to be taken into account in, the exercise of any power, duty, or function by any person or entity under any statute, regulation, or bylaw; and

*   (b) without limiting paragraph (a), no person or entity, in considering any matter or making any decision or recommendation under any statute, regulation, or bylaw, may give any greater or lesser weight to Ngāi Tahu's association to Waituna (as described in this statutory acknowledgement) than that person or entity would give under the relevant statute, regulation, or bylaw, if this statutory acknowledgement did not exist in respect of Waituna.

Except as expressly provided in this Act, this statutory acknowledgement does not affect the lawful rights or interests of any person who is not a party to the deed of settlement.

Except as expressly provided in this Act, this statutory acknowledgement does not, of itself, have the effect of granting, creating, or providing evidence of any estate or interest in, or any rights of any kind whatsoever relating to, Waituna.

## Schedule 74  
Statutory acknowledgement for Waipara River

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the river known as Waipara, the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 113 (SO 19849).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to the Waipara River, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with the Waipara River

Tradition tells of the duel between two famous rangatira (chiefs) which happened in this area. Tūtewaimate, a Ngāti Mamoe rangatira from Rakaia, found that the northward trade route that he sent his goods along was being disrupted by Moko, a rangatira of the Ngāti Kurī hapū of Ngāi Tahu who had been acting as a bandit along the route. Tūtewaimate went to confront Moko, who lived in a cave at Waipara, but found him sleeping. Tūtewaimate allowed Moko to awake before attacking him. Tūtewaimate's sense of fair play cost him his life and is recalled in a tribal proverb.

For Ngāi Tahu, histories such as this reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

There are a number of Ngāti Wairaki, Ngāti Mamoe and Ngāi Tahu urupā and wāhi tapu along the river and associated coastline. Urupā are the resting places of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna and, as such, are the focus for whānau traditions. Urupā and wāhi tapu are places holding the memories, traditions, victories and defeats of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna, and are frequently protected by secret locations.

The river and associated coastline was also a significant mahinga kai, with kai moana, particularly paua, being taken at the mouth. The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the river, the relationship of people with the river and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

The mauri of the Waipara River represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the river.

## Schedule 75  
Statutory acknowledgement for Whakatipu-wai-māori (Lake Wakatipu)

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the lake known as Whakatipu-wai-māori (Lake Wakatipu), the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 39 (SO 24720).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Whakatipu-wai-māori, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Whakatipu-wai-māori

The name Whakatipu-wai-māori originates from the earliest expedition of discovery made many generations ago by the tupuna Rakaihautu and his party from the Uruao waka. Rakaihautu is traditionally credited with creating the great waterways of the interior of the island with his famous kō (a tool similar to a spade), known as Tū Whakaroria and renamed Tuhiraki at the conclusion of the expedition.

There are many traditions relating to the lake. One of the most famous tells that the hollow which forms the bed of the lake was created when the people known as Te Rapuwai came upon the giant tipua (ogre) Matau as he lay there in a deep sleep. Matau had been responsible for the disappearance of many small hunting parties and had entrapped a beautiful maiden, Manatā. The father of Manatā offered her in marriage to the man who could bring her safely home. Matakauri, who was in love with Manatā, ventured forth, discovering that Matau slept when the northwest wind blew. Matakauri selected a day when the wind was blowing the right way and set forth. He found Manatā and, using his mere, he attempted to sever the bonds which held her, but try as he would he failed. Manatā began to sob bitterly, and as her tears fell on the cords, they melted away. Matakauri carried Manatā back to the village where they became man and wife. However, Matakauri knew that while Matau lived no maiden was safe, so he set forth when again the northwest wind blew, and set fire to the large growth of bracken that acted as a bed for the giant. Matau was smothered in flames, the fat from his body augmenting the fire, until the blaze was so fierce that it burned a hole more than 1,000 feet deep. The snow on the surrounding hills melted and filled the hole, which is known today as Lake Wakatipu.

For Ngāi Tahu, traditions such as this represent the links between the cosmological world of the gods and present generations, these histories reinforce tribal identity and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

Whakatipu-wai-māori once supported nohoanga and villages which were the seasonal destinations of Otago and Murihiku (Southland) whānau and hapū for many generations, exercising ahi kā and accessing mahinga kai and providing a route to access the treasured pounamu located beyond the head of the lake. Strategic marriages between hapū strengthened the kupenga (net) of whakapapa and thus rights to use the resources of the lake. It is because of these patterns of activity that the lake continues to be important to rūnanga located in Murihiku, Otago and beyond. These rūnanga carry the responsibilities of kaitiaki in relation to the area, and are represented by the tribal structure, Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu.

The lake also supported permanent settlements, such as the kaika (village) Tahuna near present-day Queenstown, Te Kirikiri Pā, located where the Queenstown gardens are found today, a Ngāti Mamoe kaika near the Kawarau Falls called Ō Te Roto, and another called Takerehaka near Kingston. The Ngāti Mamoe chief Tu Wiri Roa had a daughter, Haki Te Kura, who is remembered for her feat of swimming across the lake from Tāhuna, a distance of some three kilometres.

The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the lake, the relationship of people with the lake and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

A key attraction of the lake was the access it provided to seasonal campsites and the pounamu located at the head of the lake at the Dart and Routeburn River catchments, from which countless generations gathered inaka and koko-takiwai pounamu and transported it back to coastal settlements for fashioning into tools, ornaments and weapons.

Waka and mōkihi were the key modes of transport for the pounamu trade, travelling the length and breadth of Whakatipu-wai-māori. Thus there were numerous tauranga waka (landing places) on the lake and the islands upon it (Matau and Wāwāhi-waka). The tūpuna had an intimate knowledge of navigation, river routes, safe harbours and landing places, and the locations of food and other resources on the lake. The lake was an integral part of a network of trails which were used in order to ensure the safest journey and incorporated locations along the way that were identified for activities including camping overnight and gathering kai. Knowledge of these trails continues to be held by whānau and hapū and is regarded as a taonga. The traditional mobile lifestyle of the people led to their dependence on the resources of the roto (lake).

Whakatipu-wai-māori is an important source of freshwater, the lake itself being fed by hukawai (melt waters). These are waters with the highest level of purity and were accorded traditional classifications by Ngāi Tahu that recognised this value. Thus it is a puna (spring) which sustains many ecosystems important to Ngāi Tahu. The mauri of Whakatipu-wai-māori represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the lake.

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Whakamatau, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Whakamatau

Whakamatau is one of the lakes referred to in the tradition of ""Ngā Puna Wai Karikari o Rakaihautu"" which tells how the principal lakes of Te Wai Pounamu were dug by the rangatira (chief) Rakaihautu. Rakaihautu was the captain of the canoe, Uruao, which brought the tribe, Waitaha, to New Zealand. Rakaihautu beached his canoe at Whakatū (Nelson). From Whakatū, Rakaihautu divided the new arrivals in two, with his son taking one party to explore the coastline southwards and Rakaihautu taking another southwards by an inland route. On his inland journey southward, Rakaihautu used his famous kō (a tool similar to a spade) to dig the principal lakes of Te Wai Pounamu, including Whakamatau.

For Ngāi Tahu, traditions such as this represent the links between the cosmological world of the gods and present generations, these histories reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

This lake was occupied by the Ngāti Tū Te Piriraki hapū. Tū Te Piriraki was the son of Tū Te Kawa, a Ngāti Mamoe chief who held manawhenua in this region. When Tū Te Kawa died his family, including Tū Te Piriraki, married into the senior Ngāi Tahu families. Such strategic marriages between hapū strengthened the kupenga (net) of whakapapa and thus rights to use the resources of the lake.

Whakamatau was a notable mahinga kai where tuna (eel) and water fowl were taken. The kiore (polynesian rat) was also taken in this region. The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the lake, the relationship of people with the lake and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

Whakamatau was an integral part of a network of trails linking North Canterbury and Te Tai Poutini (the West Coast) which were used by the tūpuna in order to ensure the safest journey and incorporated locations along the way that were identified for activities including camping overnight and gathering kai. Knowledge of these trails continues to be held by whānau and hapū and is regarded as a taonga. The traditional mobile lifestyle of the people led to their dependence on the resources of the lake.

As a result of the area's history as a settlement site and part of a trail, there are many urupā associated with the lake. Urupā are the resting places of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna and, as such, are the focus for whānau traditions. These are places holding the memories, traditions, victories and defeats of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna, and are frequently protected by secret locations.

The mauri of Whakamatau represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the lake.

## Schedule 77  
Statutory acknowledgement for Whakarukumoana (Lake McGregor)

[ss 205][231], [206][232]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the lake known as Whakarukumoana (Lake McGregor), the location of which is shown on Allocation Plan MD 129 (SO 19856).

##### Preamble

Under [section 206][232], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Whakarukumoana, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Whakarukumoana

Whakarukumoana is one of the lakes referred to in the tradition of ""Ngā Puna Wai Karikari o Rakaihautu"" which tells how the principal lakes of Te Wai Pounamu were dug by the rangatira (chief) Rakaihautu. Rakaihautu was the captain of the canoe, Uruao, which brought the tribe, Waitaha, to New Zealand. Rakaihautu beached his canoe at Whakatū (Nelson). From Whakatū, Rakaihautu divided the new arrivals in two, with his son taking one party to explore the coastline southwards and Rakaihautu taking another southwards by an inland route. On his inland journey southward, Rakaihautu used his famous kō (a tool similar to a spade) to dig the principal lakes of Te Wai Pounamu, including Whakarukumoana.

For Ngāi Tahu, traditions such as this represent the links between the cosmological world of the gods and present generations, these histories reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

Draining into Takapo (Lake Tekapo) via Te Waiātekāmana, Whakarukumoana forms a part of the network of waterways and land-based mahinga kai in this part of the interior. This area was a part of the seasonal trail of mahinga kai and resource gathering, and hapū and whānau bonding. Knowledge of these trails continues to be held by whānau and hapū and is regarded as a taonga. The traditional mobile lifestyle of the people led to their dependence on the resources of the lake.

The lake was very productive, although the indigenous fishery has now been depleted. The warmer shallows are important habitats for tuna (eels) and indigenous fish which prefer such conditions. This rain-fed lake is a habitat for upland bully, common bully, long-finned eel and galaxids as well as introduced trout.

Waterfowl, including a range of duck species, crested grebe and weka (formerly) are another important mahinga kai associated with the lake. Flora gathered from land adjoining the lake included matagouri, taramea, tutu, tātaraheka, mānuka, snowgrass, and raupō. The succulent kiore (polynesian rat) was once an important food resource, as was the moa.

The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the lake, the relationship of people with the lake and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

The mauri of Whakarukumoana represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the lake.

##### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

Pursuant to [section 215][241], and without limiting the rest of this schedule, the only purposes of this statutory acknowledgement are---
    
*   (a) to require that consent authorities forward summaries of resource consent applications to Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu as required by regulations made pursuant to [section 207][233] (clause 12.2.3 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (b) to require that consent authorities, Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga, or the Environment Court, as the case may be, have regard to this statutory acknowledgement in relation to Whakarukumoana, as provided in [sections 208 to 210][234] (clause 12.2.4 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (c) to empower the Minister responsible for management of Whakarukumoana or the Commissioner of Crown Lands, as the case may be, to enter into a Deed of Recognition as provided in [section 212][238] (clause 12.2.6 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (d) to enable Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu and any member of Ngāi Tahu Whānui to cite this statutory acknowledgement as evidence of the association of Ngāi Tahu to Whakarukumoana as provided in [section 211][237] (clause 12.2.5 of the deed of settlement).

##### Limitations on effect of statutory acknowledgement

Except as expressly provided in [sections 208 to 211][234], [213][239], and [215][241],---
    
*   (a) this statutory acknowledgement does not affect, and is not to be taken into account in, the exercise of any power, duty, or function by any person or entity under any statute, regulation, or bylaw; and

*   (b) without limiting paragraph (a), no person or entity, in considering any matter or making any decision or recommendation under any statute, regulation, or bylaw, may give any greater or lesser weight to Ngāi Tahu's association to Whakarukumoana (as described in this statutory acknowledgement) than that person or entity would give under the relevant statute, regulation, or bylaw, if this statutory acknowledgement did not exist in respect of Whakarukumoana.

Except as expressly provided in this Act, this statutory acknowledgement does not affect the lawful rights or interests of any person who is not a party to the deed of settlement.

Except as expressly provided in this Act, this statutory acknowledgement does not, of itself, have the effect of granting, creating, or providing evidence of any estate or interest in, or any rights of any kind whatsoever relating to, Whakarukumoana.

## Schedule 80  
Tōpuni for Aoraki/Mount Cook

[ss 238][268], [239][269]

##### Description of area

The area over which the Tōpuni is created is the area known as Aoraki/Mount Cook, located in Kā Tiritiri o te Moana, shown as Aoraki on Allocation Plan MS 1 (SO 19831).

##### Preamble

Under [section 239][269] (clause 12.5.3 of the deed of settlement), the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional values relating to Aoraki, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu values relating to Aoraki

In the beginning there was no Te Wai Pounamu or Aotearoa. The waters of Kiwa rolled over the place now occupied by the South Island, the North Island and Stewart Island. No sign of land existed.

Before Raki (the Sky Father) wedded Papatūānuku (the Earth Mother), each of them already had children by other unions. After the marriage, some of the Sky Children came down to greet their father's new wife and some even married Earth Daughters.

Among the celestial visitors were four sons of Raki who were named Aoraki (Cloud in the Sky), Rakiroa (Long Raki), Rakirua (Raki the Second), and Rārakiroa (Long Unbroken Line). They came down in a canoe which was known as Te Waka o Aoraki. They cruised around Papatūānuku who lay as one body in a huge continent known as Hawaiiki.

Then, keen to explore, the voyagers set out to sea, but no matter how far they travelled, they could not find land. They decided to return to their celestial home but the karakia (incantation) which should have lifted the waka (canoe) back to the heavens failed and their craft ran aground on a hidden reef, turning to stone and earth in the process.

The waka listed and settled with the west side much higher out of the water than the east. Thus the whole waka formed the South Island, hence the name: Te Waka o Aoraki. Aoraki and his brothers clambered on to the high side and were turned to stone. They are still there today. Aoraki is the mountain known to Pākehā as Mount Cook, and his brothers are the next highest peaks near him. The form of the island as it now is owes much to the subsequent deeds of Tū Te Rakiwhānoa, who took on the job of shaping the land to make it fit for human habitation.

For Ngāi Tahu, traditions such as this represent the links between the cosmological world of the gods and present generations, these histories reinforce tribal identity and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

The meltwaters that flow from Aoraki are sacred. On special occasions of cultural moment, the blessings of Aoraki are sought through taking of small amounts of its ""special"" waters, back to other parts of the island for use in ceremonial occasions.

The mauri of Aoraki represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the mountain.

The saying ""He kapua kei runga i Aoraki, whakarewa, whakarewa"" (""The cloud that floats aloft Aoraki, for ever fly, stay aloft"") refers to the cloud that often surrounds Aoraki. Aoraki does not always ""come out"" for visitors to see, just as that a great chief is not always giving audience, or on ""show"". It is for Aoraki to choose when to emerge from his cloak of mist, a power and influence that is beyond mortals, symbolising the mana of Aoraki.

To Ngāi Tahu, Aoraki represents the most sacred of ancestors, from whom Ngāi Tahu descend and who provides the iwi with its sense of communal identity, solidarity and purpose. It follows that the ancestor embodied in the mountain remains the physical manifestation of Aoraki, the link between the supernatural and the natural world. The tapu associated with Aoraki is a significant dimension of the tribal value, and is the source of the power over life and death which the mountain possesses.

## Schedule 81  
Tōpuni for Kahurangi

[ss 238][268], [239][269]

##### Description of area

The area over which the Tōpuni is created is the area known as Kahurangi, located in Kahurangi National Park, as shown on Allocation Plan MS 21 (SO 15490).

##### Preamble

Under [section 239][269] (clause 12.5.3 of the deed of settlement), the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional values relating to Kahurangi, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu values relating to Kahurangi

Kahurangi is a tremendously significant landmark to Ngāi Tahu, marking the extreme north western point of the tribal takiwā. It is a distinctive and easily recognisable physical boundary marker. The name ""Kahurangi"", which, in full, is said to be ""Te Kahu o te Rangi"" (""the blue skies of Rangi""), refers to the temperate climate of this part of the coast, which is noted for its clear skies.

Kahurangi was a natural landing point for seafarers travelling south by waka, to prepare for the next stage along a section of coastline that had very few safe anchorages or landing sites. Such tauranga waka (landing places) represent the intimate knowledge the tūpuna (ancestors) had of navigation, river routes, safe harbours and landing places, and the locations of food and other resources. The traditional mobile lifestyle of the people led to their dependence on the resources of the land. Knowledge of these routes and trails continues to be held by whānau and hapū and is regarded as a taonga.

To Ngāi Tahu, Kahurangi is an important expression of the iwi's mana over the vast tract of land to the south. Its significance in this respect is to be marked by the construction of a pou whenua (boundary marker). Ngāi Tahu have expended great effort and human sacrifice over many generations to maintain the security and integrity of their takiwā.

The mauri of Kahurangi represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with Kahurangi.

The area over which the Tōpuni is created is the area known as the Castle Hill Conservation Area, as shown on Allocation Plan MS 14 (SO 19832).

##### Preamble

Under [section 239][269] (clause 12.5.3 of the deed of settlement), the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional values relating to Kura Tāwhiti (Castle Hill), as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu values relating to Kura Tāwhiti (Castle Hill)

Kura Tāwhiti (Castle Hill) is located between the Torlesse and Craigieburn Ranges, in the Broken Hill catchment. The name Kura Tāwhiti literally means ""the treasure from a distant land"", and is an allusion to the kūmara, an important food once cultivated in this region. However, Kura Tāwhiti was also the name of one of the tūpuna (ancestors) who was aboard the Arai Te Uru canoe when it sank off Matakaea (Shag Point) in North Otago.

Kura Tāwhiti was one of the mountains claimed by the Ngāi Tahu ancestor, Tane Tiki. Tane Tiki claimed this mountain range for his daughter Hine Mihi because he wanted the feathers from the kākāpō taken in this area to make a cloak for her.

For Ngāi Tahu, traditions such as this represent the links between the cosmological world of the gods and present generations, these histories reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

This region was a well used mahinga kai for Kaiapoi Ngāi Tahu. The main food taken from this mountain range was the kiore (polynesian rat). Other foods taken included tuna (eel), kākāpō, weka and kiwi.

The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the Kura Tāwhiti, the relationship of people with the land and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

Kura Tāwhiti was an integral part of a network of trails which were used in order to ensure the safest journey and incorporated locations along the way that were identified for activities including camping overnight and gathering kai (food). Knowledge of these trails continues to be held by whānau and hapū and is regarded as a taonga. The traditional mobile lifestyle of the people led to their dependence on the resources of the area.

A particular taonga of Kura Tāwhiti are the ancient rock art remnants found on the rock outcrops. These outcrops provided vital shelters from the elements for the people in their travels, and they left their artworks behind as a record of their lives and beliefs. The combination of the long association with these rock outcrops, and the significance of the artwork on them, give rise to their tapu status for Ngāi Tahu.

The mauri of Kura Tāwhiti represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the area.

Tōpuni for Matakaea (Shag Point)

[ss 238][268], [239][269]

##### Description of area

The area over which the Tōpuni is created is the area known as Matakaea Recreation Reserve and Onewhenua Historic Reserve, as shown on Allocation Plan MS 9 (SO 24686).

##### Preamble

Under [section 239][269] (clause 12.5.3 of the deed of settlement), the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional values relating to Matakaea (Shag Point), as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu values relating to Matakaea (Shag Point)

The name ""Matakaea"" recalls the tradition of the Arai Te Uru canoe, which capsized off Moeraki. From Moeraki, the crew managed to swim ashore, leaving the cargo to be taken ashore by the waves. The crew members fled inland and were transformed into the mountains which form the Southern Alps.

The Arai Te Uru tradition is also important because it explains the origins of kūmara. The story originally began with Roko i Tua who came to Aotearoa and met the Kāhui Tipua. The Kāhui Tipua gave Roko i Tua mamaku (tree fern) to eat. However Roko i Tua preferred the kūmara that he had in his belt which he took out and soaked in a bowl of water. The Kāhui Tipua tasted the kūmara and asked where it was from. Roko i Tua replied saying that the kūmara came from ""across the sea"".

The Kāhui Tipua then made a canoe and, under the leadership of Tū Kākāriki, went to Hawaiiki and returned with the kūmara to Aotearoa. The Kāhui Tipua planted the kūmara but the crop failed. However Roko i Tua had also sailed to Hawaiiki on the canoe called Arai Te Uru. Roko i Tua landed at Whangarā, Hawaiiki, and learnt the karakia (incantations) and tikanga (customs) connected with planting kūmara. Roko i Tua then gave his canoe to two crew members called Pakihiwitahi and Hape ki Tua Raki. The Arai Te Uru returned under the leadership of these two commanders and eventually foundered off the Moeraki Coast at Matakaea.

For Ngāi Tahu, traditions such as this represent the links between the cosmological world of the gods and present generations, these histories reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

The Matakaea area has been occupied for many centuries and is the site of numerous urupā and wāhi tapu. Urupā are the resting places of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna (ancestors) and, as such, are the focus for whānau traditions. Urupā and wāhi tapu are places holding the memories, traditions, victories and defeats of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna, and are frequently protected by secret locations.

The mauri of Matakaea represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the area.

## Schedule 84  
Tōpuni for Maukaatua Scenic Reserve

[ss 238][268], [239][269]

##### Description of area

The area over which the Tōpuni is created is the area known as Maukaatua located west of the Taieri Plains, as shown on Allocation Plan MS 23 (SO 24679).

##### Preamble

Under [section 239][269] (clause 12.5.3 of the deed of settlement), the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional values relating to Maukaatua, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu values relating to Maukaatua

Maukaatua is an ancient name brought to Te Wai Pounamu from distant homelands, and is one of a number of Māori place names that reappear in a recognisably similar form throughout the Pacific Islands and into Indonesia. The name thus serves as a reminder of the links between Ngāi Tahu and their whānaunga of Te Moana Nui a Kiwa (The Great Ocean of Kiwa---the Pacific Ocean).

Maukaatua stands guard over the interior of Otago and is a dominant feature, visible from many vantage points. Travellers by sea, along the Lower Taieri, travelling inland either side of Maukaatua or returning to the coast from inland could not escape the gaze of Maukaatua. The maunga (mountain) is imbued with spiritual qualities that were respected by the tūpuna (ancestors). The maunga was likened to a sleeping giant and was said to be the source of strange noises in particular winds or climatic conditions.

Maukaatua once sheltered kāinga (villages) within close proximity of its base, including one based at Whakaraupuka. The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the land, the relationship of people with the land and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

An urupā (burial site) is known to be located on the north shoulder of Maukaatua. Urupā are the resting places of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna and, as such, are the focus for whānau traditions. These are places holding the memories, traditions, victories and defeats of our tūpuna, and are frequently protected by secret locations.

Te Rūnanga Ōtākou has manawhenua (tribal authority over land) and carries the responsibilities of kaitiaki in relation to it. The Rūnanga is represented by the tribal structure, Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu.

The mauri of Maukaatua represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the land.

Tōpuni for Motupōhue (Bluff Hill)

[ss 238][268], [239][269]

##### Description of area

The area over which the Tōpuni is created is the area known as Motupōhue, as shown on Allocation Plan MS 8 (SO 12233).

##### Preamble

Under [section 239][269] (clause 12.5.3 of the deed of settlement), the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional values relating to Motupōhue as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu values relating to Motupōhue

The name Motupōhue is an ancient one, brought south by Ngāti Mamoe and Ngāi Tahu from the Hawkes Bay region where both tribes originated. The name recalls a history unique to the Ngāi Tuhaitara and Ngāti Kurī hapū that is captured in the line, ""Kei korā kei Motupōhue, he pāreka e kai ana, nā tō tūtae"" (""It was there at Motupōhue that a shag stood, eating your excrement"").

Oral traditions say that the Ngāti Mamoe leader, Te Rakitauneke, is buried upon this hill. Te Rakitauneke's saying was: ""Kia pai ai tāku titiro ki Te Ara a Kiwa"" (""Let me gaze upon Foveaux Strait""). Some traditions also place another Ngāti Mamoe leader, Tū Te Makohu, on this hill.

For Ngāi Tahu, histories such as this represent the links and continuity between past and present generations, reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and document the events which shaped Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

The mauri of Motupōhue represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with Motupōhue.

## Schedule 86  
Tōpuni for Ōtūkoro Iti

[ss 238][268], [239][269]

##### Description of area

The area over which the Tōpuni is created is the area known as Ōtūkoro Iti, located in Kahurangi National Park, as shown on Allocation Plan MS 488 (SO 15489).

##### Preamble

Under [section 239][269] (clause 12.5.3 of the deed of settlement), the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional values relating to Ōtūkoro Iti, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu values relating to Ōtūkoro Iti

The name Ōtūkoro Iti relates to a battle between Ngāti Rarua (a hapū of Ngāti Toa---one of Ngāi Tahu's northern neighbours) and Ngāi Tahu which took place in this area in the 1820s. It is said that the fighting began at sunrise on the fifth day of the month and ended only when the moon (referred to as a ""koro"" or ""old man"") rose. In the Ngāi Tahu account, Ngāti Rarua were the attackers, but after Ngāi Tahu held their own during battle, it was the northerners who retreated.

For Ngāi Tahu, histories such as this reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

As a result of the loss of life and blood spilt here during the battle, and the significance of the Ngāi Tahu victory, Ōtūkoro Iti is now regarded as a wāhi tapu. Such places hold the memories, traditions, victories and defeats of our tūpuna (ancestors).

Ōtūkoro Iti was an important kainga nohoanga (permanent settlement), the northern-most of Ngāi Tahu's traditional settlements on Te Tai Poutini (the West Coast of the South Island). It was also the closest traditional settlement to the tribal boundary point of Kahurangi. As such, it is a symbol of Ngāi Tahu's manawhenua (tribal authority) in this area.

Ōtūkoro Iti was one of very few safe landing sites on the coast of Te Tai Poutini for long distances to the south and north. Strategically, it was an important headland to maintain control over, and important tauraka waka (landing place) for travellers by sea, and represents the intimate knowledge which the tūpuna had of navigation, sea routes, safe harbours and landing places, and the locations of food and other resources on the coast and land. Ōtūkoro Iti was thus an integral part of a network of trails which were used in order to ensure the safest journey and incorporated locations along the way that were identified for activities including camping overnight and gathering kai. Knowledge of these trails continues to be held by whānau and hapū and is regarded as a taonga. The traditional mobile lifestyle of the people led to their dependence on the resources of the land.

The mauri of Ōtūkoro Iti represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the land.

## Schedule 87  
Tōpuni for Pikirakatahi (Mount Earnslaw)

[ss 238][268], [239][269]

##### Description of area

The area over which the Tōpuni is created is the area known as Pikirakatahi (Mount Earnslaw) as shown on Allocation Plan MS 4 (SO 24666).

##### Preamble

Under [section 239][269] (clause 12.5.3 of the deed of settlement), the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional values relating to Pikirakatahi (Mount Earnslaw), as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu values relating to Pikirakatahi (Mount Earnslaw)

The creation of Pikirakatahi (Mt Earnslaw) relates in time to Te Waka o Aoraki, and the efforts of Tū Te Rakiwhānoa. It is said that during its formation a wedge of pounamu was inserted into this mountain, which is the highest and most prominent peak in this block of mountains. The mountain is also linked to the travels of Rakaihautu, who dug out the great lakes of the interior with his kō (a tool similar to a spade), known as Tū Whakaroria and later renamed Tuhiraki at the conclusion of the expedition.

The origins of the name ""Pikirakatahi"" have been lost, but it is known that many places and physical features have more than one name, reflecting the traditions of the successive iwi who peopled the land. It is, however, likely that the name relates to Rakaihautu or subsequent people, as most of the prominent lakes, rivers and mountains of the interior take their name from the journey of Rakaihautu.

For Ngāi Tahu, traditions such as this represent the links between the cosmological world of the gods and present generations, these histories reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

Pikirakatahi was of crucial significance to the many generations that journeyed to that end of Whakatipu-wai-māori (Lake Wakatipu) and beyond. Staging camps for the retrieval of pounamu were located at the base of the mountain, while semi-permanent settlements related to the pounamu trade were located closer to the lake.

Pikirakatahi stands as kaitiaki (guardian) over the pounamu resource and marks the end of a trail, with the tohu (marker) to the pounamu resource sitting opposite on Koroka (Cosmos Peak). The tūpuna (ancestors) had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails, places for gathering kai (food) and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the land, the relationship of people with the land and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

The retrieval of large amounts of pounamu from this source, so far inland and over a range of physical barriers, attests to the importance of this resource to the economy and customs of the iwi over many generations. The people would also gather native birds for kai, and firewood with which to cook and provide warmth, from the forests covering the lower flanks of Pikirakatahi. Strategic marriages between hapū strengthened the kupenga (net) of whakapapa and thus rights to use the resources of the mountain. It is because of these patterns of activity that Pikirakatahi continues to be important to rūnanga located in Otago, Murihiku and beyond. These rūnanga carry the responsibilities of kaitiaki in relation to the area, and are represented by the tribal structure, Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu.

The mauri of Pikirakatahi represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with Pikirakatahi.

## Schedule 88  
Tōpuni for Ripapa Island, Lyttelton Harbour

[ss 238][268], [239][269]

##### Description of area

The area over which the Tōpuni is created is the area known as Ripapa Island Historic Reserve located in Whakaraupō (Lyttelton Harbour), as shown on Allocation Plan MS 29 (SO 19834).

##### Preamble

Under [section 239][269] (clause 12.5.3 of the deed of settlement), the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional values relating to Ripapa as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu values relating to Ripapa

Ripapa is significant to Ngāi Tahu, particularly the rūnanga of Canterbury and Banks Peninsula, for its many urupā (burial places). Urupā are the resting places of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna (ancestors) and, as such, are the focus for whānau traditions. These are places holding the memories, traditions, victories and defeats of our tūpuna, and are frequently protected by secret locations.

Ripapa was also a pā (fortress) of Taununu, a leading Ngāi Tahu warrior prominent during the 1820s. Taununu was a Kaikōura chief who had decided to live at Kaiapoi. However, after settling at Kaiapoi, Taununu saw that Ripapa was a better place to live, so he and his people moved on and settled on the island. Taununu fortified Ripapa Island to withstand attacks from tribes armed with muskets.

Taununu eventually became involved in an inter-tribal war and attacked a village at Te Taumutu. Because the Taumutu people were connected to the southern hapū of Ngāi Tahu, a chieftainess and seer called Hine-Haaka was sent south from Te Taumutu to seek reinforcements. Tradition tells that when Hine-Haaka arrived at Ruapuke, near Stewart Island, she composed a song telling Taununu to weep as in the morning he would be killed. Hine-Haaka's kai oreore (a chant that curses) ran thus:
    
*   Taununu of Bank's Peninsula

*   Weep for yourself

*   On the morning your bones will

*   be transformed into fishhooks

*   To be used in my fishing grounds to the South

*   This is my retaliation, an avenging

*   for your attacks

*   All I need is one fish to take my bait.

Taununu's pā was attacked from both sea and land by an alliance of related hapū from Southland, Otago and Kaiapoi. Hine-Haaka's vision was proved right. Taununu managed to escape this attack, but was later killed at Wairewa (Little River).

To end the hostilities between the two regions, the southern chiefs arranged for the daughter of Hine-Haaka, Makei Te Kura, to marry into one of the families of Rapaki Ngāi Tahu. This union took place in the mid-1800s, and peace was cemented between Rapaki and Murihiku Ngāi Tahu.

For Ngāi Tahu, histories such as this represent the links and continuity between past and present generations, reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and document the events which shaped Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

## Schedule 89  
Tōpuni for Takitimu Range, Southland

[ss 238][268], [239][269]

##### Description of area

The area over which the Tōpuni is created is the area known as Takitimu Range located in Murihiku (Southland), as shown on Allocation Plan MS 5 (SO 12232).

##### Preamble

Under [section 239][269] (clause 12.5.3 of the deed of settlement), the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional values relating to Takitimu as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu values relating to Takitimu

The Takitimu maunga (mountains) were named by Tamatea, the captain of the Takitimu waka (canoe) in memory of the waka after it struck trouble in Te Waewae Bay, and was eventually wrecked near the mouth of the Waimeha Stream.

Tradition states that the Takitimu waka was overtaken by three large waves known as Ō-te-wao, Ō-roko and Ō-kaka, followed by a cross wave, which resulted in the Takitimu being hurled well inland, with its cargo being strewn about. In some accounts the ranges inland from Te Waewae Bay are likened to the huge waves that caused the demise of the waka Takitimu. In other accounts the Takitimu maunga are considered to be the upturned hull of the waka.

For Ngāi Tahu, traditions such as this represent the links between the cosmological world of the gods and present generations, these histories reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events that have shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

Tamatea and his crew made their way overland from the site of the wreck. Tamatea likened the majestic and upright Takitimu maunga when he viewed them from the south coast, to the crew of the Takitimu struggling to control the waka in adverse conditions. During the overland journey past the Takitimu maunga Tamatea lost one of his party, a woman named Kaheraki who strayed away from the party and was captured by the maeroero (spirits of the mountain) and never seen again. Kaheraki had been betrothed to Kahungunu, who was a son of Tamatea.

The Takitimu maunga are, therefore, a symbolic reminder of the famous exploits of Tamatea in the south, and a reminder forever locked into the landscape, of the tupuna (ancestral) waka Takitimu, adding lustre to the noted spiritual values of the western Southland landscape. The Takitimu maunga are visible from all points of the Murihiku landscape, and are also a noted weather indicator.

The mauri of Takitimu represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the land.

## Schedule 90  
Tōpuni for Tapuae o Uenuku

[ss 238][268], [239][269]

##### Description of area

The area over which the Tōpuni is created is the area known as Tapuae o Uenuku as shown on Allocation Plan MS 100 (SO 7317).

##### Preamble

Under [section 239][269] (clause 12.5.3 of the deed of settlement), the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional values relating to Tapuae o Uenuku, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu values relating to Tapuae o Uenuku

The name Tapuae o Uenuku refers to the sacred footsteps of Uenuku. Uenuku was one of the principal Ngāi Tahu atua (gods), who is represented as a rainbow. Uenuku is often found in tribal traditions as a tupuna (ancestor) who instigates migration from Hawaiiki to New Zealand. According to the traditions of Kaikōura Ngāi Tahu, Uenuku cursed his son, Ruatapu, for an infringement on his tapu. The curse referred to the fact that Ruatapu's mother was of lowly origins, so that his younger brother, Paikea, was in fact his senior because of his mother's superior descent lines. Ruatapu's response was to attempt to kill all of the leading sons of the chiefs of Hawaiiki, including Paikea. Ruatapu took all of the sons out in a waka (canoe), then set about killing them with a spear. Paikea survived by diving overboard and swimming away. He was rescued by a whale and brought to New Zealand, where he eventually settled at Whangarā, on the East Coast of the North Island. There he coupled with a woman called Te Waiaruatuatai, who bore him Tahu Potiki, who went on to become the founding ancestor of Ngāi Tahu.

As well as being a reminder of the traditions of Paikea and Tahu Potiki, the mountain Tapuae o Uenuku is a manifestation of the tupuna Uenuku. Uenuku was more than just a human ancestor, he was an atua and thus is also seen manifested in the rainbow.

In another Ngāi Tahu tradition, Uenuku is portrayed as one of the survivors of the Arai Te Uru waka which foundered at Moeraki, on the north Otago coast. These survivors are now manifested as the Southern Alps. Uenuku continued further north where he too eventually turned to stone on the spot where the maunga (mountain) Tapuae o Uenuku now stands. Thus, when Ngāi Tahu refer to the old people's hair turning grey, they are speaking of the snow which caps the Southern Alps, including Tapuae o Uenuku.

These physical and enduring manifestations of tūpuna represent the links between the cosmological world of the gods and present generations. Creation stories and whakapapa recall links of fifty or more generations from the time of the Hawaiiki Pacific migrations. These traditional histories reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi. They are frequently woven around major landscape features.

In Ngāi Tahu oratory, Tapuae o Uenuku is likened to an overarching portal which must be crossed by all visitors from the North Island. For this reason, visitors to the takiwā of Ngāi Tahu are welcomed as ""Ngā Tapuae o Uenuku""---those whose feet have been made sacred by passing beneath Uenuku.

The mauri of Tapuae o Uenuku represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with Tapuae o Uenuku.

## Schedule 91  
Tōpuni for Te Koroka (Dart/Slipstream)

[ss 238][268], [239][269]

##### Description of area

The area over which the Tōpuni is created is the area known as the Dart/Slipstream Special Area as shown on Allocation Plan MS 306 (SO 24707).

##### Preamble

Under [section 239][269] (clause 12.5.3 of the deed of settlement), the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional values relating to Te Koroka (Dart/Slipstream), as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu values relating to Te Koroka (Dart/Slipstream)

The creation of Te Koroka relates in time to Te Waka o Aoraki, and the efforts of Tū Te Rakiwhānoa. The area is also linked to the travels of Rakaihautu, who dug out the great lakes of the interior with his kō (digging stick), known as Tū Whakaroria and renamed Tuhiraki at the conclusion of the expedition.

The actual slip from which the pounamu is gathered is known as Te Horo. The name of the mountain where the pounamu vein occurs is Koroka (or Koloka). When viewed from the right vantage point, Koroka resembles a reclining giant, the pounamu exiting the mountain, in fact, from the mouth of the giant. Captain Cook's men were informed while moored in Dusky Sound, of the giant in the interior that emits pounamu from his mouth.

For Ngāi Tahu, traditions such as these represent the links between the cosmological world of the gods and present generations, these histories reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

Te Koroka area itself represented the end of a trail. Staging camps for the retrieval of pounamu were located at the base of the mountain, with semi-permanent settlements located closer to the lake. The tūpuna (ancestors) had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails, places for gathering kai (food) and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the land, the relationship of people with the land and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

The retrieval of large amounts of pounamu from this source, so far inland and over a range of physical barriers, attests to the importance of this resource to the economy and customs of the iwi over many generations. Pounamu transported back to coastal settlements was fashioned into tools, ornaments and weapons. The types of pounamu gathered were inaka and koko-takiwai. Strategic marriages between hapū strengthened the kupenga (net) of whakapapa and thus rights to access the pounamu resource. It is because of these patterns of activity that Te Koroka continues to be important to rūnanga located in Otago, Murihiku and beyond. These rūnanga carry the responsibilities of kaitiaki in relation to the area, and are represented by the tribal structure, Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu.

The actual area from which pounamu was collected is now, and was in traditional times, under a tapu until an appropriate karakia (incantation) and ceremony was performed to permit access and retrieval of a taonga that was of the highest value to iwi. The area is largely unmodified since it was last visited by the ancestors and is a taonga to be treasured. Periodic storms reveal, on the slopes below the ""collection"" site, large boulders of pounamu, brought to the surface through raging torrents of water rushing down the maunga (mountain).

The mauri of Te Koroka represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with Te Koroka.

The area over which the Tōpuni is created is the area known as Tititea (Mount Aspiring) as shown on Allocation Plan MS 2 (SO 24665).

##### Preamble

Under [section 239][269] (clause 12.5.3 of the deed of settlement), the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional values relating to Tititea, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu values relating to Tititea (Mount Aspiring)

As with all principal maunga (mountains), Tititea is imbued with the spiritual elements of Raki and Papa, in tradition and practice regarded as an important link to the primeval parents. Tititea is a prominent and majestic peak, clearly visible from a number of vantage points in the south, and its role in Ngāi Tahu's creation stories gives rise to its tapu status. From the heights above Te Ana-au (Lake Te Anau), it is a particularly impressive sight when the sun is setting.

The most common Ngāi Tahu name for the mountain known to Pākehā as Mount Aspiring is Tititea, referring to the mountain's white peak. It is not unusual, however, for places and physical features to have more than one name, reflecting the traditions of the successive iwi who peopled the land. Other names for the mountain include ""Mākahi Tā Rakiwhānoa"" (referring to a wedge belonging to Tū Te Rakiwhānoa) and ""Ōtapahu"", which may refer to a type of dogskin cloak.

The Bonar Glacier is known as Hukairoroa Tā Parekiore (which refers to the long, hard glacial ice and crevasses formed by Parekiore). Parekiore was a giant who used to stalk up and down the South and North Islands taking tītī (muttonbirds) northwards and returning with kūmara. The lakes represent his footprints and the frozen splashes from his footsteps in the south were transformed into glaciers.

For Ngāi Tahu, traditions such as this represent the links between the cosmological world of the gods and present generations, these histories reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

The area was an integral part of a network of trails which were used in order to ensure the safest journey and incorporated locations along the way that were identified for activities including camping overnight and gathering kai. Knowledge of these trails continues to be held by whānau and hapū and is regarded as a taonga. The traditional mobile lifestyle of the people led to their dependence on the resources of the land.

The mauri of Tititea represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the area.

Tōpuni for Tūtoko

[ss 238][268], [239][269]

##### Description of area

The area over which the Tōpuni is created is the area known as Tūtoko located in Fiordland National Park, as shown on Allocation Plan MS 3 (SO 24747 (Otago Land District) and SO 12231 (Southland Land District)).

##### Preamble

Under [section 239][269] (clause 12.5.3 of the deed of settlement), the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional values relating to Tūtoko, as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu values relating to Tūtoko

The Fiordland area, within which Tūtoko stands, represents, in tradition, the raised up sides of Te Waka o Aoraki, after it foundered on a submerged reef and its occupants, Aoraki and his brothers, were turned to stone. These people are now manifested in the highest peaks in Kā Tiritiri o Te Moana (the Southern Alps). The fiords at the southern end of the Alps were carved out of the raised side of the wrecked Waka o Aoraki by Tū Te Rakiwhānoa, so as to make the waka (canoe) habitable by humans. The deep gorges and long waterways that are the fiords were provided as safe havens on this rugged coast, and stocked with fish, forest and birds to sustain humans.

For Ngāi Tahu, traditions such as this represent the links between the cosmological world of the gods and present generations, these histories reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events that have shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

Tūtoko is not, in fact, the original name of the maunga (mountain), but was applied by Dr J. Hector in 1863 after he met the old rangatira (chief) Tūtoko and his two daughters, Sara and May. The hills to the north of the Kōtuku River are named the Sara Hills, and those to the south, May Hills, after these daughters. The use of this name is seen as appropriate to Ngāi Tahu, as Tūtoko was an important rangatira of this region at that time, and is represented by the mountain.

Tūtoko is the kaitiaki (guardian) of Whakatipuwaitai, the westernmost creation of Rakaihautu and the southernmost kāinga (settlement) of Te Tai Poutini (West Coast) pounamu trails, which provides access to koko-takiwai (a type of pounamu) at Piopiotahi (Milford Sound) and Poison Bay further to the south. The kāinga was also an important staging post for travel into the Lake Wakatipu area via the Hollyford Valley. All of these trails, whether by land or by sea, lie under the shadow of Mt Tūtoko.

The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the land, the relationship of people with the land and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

Mountains such as Tūtoko are linked in whakapapa to the gods, and being the closest earthly elements to Raki the sky father, they are likened to the children of Raki and Papa, reaching skyward. The mauri of Tūtoko represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the land.

## Schedule 100  
Statutory acknowledgement for Te Tai o Marokura (Kaikōura Coastal Marine Area)

[ss 205][231], [312][351], [313][352]

##### Statutory area

The area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is Te Tai ō Marokura (the Kaikōura Coastal Marine Area), the Coastal Marine Area of the Kaikōura constituency of the former Nelson Marlborough region, as shown on SO 14497, Marlborough Land District, extended northwards (but not eastwards) to the Takiwā of Ngāi Tahu Whānui, such boundary determined in the same manner as for the northern boundary of the Ngāi Tahu Claim Area, as shown on Allocation Plan NT 505 (SO 19901).

##### Preamble

Under [section 313][352], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Te Tai o Marokura as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Te Tai o Marokura

The formation of the coastline of Te Wai Pounamu relates to the tradition of Te Waka o Aoraki, which foundered on a submerged reef, leaving its occupants, Aoraki and his brothers, to turn to stone. They are manifested now in the highest peaks in the Kā Tiritiri o Te Moana (the Southern Alps). The bays, inlets, estuaries and fiords which stud the coast are all the creations of Tū Te Rakiwhānoa, who took on the job of making the island suitable for human habitation.

For Ngāi Tahu, traditions such as these represent the links between the cosmological world of the gods and present generations. These histories reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

The Kaikōura Coastline took its name from Tama Ki Te Rangi, an early explorer in the time of Tamatea Pōkaiwhenua, who decided to explore the South Island. On his way from the North Island, Tama ki Te Rangi stopped in the area now known as Kaikōura and ate some of the crayfish that populate the area over an open fire. From Tama Ki Te Rangi's feast on crayfish, the area was named, Te Ahi Kaikōura a Tama ki Te Rangi---the fires where Tama Ki Te Rangi ate crayfish.

Because of its attractiveness as a place to establish permanent settlements, including pā (fortified settlements), the coastal area was visited and occupied by Waitaha, Ngāti Mamoe and Ngāi Tahu in succession, who through conflict and alliance, have merged in the whakapapa (genealogy) of the Ngāi Tahu Whānui. Battle sites, urupā and landscape features bearing the names of tūpuna (ancestors) record this history. Prominent headlands, in particular, were favoured for their defensive qualities and became the headquarters for a succession of rangatira and their followers.

One of the leading sites in Kaikōura in pre-contact times was Takahaka marae, which is still occupied by Ngāi Tahu. From the time the Ngāi Tahu leader Maru Kaitātea took Takahaka Pā for Ngāi Tahu occupation, the site acted as a staging site for Ngāi Tahu migrations further south. Other pā in the area included Pariwhakatau, Mikonui, Ōaro and Kahutara. Place names along the coast, such as the gardens of Tamanuhiri and the Waikōau River, record Ngāi Tahu history and point to the landscape features which were significant to people for a range of reasons.

The results of the struggles, alliances and marriages arising out of these migrations were the eventual emergence of a stable, organised and united series of hapū located at permanent or semi-permanent settlements along the coast, with an intricate network of mahinga kai (food gathering) rights and networks that relied to a large extent on coastal resources.

As well as the crayfish for which the area is famous, the whole of the Kaikōura area offered a bounty of mahinga kai including a range of kaimoana (sea food); sea fishing; eeling and harvesting of other freshwater fish in lagoons and rivers; marine mammals (providing whale meat and seal pups); waterfowl, sea bird egg gathering and forest birds; and a variety of plant resources including harakeke (flax), fern and tī root.

A particular feature of the Ngāi Tahu relationship with the Kaikōura coastal area is the special connection with the whales which frequent the area. This relationship has its basis in tradition. The well-known rangatira (chief) and brave warrior of the Kāti Kurī hapū of Ngāi Tahu, Te Rakaitauneke, was said to have a kaitiaki whale, named Mata mata, who dwelt in the sea opposite Te Rakaitauneke's home in Tāhuna Tōrea (Goose Bay). Mata mata's sole duty and purpose in life was to do Te Rakaitauneke's bidding, to serve all his needs and to guard him against harm. Everywhere Te Rakaitauneke went, Mata mata went too. When Te Rakaiteuneke went to Takahanga, Mata mata could be seen blowing outside the garden of memories, as close to shore as he could possibly get. Te Rakaitauneke's love for Mata mata was as great as the whale's love for him.

After Te Rakaitauneke's death, Mata mata was not seen along the Kaikōura coast for some time, and it was rumoured that he had gone away and died of sorrow at the loss of his master. There were those, however, who remembered Te Rakaitauneke's prediction that after his death Mata mata would only return when one of his descendants was facing imminent danger or death. There are many stories since that time of a Mata mata appearing to foretell the death of one of Te Rakaitauneke's descendants. It is also said that many of the descendants of Te Rakaitauneke, when faced with peril on the high seas, have been saved by the timely intervention of a whale.

The Kaikōura coast was also a major highway and trade route, particularly in areas where travel by land was difficult. Travel by sea between settlements and hapū was common, with a variety of different forms of waka, including the southern waka hunua (double-hulled canoe) and, post-contact, whale boats plying the waters continuously. Hence tauranga waka (landing places) occur up and down the coast in their hundreds and wherever a tauranga waka is located there is also likely to be a nohoanga (settlement), fishing ground, kaimoana resource and rimurapa (bull kelp), with the sea trail linked to a land trail or mahinga kai resource. The tūpuna had a huge knowledge of the coastal environment and weather patterns, passed from generation to generation. This knowledge continues to be held by whānau and hapū and is regarded as a taonga. The traditional mobile lifestyle of the people led to their dependence on the resources of the coast.

Numerous urupā are being exposed or eroded at various times along much of the coast. Water burial sites on the coast, known as waiwhakaheketūpāpaku, are also spiritually important and linked with important sites on the land. Places where kaitāngata (the eating of those defeated in battle) occurred are also wāhi tapu. Urupā are the resting places of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna and, as such, are the focus for whānau traditions. These are places holding the memories, traditions, victories and defeats of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna, and are frequently protected in secret locations.

The mauri of the coastal area represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the coastal area.

##### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

Pursuant to [section 215][241] and without limiting the rest of this schedule, the only purposes of this statutory acknowledgement are---
    
*   (a) to require that consent authorities forward summaries of resource consent applications to Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu as required by regulations made pursuant to [section 207][233] (clause 12.2.3 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (b) to require that consent authorities, Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga, or the Environment Court, as the case may be, have regard to this statutory acknowledgement in relation to Te Tai o Marokura, as provided in [sections 208 to 210][234] (clause 12.2.4 of the deed of settlement); and

*   (c) to enable Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu and any member of Ngāi Tahu Whānui to cite this statutory acknowledgement as evidence of the association of Ngāi Tahu to Te Tai o Marokura as provided in [section 208][234] (clause 12.2.5 of the deed of settlement).

##### Limitations on effect of statutory acknowledgement

## Schedule 101  
Statutory acknowledgement for Te Tai o Mahaanui (Selwyn -- Banks Peninsula Coastal Marine Area)

[ss 205][231], [312][351], [313][352]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is Te Tai o Mahaanui (Selwyn -- Banks Peninsula Coastal Marine Area), the Coastal Marine Area of the Selwyn -- Banks Peninsula constituency of the Canterbury region, as shown on SO Plan 19407, Canterbury Land District as shown on Allocation Plan NT 505 (SO 19901).

##### Preamble

Under [section 313][352], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Te Tai o Mahaanui as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Te Tai o Mahaanui

The formation of the coastline of Te Wai Pounamu relates to the tradition of Te Waka o Aoraki, which foundered on a submerged reef, leaving its occupants, Aoraki and his brothers, to turn to stone. They are manifested now in the highest peaks in the Kā Tiritiri o Te Moana (the Southern Alps). The bays, inlets, estuaries and fiords which stud the coast are all the creations of Tū Te Rakiwhānoa, who took on the job of making the island suitable for human habitation.

The naming of various features along the coastline reflects the succession of explorers and iwi (tribes) who travelled around the coastline at various times. The first of these was Māui, who fished up the North Island, and is said to have circumnavigated Te Wai Pounamu. In some accounts the island is called Te Waka a Māui in recognition of his discovery of the new lands, with Rakiura (Stewart Island) being Te Puka a Māui (Māui's anchor stone). A number of coastal place names are attributed to Māui, particularly on the southern coast.

There are a number of traditions relating to Te Tai o Mahaanui. One of the most famous bays on the Peninsula is Akaroa, the name being a southern variation of the word ""Whangaroa"". The name refers to the size of the harbour. As with all other places in the South Island, Akaroa placenames recall the histories and traditions of the three tribes which now make up Ngāi Tahu Whānui: Waitaha, Ngāti Mamoe and Ngāi Tahu.

Waitaha traditions tell that after Rakaihautu had dug the southern lakes with his kō (a tool similar to a spade)---Tūwhakarōria---he and his son, Rokohouia, returned to Canterbury with their people. On the return, Rakaihautu buried his kō (a tool similar to a spade) on a hill overlooking the Akaroa harbour. That hill was called Tuhiraki (Bossu). Rakaihautu remained in this region for the rest of his life.

For Ngāi Tahu, traditions such as these represent the links between the cosmological world of the gods and present generations. These histories reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

Because of its attractiveness as a place to establish permanent settlements, including pā (fortified settlements), the coastal area was visited and occupied by Waitaha, Ngāti Mamoe and Ngāi Tahu in succession, who through conflict and alliance, have merged in the whakapapa (geneology) of Ngāi Tahu Whānui. Battle sites, urupā and landscape features bearing the names of tūpuna (ancestors) record this history. Prominent headlands, in particular, were favoured for their defensive qualities and became the headquarters for a succession of rangatira and their followers.

Ngāi Tahu connections to Akaroa came after the settling of Kaiapoi Pa in North Canterbury. Akaroa harbour was soon allocated to a number of chiefs by Tūrākautahi of Kaiapoi. One chief, Te Ruahikihiki, settled at Whakamoa near the Akaroa Heads at the south east end of the habour. Te Ruahikihiki fell in love with the elder sister of his wife, Hikaiti. As it was customary at that time for chiefs to have several wives, Te Ruahikihiki took the elder sister, Te Ao Taurewa, as his wife.

Hikaiti fell into a deep depression and resolved to kill herself. She arose early in the morning, combed her hair and wrapped her cloak tightly around herself. She went to the edge of the cliff where she wept and greeted the land and the people of her tribe. With her acknowledgements made, she cast herself over the cliff where she was killed on the rocks. The body remained inside the cloak she had wrapped around herself. This place became known as Te Tarere a Hikaiti (the place where Hikaiti leapt). After a long period of lamentation, Te Ruahikihiki and his people moved to the south end of Banks Peninsula to Te Waihora (Lake Ellesmere).

Another one of the senior chiefs within the Akaroa harbour was Te Ake whose hapū was Ngāi Tuhaitara. Ōtokotoko was claimed by Te Ake when he staked his tokotoko (staff) at that end of the bay. Te Ake's daughter, Hine Ao, is now represented as a taniwha that dwells with another taniwha, Te Rangiorahina, in a rua (hole) off Opukutahi Reserve in the Akaroa Harbour. Hine Ao now carries the name Te Wahine Marukore. These taniwha act as (kaitiaki) guardians for local fisherman.

The results of the struggles, alliances and marriages arising out of these migrations were the eventual emergence of a stable, organised and united series of hapū located at permanent or semi-permanent settlements along the coast, with a intricate network of mahinga kai (food gathering) rights and networks that relied to a large extent on coastal resources.

The whole of the coastal area offered a bounty of mahinga kai, including a range of kaimoana (sea food); sea fishing; eeling and harvest of other freshwater fish in lagoons and rivers; marine mammals providing whale meat and seal pups; waterfowl, sea bird egg gathering and forest birds; and a variety of plant resources, including harakeke (flax), fern and tī root.

The coast was also a major highway and trade route, particularly in areas where travel by land was difficult. Travel by sea between settlements and hapū was common, with a variety of different forms of waka, including the southern waka hunua (double-hulled canoe) and, post-contact, whale boats plying the waters continuously. Hence tauranga waka occur up and down the coast in their hundreds and wherever a tauranga waka is located there is also likely to be a nohoanga (settlement), fishing ground, kaimoana resource, rimurapa (bull kelp) with the sea trail linked to a land trail or mahinga kai resource. The tūpuna had a huge knowledge of the coastal environment and weather patterns, passed from generation to generation. This knowledge continues to be held by whānau and hapū and is regarded as a taonga. The traditional mobile lifestyle of the people led to their dependence on the resources of the coast.

Numerous urupā are being exposed or eroded at various times along much of the coast. Water burial sites on the coast, known as waiwhakaheketūpāpaku, are also spiritually important and linked with important sites on the land. Places where kaitāngata (the eating of those defeated in battle) occurred are also wāhi tapu. Urupā are the resting places of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna and, as such, are the focus for whānau traditions. These are places holding the memories, traditions, victories and defeats of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna, and are frequently protected in secret locations.

The mauri of the coastal area represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the coastal area.

## Schedule 102  
Statutory acknowledgement for Te Mimi o Tū Te Rakiwhānoa (Fiordland Coastal Marine Area)

[ss 205][231], [312][351], [313][352]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is Te Mimi o Tū Te Rakiwhānoa (Fiordland Coastal Marine Area), the Coastal Marine Area of the Te Anau constituency of the Southland region, as shown on SO Plan 11503, Southland Land District, as shown on Allocation Plan NT 505 (SO 19901).

##### Preamble

Under [section 313][352], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Te Mimi o Tū Te Rakiwhānoa as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Te Mimi o Tū Te Rakiwhānoa

The fiords of this region represent, in tradition, the raised up sides of Te Waka o Aoraki. The waka (canoe) foundered on a submerged reef and its occupants, Aoraki and his brothers, Rāraki, Rakiroa and others, were turned to stone. They stand now as the highest peaks of Kā Tiritiri o te Moana (the Southern Alps). The fiords at the southern end of the Alps were hacked out of the raised side of the wrecked waka by Tū Te Rakiwhānoa, in an effort to make it habitable by humans. The deep gouges and long waterways that make up the fiords were intended to provide safe havens on the rugged coastline, and stocked with fish, forest and birds to sustain travellers.

For Ngāi Tahu, traditions such as these represent the links between the cosmological world of the gods and present generations, these histories reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

Particular stretches of the coastline also have their own traditions. The visit of Tamaahua to Piopiotahi (Milford Sound) in search of Poutini, who had absconded with his wife Waitaiki, is linked to the creation of Pounamu further north on Te Tai Poutini (the West Coast). The koko-takiwai which is found in Piopiotahi has its basis in a visit to Piopiotahi by the waka Tairea. A woman, Koko-takiwai, and her children, known as Matakirikiri, were left behind by the Tairea and were turned into varieties of pounamu.

Place names along the coast record Ngāi Tahu history and point to the landscape features which were significant to people for a range of reasons. For example, in his voyage around the Sounds in the waka Takitimu, Tamatea gave the chiselled terrain the name ""Te Rua-o-te-moko"", likening the deep gouges adorning the impressive cliff faces of the fiords to the tattoos on a chief's face. Martins Bay (Whakatipu-waitai or Kōtuku) to the north of the fiords was the site of an old settlement, located to control the pounamu resources to be found here. An area of Doubtful Sound is known as Kahui-te-kākāpō, while Dagg Sound had a canoe harbour known as Te Rā. Breaksea Island (within Breaksea Sound---Te Puaitaha) is known as Te Au Moana, referring to the ocean current that sweeps around the inlet. Cape Providence is known as Ōrariki, a cliff near here is called Taka-o-te-karehu-Tamatea, referring to an episode when some tattooing ink belonging to Tamatea washed over board. Chalky Sound is known as Taiari and a rock in the Sound is known as Te Kakahu-o-Tamatea, a place where Tamatea had his clothes spread out to dry after being drenched by the salt spray. Preservation Inlet has the name Rakituma.

The area was visited mainly by Ngāti Mamoe and Ngāi Tahu, who had various routes and nohoanga for the purpose of gathering koko-takiwai and manu (birds), particularly the kākāpō. The area played a significant role in the history of conflict between Ngāi Tahu and Ngāti Mamoe, with a number of Ngāti Mamoe taking refuge in the isolation of the fiords in order to escape the unforgiving attitudes of some sections of Ngāi Tahu. The noted rangatira Tarewai from Otago Heads met his end here at the hands of Ngāti Mamoe, having pursued them from the Otago Peninsula to Rakituma. Tarewai and his warriors were successfully ambushed by those they were pursuing, with the result that no one ever returned to Otago from this battle. Te Whare Pā in Rakitimu was the scene of one of the last major battles between Ngāti Mamoe and Ngāi Tahu.

Another dark piece of history occurred at Te Tauraka o te Hupokeka (Anita Bay). Hupokeka and his whānau (family) regularly visited Piopiotahi, travelling from Murihiku to gather koko-takiwai, and staying at a nohoanga in Anita Bay. It was here, in the 1820s, that he and his whānau were slaughtered by sealers in retribution for an incident of which they were quite innocent.

Because of its attractiveness as a place to establish permanent settlements, including pā (fortified settlements), the coastal area was visited and occupied first by Ngāti Mamoe and later by Ngāi Tahu. Through conflict and alliance these two iwi have merged in the whakapapa (genealogy) of Ngāi Tahu. Battles sites, urupā and landscape features bearing the names of tūpuna (ancestors) record this history. Prominent headlands, in particular, were favoured for their defensive qualities and became the headquarters for a succession of rangatira and their followers. Notable pā and nohoanga occurred in many areas on the Fiordland coast including: Milford (Lake Marchant) and Caswell Sounds; Kahui-te-kākāpō (Doubtful Sound), known as the gathering place of the kākāpō, in reference to the gathering of kākāpō meat and feathers which was one of the key reasons that Ngāi Tahu Whānui regularly travelled to the fiords; Dagg Sound gets the sun all day, and consequently is well known as a nohoanga site, it also has a good canoe harbour known as Te Rā; Rakituma is the site of several pā or nohoanga, including one at Matauira and another at Te Whare Pā.

It was the koko-takiwai and kākāpō which primarily attracted Ngāi Tahu to Fiordland. The koko-takiwai is favoured as a softer type of pounamu, more easily shaped into a finer quality of end product. It was therefore particularly sought-after for the making of ornaments, such as hei-tiki. The area also offered many other mahinga kai to sustain parties on their arduous expeditions, including a range of manu (birds), fish and kaimoana resources.

The tūpuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the area, the relationship of people with the coastline and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to Ngāi Tahu today.

There are two principal trails linking the Fiordland coast with the rest of Te Wai Pounamu (the South Island). A sea route around the fiords links Piopiotahi to Murihiku, and was the main route by which the koko-takiwai gathered from that end of the fiords was transported. The inland route for transporting koko-takiwai by backpack lay over what is now known as the Milford track, over Ōmanui (McKinnon Pass), down the Waitawai (Clinton River) to the head of Te Ana-au (Lake Te Anau). From there, the pounamu would be transported by mokihi to the head of the Waiau River, and from there down the Waiau to Te Ara a Kiwa (Foveaux Strait). In addition, a trail from Martins Bay, up the Hollyford Valley and over into the Routeburn Valley to the pounamu source at the head of Lake Whakatipu-wai-māori, was commonly used by Tai Poutini iwi, who regularly travelled south via this route to obtain koko-takiwai.

Hence tauranga waka (landing places) occur up and down the coast and wherever a tauranga waka is located there is also likely to have been a nohoanga, fishing ground, kaimoana resource, with the sea trail linked to a land trail or mahinga kai resource. The tūpuna had a huge knowledge of the coastal environment and weather patterns, passed from generation to generation. This knowledge continues to be held by whānau and hapū and is regarded as a taonga. The traditional mobile lifestyle of the people led to their dependence on the resources of the coast.

The fiords are the repository of many kōiwi tāngata, secreted away in keeping places throughout the region. There are also many other wāhi tapu in the area, including examples of rock art in Chalky Sound. Urupā are the resting places of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna and, as such, are the focus for whānau traditions. Urupā and wāhi tapu are places holding the memories, traditions, victories and defeats of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna, and are frequently protected in secret locations.

The mauri of Te Mimi o Tū Te Rakiwhānoa represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the area.

## Schedule 103  
Statutory acknowledgement for Te Tai o Arai Te Uru (Otago Coastal Marine Area)

[ss 205][231], [312][351], [313][352]

##### Specific area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is Te Tai o Arai Te Uru (the Otago Coastal Marine Area), the Coastal Marine Area of the Moeraki, Dunedin Coastal and Molyneaux constituencies of the Otago region, as shown on SO Plans 24250, 24249, and 24252, Otago Land District, and as shown on Allocation Plan NT 505 (SO 19901).

##### Preamble

Under [section 313][352], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Te Tai o Arai Te Uru as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Te Tai o Arai Te Uru

The formation of the coastline of Te Wai Pounamu relates to the tradition of Te Waka o Aoraki, which foundered on a submerged reef, leaving its occupants, Aoraki and his brothers, to turn to stone. They are manifested now in the highest peaks in the Kā Tiritiri o Te Moana (the Southern Alps). The bays, inlets, estuaries and fiords which stud the coast are all the creations of Tū Te Rakiwhānoa, who took on the job of making the island suitable for human habitation.

The naming of various features along the coastline reflects the succession of explorers and iwi (tribes) who travelled around the coastline at various times. The first of these was Māui, who fished up the North Island, and is said to have circumnavigated Te Wai Pounamu. In some accounts the island is called Te Waka a Māui in recognition of his discovery of the new lands, with Rakiura (Stewart Island) being Te Puka a Māui (Māui's anchor stone). A number of coastal place names are attributed to Māui, particularly on the southern coast.

The great explorer Rakaihautu travelled overland along the coast, identifying the key places and resources. He also left many place names on prominent coastal features. Another explorer, Tamatea, sailed along the Otago coast in the waka Takitimu. After the waka eventually broke its back off the coast of Murihiku, Tamatea and the survivors made their way overland back to the North Island, arriving at the coast by the place Tamatea named Ō-amaru (Ōamaru).

Place names along the coast record Ngāi Tahu history and point to the landscape features which were significant to people for a range of reasons. For example, some of the most significant rivers which enter the coastal waters of Otago include: Waitaki, Kakaunui, Waihemo (Shag), Waikouaiti, Kaikarae (Kaikorai), Tokomairiro, Mata-au (Clutha), and Pounawea (Catlins). Estuaries include: Waitete (Waitati), Ōtākou (Otago), Makahoe (Papanui Inlet), Murikauhaka (Mata-au and Kōau estuaries), Tāhaukupu (Tahakopa Estuary), and Waipātiki (Wapati Estuary). Islands in the coastal area include Ōkaihe (St Michaels Island), Moturata (Taieri Island), Paparoa, Matoketoke, Hakinikini, and Aonui (Cooks Head).

Particular stretches of the coastline also have their own traditions. The tradition of the waka (canoe) Arai Te Uru and its sinking at the mouth of the Waihemo (Shag River) has led to the coastal area of Otago being known as Te Tai o Araiteuru (the coast of Arai Te Uru). Accounts of the foundering, the wreckage, and the survivors of this waka are marked by numerous landmarks almost for the length of the Otago coast. The boulders on Moeraki coast (Kai Hīnaki) and the Moeraki pebbles are all associated with the cargo of gourds, kūmara and taro seed which were spilled when the Arai Te Uru foundered.

For Ngāi Tahu, traditions such as these represent the links between the cosmological world of the gods and present generations. These histories reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

Because of its attractiveness as a place to establish permanent settlements, including pā (fortified settlements), the coastal area was visited and occupied by Waitaha, Ngāti Mamoe and Ngāi Tahu in succession, who, through conflict and alliance, have merged in the whakapapa (genealogy) of Ngāi Tahu Whānui. Battle sites, urupā and landscape features bearing the names of tūpuna (ancestors) record this history. Prominent headlands, in particular, were favoured for their defensive qualities and became the headquarters for a succession of rangatira and their followers. Notable pā on the Otago coast include: Makotukutuku (Oamaru), Te Raka-a-hineatea (Moeraki), Te Pā Katata, Pā a Te Wera, (Huriawa Peninsula), Māpoutahi (Pūrākaunui), Pukekura (Taiaroa Head), and Moturata (Taieri Island). The estuaries from the Waitaki River to the Chaslands also supported various hapū.

Tūpuna such as Waitai, Tukiauau, Whaka-taka-newha, Rakiiamoa, Tarewai, Maru, Te Aparangi, Taoka, Moki II, Kapo, Te Wera, Tu Wiri Roa, Taikawa, and Te Hautapanuiotu are among the many illustrious ancestors of Ngāti Mamoe and Ngāi Tahu lineage whose feats and memories are enshrined in the landscape, bays, tides and whakapapa of Otago.

The results of the struggles, alliances and marriages arising out of these migrations were the eventual emergence of a stable, organised and united series of hapū located at permanent or semi-permanent settlements along the coast, with an intricate network of mahinga kai (food gathering) rights and networks that relied to a large extent on coastal resources. Chiefs such as Kōrako (several), Tahatu, Honekai, Ihutakuru, Karetai, Taiaroa, Pōtiki, Tuhawaiki, and Pokene being some among a number who had their own villages and fishing grounds. Otago Peninsula (Muaupoko) had many kāinga nohoanga with a multitude of hapū occupying them. At one time up to 12 kāinga existed in the lower Otago harbour, some larger and more important than others.

The whole of the coastal area offered a bounty of mahinga kai, including a range of kaimoana (sea food); sea fishing; eeling and harvest of other freshwater fish in lagoons and rivers; marine mammals providing whale meat and seal pups; waterfowl, sea bird egg gathering and forest birds; and a variety of plant resources including harakeke (flax), fern and tī root. In many areas the reliance on these resources increased after the land sales of the 1840s and 1850s, and the associated loss of access to much traditional land-based mahinga kai.

Many reefs along the coast are known by name and are customary fishing grounds, many sand banks, channels, currents and depths are also known for their kaimoana. One example is Poatiri (Mt Charles - Cape Saunders) the name of which refers to a fish hook. Poatiri juts out into the Pacific, close to the continental shelf, and is a very rich fishing ground. Another example is Blueskin Bay which was once a kōhanga (breeding ground) for the right whale, although it is well over 150 years since it has seen this activity.

Other resources were also important in the coastal area. Paru (black mud used for dyeing) was obtained from some areas. Some of the permanent coastal settlements, such as those at the mouth of the Mata-au (Clutha River), and at Ōtākou and Pūrākaunui, were important pounamu manufacturing sites. Trading between these villages to the south and north via sea routes was an important part of the economy.

The Otago coast was also a major highway and trade route, particularly in areas where travel by land was difficult. Pounamu and tītī were traded north with kūmara, taro, waka, stone resources and carvings coming south. Travel by sea between settlements and hapū was common, with a variety of different forms of waka, including the southern waka hunua (double-hulled canoe) and, post-contact, whale boats plying the waters continuously. Hence tauranga waka (landing places) occur up and down the coast in their hundreds and wherever a tauranga waka is located there is also likely to be a nohoanga (settlement), fishing ground, kaimoana resource, rimurapa (bull kelp - used to make the pōhā, in which tītī were and still are preserved) with the sea trail linked to a land trail or mahinga kai resource. The tūpuna had a huge knowledge of the coastal environment and weather patterns, passed from generation to generation. This knowledge continues to be held by whānau and hapū and is regarded as a taonga. The traditional mobile lifestyle of the people led to their dependence on the resources of the coast.

Numerous urupā are being exposed or eroded at various times along much of coast. Water burial sites on the coast, known as waiwhakaheketūpāpaku, are also spiritually important and linked with important sites on the land. Places where kaitangata (the eating of those defeated in battle) occurred are also wāhi tapu. Urupā are the resting places of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna and, as such, are the focus for whānau traditions. These are places holding the memories, traditions, victories and defeats of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna, and are frequently protected in secret locations.

The mauri of the coastal area represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the coastal area.

## Schedule 104  
Statutory acknowledgement for Rakiura/Te Ara a Kiwa (Rakiura/Foveaux Strait Coastal Marine Area)

[ss 205][231], [312][351], [313][352]

##### Statutory area

The statutory area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is Rakiura/Te Ara a Kiwa (Rakiura/Foveaux Strait Coastal Marine Area), the Coastal Marine Area of the Hokonui and Awarua constituencies of the Southland region, as shown on SO 11505 and 11508, Southland Land District, as shown on Allocation Plan NT 505 (SO 19901).

##### Preamble

Under [section 313][352], the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Rakiura/Te Ara a Kiwa as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Rakiura/Te Ara a Kiwa

Generally the formation of the coastline of Te Wai Pounamu relates to the tradition of Te Waka o Aoraki, which foundered on a submerged reef, leaving its occupants, Aoraki and his brother to turn to stone. They are manifested now in the highest peaks of the Kā Tititiri of Te Moana (the Southern Alps). The bays, inlets, estuaries and fiords which stud the coast are all the creations of Tū Te Rakiwhānoa, who took on the job of making the island suitable for human habitation.

The naming of various features along the coastline reflects the succession of explorers and iwi (tribes) who travelled around the coastline at various times. The first of these was Māui, who fished up the North Island, and is said to have circumnavigated Te Wai Pounamu. In some accounts the island is called Te Waka o Māui in recognition of his discovery of the new lands. A number of coastal place names are attributed to Māui, particularly on the southern coast. Māui is said to have sojourned at Ōmaui (at the mouth of the New River Estuary) for a year, during which time he claimed the South Island for himself. It is said that in order to keep his waka from drifting away he reached into the sea and pulled up a stone to be used as an anchor, which he named Te Puka o Te Waka o Māui (Rakiura or Stewart Island).

The great explorer Rakaihautu travelled overland along the coast, identifying the key places and resources. He also left many place names on prominent coastal features. When Rakaihautu's southward exploration of the island reached Te Ara a Kiwa, he followed the coastline eastwards before heading for the east coast of Otago.

Particular stretches of the coastline also have their own traditions. Foveaux Strait is known as Te Ara a Kiwa (the pathway of Kiwa), the name relating to the time when Kiwa became tired of having to cross the land isthmus which then joined Murihiku (Southland) with Rakiura (Stewart Island). Kiwa requested the obedient Kewa (whale) to chew through the isthmus and create a waterway so Kiwa could cross to and fro by waka. This Kewa did, and the crumbs that fell from his mouth are the islands in Foveaux Strait, Solander Island being Te Niho a Kewa, a loose tooth that fell from the mouth of Kewa.

The waka Takitimu, captained by the northern rangatira (chief) Tamatea, travelled around much of Te Wai Pounamu coast, eventually breaking its back at the mouth of the Waiau River in Murihiku. Many place names on the coast can be traced back to this voyage, including Monkey Island near Ōrepuki which is known as Te-Punga (or Puka)-a-Takitimu. While sailing past the cliffs at Ōmaui it is said that Tamatea felt a desire to go ashore and inspect the inland, and so he turned to the helmsman and gave the order ""Tārere ki whenua uta"" (""swing towards the mainland""), but before they got to the shore he countermanded the order and sailed on. Subsequently the whole area from Ōmaui to Bluff was given the name of Te Takiwā o Tārere ki Whenua Uta. In olden days when people from the Bluff went visiting they were customarily welcomed on to the hosts' marae with the call, ""haere mai koutou te iwi tārere ki whenua uta"". One of the whare at Te Rau Aroha marae in Bluff if also named ""Tārere ki Whenua uta"" in memory of this event.

The Takitimu's voyage through the Strait came to an end and when the waka was overcome by three huge waves, named Ō-te-wao, Ō-roko and Ō-kaka, finally coming to rest on a reef near the mouth of the Waiau (Waimeha). According to this tradition, the three waves continued on across the low lying lands of Murihiku, ending up as permanent features of the landscape.

For Ngāi Tahu, traditions such as these represent the links between the cosmological world of the gods and present generations. These histories reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and continuity between generations, and document the events which shaped the environment of Te Wai Pounamu and Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

Because of its attractiveness as a place to establish permanent settlements, including pā (fortified settlements), the coastal area was visited and occupied by Waitaha, Ngāti Mamoe and Ngāi Tahu in succession, who through conflict and alliance, have merged in the whakapapa (genealogy) of Ngāi Tahu Whānui. Battle sites, urupā and landscape features bearing the names of tūpuna (ancestors) record this history. Prominent headlands, in particular, were favoured for their defensive qualities and became the headquarters for a succession of rangatira and their followers.

The results of the struggles, alliances and marriages arising out of these migrations were the eventual emergence of a stable, organised and united series of hapū located at permanent or semi-permanent settlements along the coast, with an intricate network of mahinga kai (food gathering) rights and networks that relied to a large extent on coastal resources.

Mokamoka (Mokomoko or Mokemoke) was one such settlement, in a shallow inlet off the Invercargill estuary. It was here that Waitai was killed, the first Ngāi Tahu to venture this far south, well out of the range of his own people, then resident at Taumutu. This settlement was sustained by mahinga kai taken from the estuary and adjoining coastline, including shellfish and pātiki (flounder).

Ōue, at the mouth of the Ōreti River (New River Estuary), opposite Ōmaui, was one of the principal settlements in Murihiku. Honekai who was a principal chief of Murihiku in his time was resident at this settlement in the early 1820s, at the time of the sealers. In 1850 there were said to still be 40 people living at the kaik at Ōmaui under the chief Mauhe. Honekai's brother, Pukarehu, was a man who led a very quiet life, and so was little known. He is remembered, however, in the small knob in the hills above Ōmaui which bears his name. When he passed away he was interred in the sandhills at the south end of the Ōreti Beach opposite Ōmaui. Ōue is said to have got its name from a man Māui left to look after his interests there until his return. It was also here that the coastal track to Riverton began. From Ōue to the beach the track was called Te Ara Pakipaki, then, when it reached the beach, it was called Mā Te Aweawe, finally, at the Riverton end, it was known as Mate a Waewae.

After the death of Honekai, and as a consequence of inter-hapū and inter-tribal hostilities in the Canterbury region, many inhabitants of Ōue and other coastal villages on Foveaux Strait relocated to Ruapuke Island, which became the Ngāi Tahu stronghold in the south. The rangatira Pahi and Tupai were among the first to settle on the island. Pahi had previously had one of the larger and oldest pā in Murihiku at Pahi (Pahia), where 40 to 50 whare (houses) were reported in 1828\. The [Treaty of Waitangi][857] was signed at Ruapuke Island by Tuhawaiki and others. No battles however occurred here, the pā Pā-raki-ao was never fully completed, due to the realisation that Te Rauparaha could not reach this far south.

Other important villages along the coast included: Te Wae Wae (Waiau), Taunoa (Ōrepuki), Kawakaputaputa (Wakaputa), Ōraka (Colac Bay), Aparima (Riverton---named Aparima after the daughter of the noted southern rangatira Hekeia, to whom he bequeathed all of the land which his eye could see as he stood on a spot at Ōtaitai, just north of Riverton), Turangiteuaru, Awarua (Bluff), Te Whera, Toe Toe (mouth of the Mataura River) and Waikawa.

Rarotoka (Centre Island) was a safe haven at times of strife for the villages on the mainland opposite (Pahi, Ōraka and Aparima). Numerous artefacts and historical accounts attest to Rarotoka as having a significant place in the Ngāi Tahu history associated with Murihiku.

Rakiura also plays a prominent part in southern history, the ""Neck"" being a particularly favoured spot. Names associated with the area include: Kōrako-wahine (on the western side of the peninsula), Whare-tātara (a rock), Hupokeka (Bullers Point) and Pukuheke (the point on which the lighthouse stands). Te Wera had two pā built in the area called Kaiarohaki, the one on the mainland was called Tounoa, and across the tidal strip was Kā-Turi-o-Whako.

A permanent settlement was located at Port Pegasus, at the south-eastern end of Rakiura, where numerous middens and cave dwellings remain. Permanent settlement also occurred on the eastern side of Rakiura, from the Kaik near the Neck, south to Tikotaitahi (or Tikotatahi) Bay. A pā was also established at Port Adventure.

Mahinga kai was available through access from the coastal settlements to Te Whaka-a-te-Wera (Paterson Inlet), Lords River and, particularly for waterfowl, to Toi Toi wetland. In addition, the tītī islands off the northeastern coast of the island, and at the mouth of Kōpeka River and the sea fishery ensured a sound base for permanent and semi-permanent settlement, from which nohoanga operated.

Te Ara a Kiwa, the estuaries, beaches and reefs off the mainland and islands all offered a bounty of mahinga kai, with Rakiura and the tītī islands being renowned for their rich resources of bird life, shellfish and wet fish. The area offered a wide range of kaimoana (sea food), including tuaki (cockles), paua, mussels, toheroa, tio (oysters), pūpū (mudsnails), cod, groper, barracuda, octopus, pātiki (flounders), seaweed, kina, kōura (crayfish) and conger eel. Estuarine areas provided freshwater fisheries, including tuna (eels), inaka (whitebait), waikōura (freshwater crayfish), kōkopu and kanakana (lamprey). Marine mammals were harvested for whale meat and seal pups. Many reefs along the coast are known by name and are customary fishing grounds, many sand banks, channels, currents and depths are also known for their kaimoana.

A range of bird life in the coastal area also contributed to the diversity of mahinga kai resources available, including tītī, seabirds such as shags and gulls, sea bird eggs, waterfowl, and forest birds such as kiwi, kākā, kākāpō, weka, kukupa and tieke. A variety of plant resources were also taken in the coastal area, including raupō, fern root, tī kōūka (cabbage tree), tutu juice and kōrari juice. Harakeke (flax) was an important resource, required for the everyday tasks of carrying and cooking kai. Black mud (paru) was gathered at Ocean Beach for use as dye. Tōtara bark was important for wrapping pōhā in, to allow safe transport of the tītī harvest. Pōhā were made from bull kelp gathered around the rocky coast.

The numerous tītī islands are an important part of the Ngāi Tahu southern economy, with Taukihepa (Te Kanawera) being the largest. Tītī were and are traded as far north as the North Island. The ""Hakuai"" is a bird with a fearsome reputation associated with the islands. No one has ever seen this bird, which appears at night, but it once regularly signalled the end to a birding season by its appearance at night. Known for its distinctive spine-chilling call, the hakuai was a kaitiaki that could not be ignored. At the far western edge of Foveaux Strait is Solander Island (Hau-tere), an impressive rock pinnacle rising hundreds of feet out of the sea, on which fishing and tītī gathering occurred.

The coast was also a major highway and trade route, particularly in areas where travel by land was difficult. Foveaux Strait was a principal thoroughfare, with travel to and from Rakiura a regular activity. There was also regular travel between the islands Ruapuke, Rarotoka and other points.

The tītī season still involves a large movement across the Strait to the islands, in addition large flotillas of Ngāi Tahu once came south from as far afield as Kaikōura to exercise their mutton-birding rights. Whenua Hou (Codfish Island) and the Ruggedy Islands were important staging posts for the movement of birders to the tītī islands off the south-west coast of Rakiura. Whenua Hou had everything that the birders required: shelter, proximity to the tītī islands, kai moana, manu (birds) and ngahere (bush). From Whenua Hou, the birders would camp at Miniti (Ernest Island), at the end of Mason Bay, where the waka-hunua (double-hulled canoes, or canoes with outriggers) were able to moor safely, ready for the final movement to the various tītī islands. Waka-hunua were an important means of transport on the dangerous and treacherous waters of Foveaux Strait and the Rakiura coast. After dropping birders and stores on the tītī islands the waka hunua generally returned immediately to Aparima and other tauranga waka along the mainland of Foveaux Strait, due to the paucity of safe anchorages among the tītī islands.

Travel by sea between settlements and hapū was common, with a variety of different forms of waka, including the southern waka hunua (double-hulled canoe) and, post-contact, whale boats plying the waters continuously. Hence tauranga waka occur up and down the coast, including spots at Pahi, Ōraka and Aparima, and wherever a tauranga waka is located there is also likely to be a nohoanga (settlement), fishing ground, kaimoana resource, rimurapa (bull kelp - used to make the pōhā, in which tītī were and still are preserved) and the sea trail linked to a land trail or mahinga kai resource. Knowledge of these areas continues to be held by whānau and hapū and is regarded as a taonga. The traditional mobile lifestyle of the people led to their dependence on the resources of the coast.

The New River Estuary contains wāhi tapu, as do many of the coastal dunes and estuarine complexes for the length of the Foveaux Strait. Many urupā are located on islands and prominent headlands overlooking the Strait and the surrounding lands and mountains. The rangatira Te Wera, of Huriawa fame, is buried at Taramea (Howells Point), near Riverton. There are two particularly important urupā in Colac Bay, as well as an old quarry site (Tīhaka). From Colac Bay to Wakapatu, the coastal sandhills are full of middens and ovens, considered to be linked to the significant mahinga kai gathering undertaken in Lake George (Urewera). Urupā are the resting places of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna and, as such, are the focus for whānau traditions. These are places holding the memories, traditions, victories and defeats of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna, and are frequently protected in secret locations.

The mauri of the coastal area represent the essence that binds the physical and spirtual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the coastal area.

## Schedule 108  
Statutory acknowledgement for Whenua Hou

[s 332][376]

##### Statutory area

The area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the area known as Whenua Hou, as shown on Allocation Plan SS 431 (SO 12251).

##### Preamble

Under [section 332][376] (clause 12.2.2 of the deed of settlement), the Crown acknowledges Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu's statement of Ngāi Tahu's cultural, spiritual, historic, and traditional association to Whenua Hou as set out below.

##### Ngāi Tahu association with Whenua Hou

Ko Whenua Hou te motu

Ko Waikoropupu te whaka

Ko Waituna te awa

Ko Te Ara a Kewa te moana

Ko Kāi Tahu, Kāti Mamoe, Waitaha kā iwi

Kei Kāi tahu Whānui

Te ihi, te wehi, te mana, te tapu

Tihei mauri ora!

Whenua Hou is an extremely important tūrangawaewae (literally ""a place to stand"") to Ngāi Tahu Whānui. Ngāi Tahu connect with Whenua Hou spiritually, culturally and physically.

Whenua Hou was also an important stopping-off point for birders converging on the tītī islands in their waka (canoes) and waka hunua (double-hulled canoes). The right to use this island in this way flowed from whakapapa (genealogy), just like the right to use the tītī islands themselves. Birders would use various kaika (settlements) and resting places on the island as a respite from their difficult travels.

One tragic account attests to the loss of life that occurred in the rough waters of Foveaux Strait. A waka hunua with about forty people aboard, commanded by the rangatira (chief) Te Pahi, foundered in heavy seas with the loss of all hands while on its journey from Whenua Hou to Ruapuke Island at the close of the mutton birding season. This was witnessed by Taiaroa and his people who were aboard an accompanying waka hunua, but were unable to offer assistance as their waka was also in dire circumstances. The harvesting of tītī from these rugged islands, despite such treacherous conditions, attests to the importance of this resource to the economy and customs of the iwi over many generations.

Despite Ngāi Tahu's long association with Whenua Hou, that name is not, in fact, the original name of this island, but commemorates an important time in more recent Ngāi Tahu history. It relates to the occasion when the rangatira Honekai declared the island as the place sealers and their Māori wives could stay under his protection. The reason for this was to remove the sealers from the Rakiura and mainland villages where they were annoying the Kāi Tahu women. Hence the new land (Whenua Hou) became the first European settlement in the south.

Many Ngāi Tahu are able to trace their whakapapa (genealogy) to these early unions between Ngāi Tahu women and European sealers. It is for this reason that Whenua Hou plays an extremely significant role in Ngāi Tahu's contemporary whakapapa. For Ngāi Tahu, histories such as this represent the links and continuity between past and present generations, reinforce tribal identity and solidarity, and document the events which shaped Ngāi Tahu as an iwi.

There are a number of urupā on Whenua Hou which are the resting places of Ngāi Tahu tūpuna and, as such, are the focus for whānau traditions. These are places holding the memories, traditions, victories and defeats of our tūpuna, and are frequently protected by secret locations.

Ngāi Tahu whānau from Murihiku have erected a pouwhenua (carved post denoting a tribe's relationship with an area of land) on Whenua Hou in memory of the Murihiku women who resided on the island. The establishment of such markers is significant in that they serve to reaffirm the tribe's association with the island, and to act as a tangible reminder of that association. The following waiata (song) was composed to commemorate the dedication of this pouwhenua:

Ka pouwhenuatia te motu o Whenua Hou hei tohu

maumahara mō kā uri whakatupu i raro ake kā iwi

whānui o Kāitahu me kā hapū karakamaha.

Ka titiro, kei te ora me te kaha tonu te mauri o te

iwi whānui i Kāitahu i roto kā tikaka i rātou

kua karo kanohi atu.

Ka herea a Kāitahu Whānui hei kaipupuri, i te ihi,

te wehi, te mana, te tapu o kā tikaka mō te

motu o Whenua Hou.
    
*   Ka ū, ka ū, kia kikii, kia kikii,

*   Ka tū te pō, ka tū te ao

*   mō ake ake tonu atu.

A symbol of ownership and remembrance was placed on the island Whenua Hou as a guardian for future generations of the families of Kāi Tahu Whānui. Looking on, seeing that the principal life source of Kāi Tahu's extended family is and will always be as it was in the days of those who have passed on. To this we tie ourselves as Kāitahu, being the traditional keepers of the gifts, the strength, humility, prestige, the sacredness, and all that Whenua Hou holds.
    
*   Hold fast, hold fast, tighter, tighter

*   let night come, let daylight come

*   for ever, ever, everlasting.

The mauri of Whenua Hou represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāi Tahu Whānui with the island.
