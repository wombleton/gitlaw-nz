    (2) Ka whakaaetia e te Karauna, nā te hokonga o te rohe whānui rawa e kīia ana ""ko Mahurangi me Ōmaha"" i te tau 1841, i takahi ai te [Tiriti o Waitangi][181] me ōna mātāpono:
        
    *   (a) nā te kore whakahaere uiuitanga i ngā mana tuku iho i te wā i hokona ai ēnei whenua;
    
    *   (b) nā te hokonga o ēnei whenua me te kore aronga atu me te whakaaetanga kore o Ngāti Manuhiri; ā

    (3) Ka whakaaetia anōtia e te Karauna:
        
    *   (a) Kikī ana ngā whenua o ""Mahurangi me Ōmaha"" i ngā rawa rākau nui te uaratanga, tae atu ki ngā ngahere kauri me te āheinga ngāwari ki te takutai;

    *   (d) I te wā i whakaaetia ai e te Karauna ngā pānga o Ngāti Manuhiri ki ēnei whenua, kua nuku kē ngā kainoho whenua ki roto i te rohe ā, ko te mutunga kē, kāhore he huarahi e wātea ana ki a Ngāti Manuhiri i tua atu i te whakaaetanga ki te kamupeniheihana me ngā whenua rāhui itiiti nei; ā

    (8) Ka whakaaetia e te Karauna te ngaronga atu o ngā wāhi tapu, tae atu ki ērā i hiahiatia ai e ngā rangatira o Ngāti Manuhiri te pupuri tonu ā, he kino tēnei mō te oranga ā-tikanga, ā-wairua o Ngāti Manuhiri.

    ###### Acknowledgement
    
    (1) The Crown acknowledges that it has failed to deal with the long-standing grievances of Ngāti Manuhiri in an appropriate way and that recognition, and provision of redress for these grievances is long overdue.
    
    (2) The Crown acknowledges that in purchasing the extensive area called ""Mahurangi and Ōmaha"" in 1841 it breached the [Treaty of Waitangi][182] and its principles by---
        
    *   (a) failing to conduct any investigation of customary rights when it purchased these lands; and
    
    *   (b) acquiring these lands without the knowledge and consent of Ngāti Manuhiri; and
    
    *   (c) failing to provide adequate compensation and reserves for the future use and benefit of Ngāti Manuhiri when it later learned of their interests in the purchase area.
    
    (3) The Crown further acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) the ""Mahurangi and Ōmaha"" lands contained rich timber resources including kauri forests and easy coastal access; and
    
    *   (b) the process whereby the Crown granted land to settlers within the purchase area, including "old land claims", compounded the prejudice arising from the 1841 transaction; and
    
    *   (c) it failed to properly survey and define the ""Mahurangi and Ōmaha"" purchase and that this, together with the Crown's subsequent timber licensing regime, caused confusion and uncertainty for Ngāti Manuhiri; and
    
    *   (d) by the time the Crown recognised Ngāti Manuhiri interests in these lands settlers had begun to move into the area and Ngāti Manuhiri were left with no option other than to accept compensation and inadequate reserves; and
    
    *   (e) it carried out further purchases from 1853 that overlapped with the ""Mahurangi and Ōmaha"" lands, and paid generally low prices for those lands.
    
    (4) The Crown acknowledges that the 1854 Mangawhai deed contained provision that ""ten per cent of the proceeds of the sale of this block ... is to be expended for the benefit of the Natives"", and that a payment was made to the vendors in 1874\. The Crown failed to keep adequate records after 1874 and the vendors received no identifiable benefit under the "ten per cent" provision from that date.
    
    (5) The Crown acknowledges that it punished a Ngāti Manuhiri chief for his role in a muru (ritualised plunder for compensation) of settlers at Matakana by pressuring him to cede his ancestral interests in land elsewhere that he wished to retain, and this was in breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi][182] and its principles.
    
    (6) The Crown acknowledges that the operation and impact of the native land laws, in particular the awarding of land title to individual Ngāti Manuhiri rather than to the iwi or hapū, made those lands more susceptible to partition, fragmentation, and alienation, and that this had a detrimental effect on Ngāti Manuhiri. This further contributed to the erosion of the traditional tribal structures of Ngāti Manuhiri. The Crown failed to take adequate steps to protect those structures and this was in breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi][182] and its principles.
    
    (7) The Crown further acknowledges that the Native Land Court title determination process carried significant costs, including survey and hearing costs, which at times led to further alienations of Ngāti Manuhiri land.
    
    (8) The Crown acknowledges the loss of Ngāti Manuhiri wāhi tapu, including those that Ngāti Manuhiri rangatira wished to retain, and that this loss was prejudicial to Ngāti Manuhiri cultural and spiritual well-being.
    
    (9) The Crown acknowledges that in acquiring Te Hauturu-o-Toi / Little Barrier Island it---
        
    *   (a) used monopoly powers to exclude private purchasers and prevent owners from generating revenue from the timber resources of the island; and
    
    *   (b) negotiated with individual share-holders rather than with the owners as a whole; and
    
    *   (c) promoted special legislation, the Little Barrier Island Purchase Act 1894, and used it to compulsorily acquire the shares of those individuals who refused to sell; and
    
    *   (d) showed blatant disregard for those Ngāti Manuhiri resident on the island, including persons who had refused to accept compensation for their shares taken under the Act, by forcibly evicting them in 1896\.
    
    The Crown acknowledges that it acted in an unreasonable and unfair manner to secure the ownership of Te Hauturu-o-Toi / Little Barrier Island and this conduct was in breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi][182] and its principles.
    
    (10) The Crown also acknowledges---
        
    *   (a) the title investigation process for Te Hauturu-o-Toi / Little Barrier Island damaged relationships within Ngāti Manuhiri and between them and their tribal neighbours; and
    
    *   (b) the loss of ownership of, and access to, Te Hauturu-o-Toi / Little Barrier Island has remained a source of ongoing grievance and sorrow for Ngāti Manuhiri.
    
    (11) The Crown acknowledges the generosity of spirit shown by Ngāti Manuhiri in agreeing that the Crown transfer Te Hauturu-o-Toi / Little Barrier Island, through this settlement, to Ngāti Manuhiri and that Ngāti Manuhiri gift it back to the Crown to ensure that Te Hauturu-o-Toi / Little Barrier Island remains a nature reserve for the benefit of the people of New Zealand.
    
    (12) The Crown acknowledges that it continued to purchase lands that had passed through the Native Land Court in which Ngāti Manuhiri held interests, including purchases from minors. The Crown also acknowledges that it failed to monitor the impact of its purchases on Ngāti Manuhiri landholdings and, despite the clear implications of the Stout--Ngata Royal Commission's findings in 1907, continued to acquire land including within their last remaining block, Pākiri No. 1\.
    
    (13) The Crown acknowledges that by around 1900 Ngāti Manuhiri were left virtually landless and that the Crown's failure to ensure that Ngāti Manuhiri retained sufficient land for their present and future needs was a breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi][182] and its principles. This hindered the social, economic, and cultural development of Ngāti Manuhiri as a tribe, undermined the ability of Ngāti Manuhiri to protect and manage their taonga, including te reo Māori, and their wāhi tapu, and to maintain spiritual connections to their ancestral lands. The Crown further acknowledges that this has severely impacted on the well-being of Ngāti Manuhiri today.
    
    (14) The Crown acknowledges that, under land development schemes, many Ngāti Manuhiri owners effectively lost the opportunity to live on and use their land and that partitioning of these lands created uneconomic units and contributed to further land alienation.
    
    (15) The Crown acknowledges the ongoing difficulties Ngāti Manuhiri have experienced managing their few residual lands, including high levels of multiple ownership, problems of access, and the high valuations placed on their coastal lands despite restrictions on their development.

    ###### Apology
    
    (1) The Crown recognises the efforts and struggles of the ancestors of Ngāti Manuhiri in pursuit of their claims for redress and justice and makes this apology to Ngāti Manuhiri, to their ancestors, and to their descendants.
    
    (2) The Crown profoundly regrets its breaches of the [Treaty of Waitangi][182] and its principles which left Ngāti Manuhiri with few landholdings by 1865\. The Crown is deeply sorry for its failure to protect the remaining lands of Ngāti Manuhiri, the loss of which had devastating consequences for the cultural, spiritual, economic, and physical well-being of Ngāti Manuhiri that continue to be felt today.
    
    (3) The Crown unreservedly apologises for not having honoured its obligations to Ngāti Manuhiri under the [Treaty of Waitangi][182]. Through this settlement the Crown seeks to atone for its wrongs and to begin the process of healing. It is the desire of the Crown to build a new relationship with Ngāti Manuhiri based on the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles, so that Ngāti Manuhiri and the Crown can work together to revitalise Ngāti Manuhiri.
