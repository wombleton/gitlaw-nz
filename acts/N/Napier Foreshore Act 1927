An Act to enable the Napier Harbour Board to lease to the Mayor, Councillors, and Burgesses of the Borough of Napier a Piece of Land forming Part of the Sea-beach at Napier and now vested in the said Board, and to enable the Corporation of the said Borough to construct Works upon the said Land and other Part of the said Sea-beach.
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    WHEREAS the land described in Schedule [1][14] hereto forms portion of the sea-beach adjoining the Borough of Napier and is vested in the Napier Harbour Board under and by virtue of The Napier Harbour Board Empowering and Loan Act 1884: And whereas it is desirable, for the purpose of enabling the Corporation of the said borough to improve the said land and to render the same more suitable for the recreation, use, and enjoyment of the inhabitants of the said borough and of persons visiting the said borough, that the said borough should possess a fixed tenure of the said land and should have power to construct works upon the same: And whereas the Napier Harbour Board are desirous of giving such tenure for the period hereinafter mentioned, and for that purpose it is necessary to obtain the authority of Parliament: And whereas another portion of the said sea-beach, being the land described in Schedule [2][15] hereto, has been shown on a certain plan deposited in the Land Transfer Office at Napier as forming part and parcel of a public road in the Borough of Napier known as the Marine Parade, but in fact the said piece of land lies to the seaward or outer side of the sea-wall or parapet forming the seaward boundary of the said Marine Parade and consists of sea-beach only, and has never been formed as a road or used as such, and it is not required for such purpose: And whereas it is doubtful whether the title to the said last-mentioned piece of land is vested in the Corporation, but the said title if not vested in the Corporation is vested in the Crown, and in either case it is desirable that the Corporation should have the powers with respect to such piece of land which are hereby conferred:

BE IT THEREFORE ENACTED by the General Assembly of New Zealand in Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:---
