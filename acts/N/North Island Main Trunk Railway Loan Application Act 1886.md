*   #### Preamble
    
    WHEREAS by The North Island Main Trunk Railway Loan Act 1882, it was provided that the Government should raise a loan not exceeding one million pounds sterling in amount for the construction of the Main Trunk Railway of the Northern Island, and it is expedient to make further provision for limiting the application of the moneys so to be raised:

BE IT THEREFORE ENACTED by the General Assembly of New Zealand in Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

##### 1 Short Title
    
*   The Short Title of this Act is The North Island Main Trunk Railway Loan Application Act 1886\.

##### 2 Definition of the line
    
*   The North Island Main Trunk Railway shall be deemed to be a railway from a point at or near Marton to Te Awamutu, _via_ Murimotu, Taumarunui, and the Ongaruhe River Valley.

##### 3 Loan to be carried to a separate account
    
*   All moneys borrowed under the authority of the said Act shall be carried to a separate account in the Public Works Fund, and shall from time to time be applied to the construction of the said railway, in such amounts and within such periods only as shall be provided by any Act or Acts to be passed by the General Assembly appropriating the said moneys; and it is hereby expressly declared that it shall not be lawful for the Governor to recommend to Parliament the appropriation of any part of the moneys so authorized to be borrowed to any other purpose than the construction of the said railway as defined by this Act.

##### 4 Definition of cost of construction
    
*   The following shall be deemed to be included in the cost of constructing the said railway, to which any money of the said loan shall be deemed to be applicable:---
    
    (1) The costs of determining and surveying the line of the railway.
    
    (2) All other costs incidental to the construction of the railway and approaches thereto.
    
    (3) The cost of rolling-stock and other necessary equipment of the railway.
    
    (4) The cost of acquiring Maori or other land for the use and occupation of the same.

    (6) The cost of raising the loan.
    
    The reference to ""Maori"" was substituted, as from 27 November 1947, for a reference to ""Native"" pursuant to section [2(2)][7] Maori Purposes Act 1947 (1947 No 59).
    
    Subsection (5) was amended, as from 16 September 1889, by section 2 North Island Main Trunk Railway Loan Application Act Amendment Act 1889 (1889 No 33), by substituting the reference to ""two hundred and twenty thousand two hundred and eighty-five pounds"" for the reference to ""one hundred thousand pounds"".
