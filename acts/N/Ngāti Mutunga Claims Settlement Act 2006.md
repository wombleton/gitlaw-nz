*   #### Preamble
    
    ###### Background
    
    (1) The Treaty of Waitangi (te Tiriti o Waitangi), as set out in English and Māori in [Schedule 1][145] of the Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975, was signed in 1840:
    
    (2) Recitals (3) to (28) of this Preamble present, in summary form, the background to the Ngāti Mutunga historical claims, and a summary of the historical account, that are set out in the deed of settlement entered into by Ngāti Mutunga and the Crown:
    
    ###### The rohe of Ngāti Mutunga
    
    (3) According to Ngāti Mutunga, the traditional rohe of Ngāti Mutunga is indelibly etched into both physical and historical landscapes. The Titoki ridge rising from the marine shelf in the northwest signals interface with Ngāti Tama. From here, the Titoki Stream outlines the extremities of tūpuna mana as far north as the Mangahia Stream from which an easterly direction is struck to Huanui, then northeast to Waitara-iti. The rohe then finds a natural eastern definition in the Waitara River as the river flows southward to the Pouiatoa precinct. From here the border extends further south and then northwest along the Waitara River to a point where the river connects with the Makara Stream. The confines of mana whenua are then traced in a northerly direction skirting slightly west of the Poukekewa, Poutotara, and Pukemai Streams. The Mangahewa Stream then provides an outline for the duration of the course to the coast. The old settlement in the district of Te Rau o te Huia was bounded by the Waiau River and its remains mark the area of Ngāti Mutunga's traditional southern boundary:
    
    (4) The area of the Ngāti Mutunga rohe described above was approximately 63 200 hectares (156 000 acres) according to a digital map calculation in 2003:
    
    ###### Taranaki wars
    
    (5) The Crown proclaimed martial law throughout Taranaki on 22 February 1860\. The Taranaki wars of 1860--61 and 1863--69 followed. During the course of the wars, the Crown built redoubts at Urenui, Wai-iti, and Papatiki to secure military occupation of the surrounding land. These redoubts also provided security for military settlements that were established on confiscated land. The Urenui and Wai-iti redoubts were established on Ngāti Mutunga pā sites, with Urenui being one of the principal kāinga of Ngāti Mutunga:
    
    ###### Confiscation
    
    (6) In 1863, the New Zealand Settlements Act 1863 was enacted. This Act provided for the confiscation, by the Crown, of lands of Māori whom the Crown assessed to have been in ""rebellion"" against the authority of the Queen. On 2 September 1865, the Governor declared the confiscation district of ""Ngatiawa"" and designated ""Ngatiawa Coast"" as an eligible site for settlement. The Ngatiawa Coast eligible site took in the entire rohe of Ngāti Mutunga. All of the land of Ngāti Mutunga was confiscated, despite the declaration that land of ""loyal inhabitants"" would be taken only where ""absolutely necessary for the security of the country"":
    
    ###### Compensation Court
    
    (7) A Compensation Court was set up under the New Zealand Settlements Act 1863 to compensate some of those whose lands were confiscated by the Crown. The compensation process and its outcomes added to the uncertainty, distress, and confusion among the people of Ngāti Mutunga as to where they were to live and whether they had security of title. Those considered to be ""rebels"" could not make claims. All of the Compensation Court awards within the rohe of Ngāti Mutunga were based on out-of-court settlements. By the time these were made, most of the readily usable land in the north had already been disposed of by the Crown. These settlements were not properly investigated by the Compensation Court. All of the awards made by the Compensation Court on the basis of these settlements were made to individuals, rather than to hapū. Out of the lands confiscated from Ngāti Mutunga, 9 900 acres were awarded to 87 individuals between Te Rau o te Huia and Titoki. The awards did not reflect customary forms of land tenure and made the land more susceptible to sale. In 1867, the Crown promised an award of 3 000 acres to the absentee owners from Ngāti Mutunga who had taken up residency in Taranaki since the beginning of the Compensation Court hearings. By 1880, the land awarded to the people of Ngāti Mutunga through the compensation process had not been allocated or granted:
    
    ###### Parihaka
    
    (8) Before the wars ended, a movement for peace and independence was established at Parihaka under the leadership of Te Whiti o Rongomai and Tohu Kākahi. In 1878, the Government began surveying the central Taranaki district in which the Parihaka block was located. When the survey neared Māori cultivations, Te Whiti and Tohu introduced a policy of passive resistance to the surveyors and European settlers who followed. Ngāti Mutunga and other iwi supported this policy. These passive resistance campaigns led to more than 420 ""ploughmen"" and 216 ""fencers"" being arrested. Most were denied a trial and many prisoners, including people of Ngāti Mutunga, were held in the South Island. Prison conditions were harsh and included hard labour. The Ngāti Mutunga person Pitiroi Paekaha was among those who died while in custody:
    
    (9) On 5 November 1881, more than 1 500 Crown troops invaded and occupied Parihaka. Over the following days, some 1 600 Māori were forcibly expelled from the settlement and made to return to their previous homes. Houses and cultivations were systematically destroyed, and stock was driven away or killed. Taranaki Māori assert that women were raped and otherwise molested by the soldiers:
    
    (10) The leaders of Parihaka, Te Whiti o Rongomai and Tohu Kākahi, were arrested, and held until 1883\. Special legislation provided for their imprisonment without trial:
    
    ###### West Coast Commissions and West Coast Settlement Reserves
    
    (11) Two West Coast Commissions were appointed in 1880\. The first was established to inquire into the Compensation Court awards and specific promises made by the Crown to Māori in Taranaki concerning confiscated lands. The second was established to implement the recommendations of the first. Almost all of the open coastal land confiscated within the rohe of Ngāti Mutunga had already been allocated to military settlers. Ngāti Mutunga was left with insufficient agricultural land for its present and future needs:
    
    (12) Of the land that was returned to Ngāti Mutunga, all was returned under individualised title. Many of the reserves were protected against permanent alienation when granted, but these restrictions were later removed and much of this land was sold:
    
    (13) The reserves made by the West Coast Commission were vested in the Public Trustee in trust for Māori owners, with Māori thereby losing legal ownership and control of their lands. The Public Trustee had full power to sell or lease the alienable reserves, and lease the inalienable ones under terms imposed by statute. The West Coast Settlement Reserves Act 1892 provided for perpetually renewable leases with rent based on the unimproved value of the land:
    
    (14) In 1926, the Sim Commission was set up to investigate confiscations under the New Zealand Settlements Act 1863 and subsequent legislation. The Commission's recommendations for an annuity of £5,000 for all the Taranaki confiscations and a single payment of £300 for the loss of property at Parihaka were not discussed with the iwi concerned and were never accepted as adequate. For the first 17 years, the payments were irregular. The sums due in the early 1930s were not fully paid:
    
    ###### Public Works acquisitions
    
    (15) The Crown has acquired Ngāti Mutunga land under Public Works legislation, including Okoki Pā and part of Pukemiro Pā. Both sites are wāhi tapu of particular significance to Ngāti Mutunga:
    
    ###### Natural resources
    
    (16) The access of Ngāti Mutunga to rivers, lakes, forests, swamps, and foreshore has been affected by land loss. Much of the land adjacent to waterways is held in private ownership preventing Ngāti Mutunga from maintaining a right of access to its traditional fisheries and other food gathering places:
    
    ###### Ngāti Mutunga makes submissions to the Waitangi Tribunal
    
    (17) The enactment of the Treaty of Waitangi Amendment Act 1985 made it possible for Māori to bring claims before the Waitangi Tribunal in respect of acts or omissions on or after 6 February 1840 by, or on behalf of, the Crown that were inconsistent with the principles of the [Treaty of Waitangi (te Tiriti o Waitangi)][145]:
    
    (18) Between 1990 and 1995, the Waitangi Tribunal investigated 21 claims concerning Taranaki made to the Waitangi Tribunal (the _Taranaki Claims_). The Taranaki Claims included claims of Ngāti Mutunga. A considerable number of submissions and research reports were filed by Taranaki Māori (including Ngāti Mutunga) with the Waitangi Tribunal in relation to the Taranaki Claims:
    
    ###### The Crown's acknowledgements to Waitangi Tribunal
    
    (19) The Crown advised the Waitangi Tribunal, after hearing the claimants' evidence, that it considered there was a basis for negotiation with claimants and that the Crown had invited claimants to meet with it for that purpose. The Crown asked the Waitangi Tribunal to issue an interim report in order to assist the negotiations process between the Crown and claimants (including Ngāti Mutunga):
    
    (20) The Waitangi Tribunal asked the Crown to indicate those matters upon which it would not wish to give evidence before the Tribunal. The Crown provided this advice to the Waitangi Tribunal on 28 November 1995 in its Interim Response (which is Document 2.108 on the Waitangi Tribunal's Record of Inquiry for Taranaki):
    
    (21) The Crown acknowledged to the Waitangi Tribunal in its Interim Response that---
        
    *   (a) the Waitara purchase and the wars that followed constituted an injustice and were, therefore, in breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi (te Tiriti o Waitangi)][145] and its principles; and
    
    *   (b) the confiscation of land, as it occurred in Taranaki, also constituted an injustice and was, therefore, in breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi (te Tiriti o Waitangi)][145] and its principles; and
    
    *   (c) the confiscation had a severe impact upon the welfare, economy, and development of the iwi of Taranaki; and
    
    *   (d) in general terms, the delays in setting aside reserves contributed to the adverse effects of the confiscation; and
    
    *   (e) events relating to the implementation of the confiscation leading to the invasion of Parihaka in 1881, the invasion itself, and its aftermath constituted a breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi (te Tiriti o Waitangi)][145] and its principles:
    
    ###### Interim Taranaki Report of Waitangi Tribunal
    
    (22) In June 1996, the Waitangi Tribunal issued an interim report called the ""Taranaki Report Kaupapa Tuatahi"" (the _Interim Taranaki Report_) giving its preliminary views on the Taranaki Claims:
    
    (23) The Waitangi Tribunal issued the Interim Taranaki Report---
        
    *   (a) based on the Waitangi Tribunal's inquiry up to the date of the report (and noted that the Crown had yet to be heard on many matters raised); and
    
    *   (b) in order to expedite negotiations for a settlement of the Taranaki Claims (including the claims of Ngāti Mutunga):
    
    ###### Views of the Waitangi Tribunal in the Interim Taranaki Report
    
    (24) The Waitangi Tribunal, in the Interim Taranaki Report, expressed some preliminary views concerning the Taranaki Claims including that---
        
    *   (a) ""they could be the largest in the country. There may be no others where as many Treaty breaches had equivalent force and effect over a comparable time"" (section 1.1); and
    
    *   (b) ""we see the claims as standing on 2 major foundations, land deprivation and disempowerment, with the latter being the main. By "'disempowerment'", we mean the denigration and destruction of Māori autonomy or self-government"" (section 1.4); and
    
    *   (c) ""this report has introduced the historical claims of the Taranaki hapū. It has shown the need for a settlement"" (section 12.3.1); and
    
    *   (d) ""generous reparation policies are needed to remove the prejudice to Māori, to restore the honour of the Government, to ensure cultural survival, and to re-establish effective interaction between the Treaty partners"" (section 12.2):
    
    ###### The settlement negotiations with Ngāti Mutunga
    
    (25) The Ngāti Mutunga Iwi Authority received in May 1996 a mandate from Ngāti Mutunga to negotiate a deed of settlement with the Crown. The Crown recognised the mandate of the Ngāti Mutunga Iwi Authority in November 1996:
    
    (26) The Ngāti Mutunga Iwi Authority and the Crown entered into---
        
    *   (a) a terms of negotiation dated 1 July 1997, which specified the scope, objectives, and general procedures for the negotiations; and
    
    *   (b) a heads of agreement dated 24 September 1999 recording that Ngāti Mutunga and the Crown were, in principle, willing to enter into a deed of settlement on the basis of the Crown's settlement proposal set out in the heads of agreement:
    
    (27) Ngāti Mutunga ratified the Crown's final settlement offer and entered into a deed of settlement on 31 July 2005\. The deed records the agreement between Ngāti Mutunga and the Crown to settle the historical claims of Ngāti Mutunga:
    
    ###### Te Rūnanga o Ngāti Mutunga
    
    (28) In July 2005, Ngāti Mutunga ratified a new governance arrangement to succeed the Ngāti Mutunga Iwi Authority. The governance arrangement is a private trust administered by trustees and known as Te Rūnanga o Ngāti Mutunga. Te Rūnanga o Ngāti Mutunga was established by trust deed dated 21 December 2005\.
    
    ##### Kupu Whakataki
    
    (1) I hainatia te Tiriti o Waitangi, tērā e whakatahia ana i roto i te reo Pākēha me te reo Māori i te Wāhanga Tuatahi o [te Ture Tiriti o Waitangi 1975][146], i te tau 1840:

    ###### Te rohe o Ngāti Mutunga
    
    (3) Hei tā ngā kōrero tuku iho o Ngāti Mutunga, kua tāmoua te rohe o Ngāti Mutunga ki ngā tongi whenua, ki ngā tongi kōrero anō hoki. Ki te tongi i Titoki ki tai, tūtata ana ki a Ngāti Tama ki raro rā. Kōkiritia te manga o Titoki, poua whakararo ai te mana o ngā tūpuna ki te paenga ki Te Mangahia, ahu atu ki uta rā ki Huanui, pātuki whakararo te rāwhiti atu ki te whakarua ki Waitara-iti.

    (4) Ko te rohe kua whakatakotohia i runga ake nei, he āhua 63 200 heketea (156 000 eka) tōna rahi, ki te tatauranga a tētehi mapi rorohiko i te tau 2003:
    
    ###### Ngā pakanga o Taranaki
    
    (5) I te 22 o Hui-Tanguru 1860 i whakpuakina te pānui mō te ture taua ki Taranaki e te Karauna. Whai muri mai ko ngā pakanga o Taranaki i ngā tau 1860--61, nawhi nāwhai rā ko te pakanga 1863--69\. I taua wā i whakatūngia e te Karauna ētehi pā tūhāhā ki Urenui, ki Wai-iti me Papatiki kia whakanohoia e ia āna hōia ki te whenua hei tiaki i ngā nohoanga hōia i whakaritea i ngā whenua i murua. I whakatūngia ngā pā tūhāhā o Urenui me Wai-iti i ngā pā o Ngāti Mutunga, ko Urenui tētehi o ngā tino noninga kumu o Ngāti Mutunga:
    
    ###### Muru me te Raupatu Whenua
    
    (6) I te tau 1863 i whakamanangia te Ture Whakatau Manene ki Niu Tireni 1863\. Nā te Ture nei i āhei ai te muru i ngā whenua Māori e tirohia ana e te Karauna ""i mahi hara"" ki te mana o te Kuini. I te 2 o Mahuru i te tau 1865, i whakapuakina e te Kāwana te takiwā muru raupatu ""Ngatiawa"", ā i whakaritea te takiwā ""Takutai o Ngatiawa"" hei wahi whakanoho manene. Ka riro te katoa o te rohe o Ngāti Mutunga i te takiwā ""Takutai o Ngatiawa"". I kaingia katoatia te whenua katoa o Ngāti Mutunga e te muru raupatu ahakoa te whakapuakitanga ka kore te whenua o te ""hunga harakore"" e riro atu, hāunga te wā ""hirahira noa mō te marutanga o te motu"":
    
    ###### Te Kōti Utunga
    
    (7) I whakatūria te Kōti Utunga i raro i te maru o te Ture Whakatau Manene ki Niu Tireni 1863 hei utu i ērā tāngata mō ō rātou whenua i murua e te Karauna. Maranga ake te whakapuna waru ai, te kohuki, te kōripo o te hinengaro i ō te iwi o Ngāti Mutunga, i te mea kāore rātou i mōhio ki hea rātou noho ai, me he purutanga tā rātou ki ngā taitara. Kāore te hunga e meatia nei ""he tangata tautohetohe"" i āhei ki te kawe kerēme. Ko ngā whakawhiwhinga Kōti Utunga katoa i te rohe o Ngāti Mutunga i ara ake i ngā whakataunga i waho ake o te Kōti. Hei te wā kua rite te tuku i ngā utunga kōti, kua hokona kētia te whenua pai kei te raki hei mahinga e te Karauna. Kāore i āta rangahaungia ēnei whakataunga e te Kōti Utunga. I whakahokia ngā whakawhiwhinga katoa a te Kōti Utunga ki te tangata takitahi, āpā te hapū. Mai i ngā whenua i murua i waenganui i Te Rau o te Huia me Titoki i whakahokia te 9 900 eka ki ngā tāngata takitahi e 87\. Kāore i whai wāhi ngā whakawhiwhinga nei ki ngā tikanga tūturu mō te whenua, ā, mōrearea te noho o te whenua, kei hokona. I te tau 1867, i puta te taunaha a te Karauna, ka tukuna e ia te 3 000 eka ki ngā tāngata i hoki mai ki Taranaki i muri mai i te tīmatatanga o te nohoanga tuatahi o te Kōti Utunga. Tae noa ki te tau 1880, kāhore anō ngā whakawhiwhinga ki ngā tāngata o Ngāti Mutunga kia tukuna, kia tohaina rānei:
    
    ###### Parihaka
    
    (8) I mua i te otinga o te pakanga, i taketake mai te kaupapa mō te rongomau me te mana motuhake i Parihaka Taranaki, i raro i te rangatiratanga o ngā manu e rua, o Te Whiti-o-Rongomai rāua ko Tohu Kākahi. I te tau 1878, i tīmata te Kāwanatanga ki te rūri whenua i roto tonu o te takiwā pū o Taranaki. Ko Parihaka tonu kei tērā takiwā. I te wā i tata mai ngā mahi rūri whenua ki ngā māra Māori, i whakaurua mai e Te Whiti rāua ko Tohu te kaupapa maungārongo i runga i a rātou, hei tohu whakautu ki ngā kairūri, ki ngā tāngata whai hoki. Nā Ngāti Mutunga me ētehi atu iwi tēnei kaupapa i tautoko. Nā ēnei kātū mahi maungārongo i mouhere ai ""ngā kaiparau"" e 420 me ""ngā kaiwhakapai taiepa"" e 216\. Kāhore te nuinga o rātou i whakawākia ki te kōti, he tokomaha anō me ngā uri o Ngāti Mutunga i mouhereheretia ki Te Waipounamu. He wāhi kino te wāhi, he karawhiu i ngā tāngata ki ngā mahi mārō, ki ngā mahi whakauaua tangata. Koia i pērā nā ngā kaupēhipēhi ka aituatia a Pitiroi Paekaha tētehi o ngā mouhere nō Ngāti Mutunga i te whareherehere:
    
    (9) I te 5 o Whiringa-ā-rangi 1881, i whakaekea te pā o Parihaka e ngā hōia neke atu i te 1 500 a te Karauna. Ka huri ngā rā, ka panaia ngā Māori 1 600\. Ka whakahaua kia hoki atu ki hō rātou kāinga o mua. Ka turakina ngā whare, ka hokarikaringia ngā māra, ā ka peia atu ngā kararehe, ka patua rānei. E ai ki ngā kōrero a ngā Māori o Taranaki, i paheratia, i rawekengia ngā wāhine e ngā hōia:
    
    (10) Ka mouhereheretia ngā manu e rua o Parihaka, a Te Whiti o Rongomai rāua ko Tohu Kākahi taea noatia ki te tau 1883\. Ka puta tētehi hanganga ture motuhake kia mouheretia rāua, hāunga kē te whakawā:
    
    ###### Ngā Komihana Tai Hauāuru me ngā Whenua Rāhui o Te Tai Hauāuru
    
    (11) E rua ngā Komihana Tai Hauāuru i tohungia i te tau 1880\. Ko te tuatahi i whakaritea ki te tirotiro ki ngā whakawhiwhinga a te Kōti Utunga me ngā kōrero taunaha a te Karauna anō ki ngā Māori o Taranaki e pā ana ki ngā whenua muru. Ko te tuarua i whakaritea ki te whakatutuki i ngā tūtohutanga o te Komihana tuatahi. I taua wā kua riro kē ngā mania i te takutai moana i te rohe o Ngāti Mutunga ki te hunga hōia. Nō reira, kāore i pai te rahi o te whenua i waihotia ki a Ngāti Mutunga hei mahinga māna e ea ai ōna wawata ahuwhenua mō ēnei rangi mō ngā rangi kei te tū:
    
    (12) I raro i te tangata takitahi te whenua i hoki mai ai ki a Ngāti Mutunga. He maha ngā whenua rāhui nei i whakarauhi i te hoko i te wā i tukuna mai, engari nāwhi nā whai rā ka hikina ēnei tōngā, ā, he nui te whenua i hokona:
    
    (13) Ko ngā whenua i rāhuitia e te Kōmihana Tai Hauāuru hei whakahokitanga ki te Māori i tukuna kē ki te Kaitiaki Tūmatanui hei tiaki mā ngā Māori nō rātou aua whenua. Ka ngaro i ngā tāngata nō rātou te whenua te mana whakahaere. Ka riro ki te Kaitiaki Tūmatanui te mana whakahaere ki te hoko, ki te rīhi rānei i ngā whenua rāhui me te rīhi i ngā whenua motuhake i raro i ngā takotoranga i utaina mai e te Ture. I raro i te Ture West Coast Settlement Reserves Act 1881 ka whai wāhi ai ngā rīhi pūmou nā runga i ngā whakahekenga mai o ngā utu mō te reti:
    
    (14) I te tau 1926 i whakatūria Te Komihana Sim hei tirotiro i ngā murunga i raro i te Ture Whakatau Manene ki Niu Tireni 1863 me ngā hanganga ture i whai muri iho. I tūtohungia e te Komihana kia £5,000 te nui hei utu mō ngā muru raupatu katoa o Taranaki me tētehi utunga kia £300 mō te ngaromanga o ngā rawa i Parihaka, kīhai i kōrerorero tahi ki te iwi e tika ana nōna aua take, me he tika hoki te rahi o te utunga. Mō te taha ki te moni ā-tau i ngā tau tīmatatanga 17 he kātū pōraruraru ki te wā hei utunga atu, nā, i ngā tau tōmua o ngā tau 1930 he mea kongakonga noa iho i utua:
    
    ###### Ngā hokonga Public Works
    
    (15) Kua riro i te Karauna ētehi whenua o Ngāti Mutunga mā ngā hanganga ture mahi tūmatanui pēnei i te pā o Okoki me tētehi wāhanga o te pā o Pukemiro. E rua e rua he wāhi tapu, he wāhi whakahirahira ki a Ngāti Mutunga:
    
    ###### Ngā taonga o te taiao
    
    (16) Nā te ngaromanga haere o te whenua kua āraia te haere a Ngāti Mutunga ki ona awa, moana, ngahere, repo me te takutai moana. Kua aukatingia ētehi o ngā whenua i te taha o ngā awa, ā, kua āraia a Ngāti Mutunga i ona tauranga ika, wāhi hī, wāhi kohikohi kai hoki:
    
    ###### Ka whakatakoto a Ngāti Mutunga i āna tāpaetanga kōrero ki mua i te Rōpū Whakamana i te Tiriti o Waitangi
    
    (17) Nā te whakamanatanga o te ture Treaty of Waitangi Amendment Act 1985 i ahei ai a Māori ki te tuku kerēme ki te Rōpū Whakamana i te Tiriti o Waitangi e pā ana ki ngā ture, ki ngā hipanga rānei i mahia e te Karauna, mō te Karauna rānei, i muri iho mai i te 6 o Hui-tanguru 1840\. Koia i anga kē ai ērā whakaritenga a te Karauna i ngā mātāpono o [Te Tiriti o Waitangi][145]:
    
    (18) Mai i te tau 1990 ki te tau 1995 i tirotiro te Rōpū Whakamana i te Tiriti o Waitangi i ngā kerēme e 21 mō Taranaki (ngā _Kerēme o Taranaki_). Ka uru ngā kerēme a Ngāti Mutunga ki aua Kerēme o Taranaki. He tini ngā tāpaetanga me ngā pūrongo rangahau i whakatakotohia e te Māori o Taranaki (ko Ngāti Mutunga hoki i reira) ki mua i te aroaro o te Rōpū Whakamana i te Tiriti o Waitangi e pā ana ki ngā Kerēme o Taranaki:
    
    ###### Ko ngā tukunga whakaae a te Karauna ki te Rōpū Whakamana i te Tiriti o Waitangi
    
    (19) I muri iho i ngā whakaaturanga a ngā kaikerēme i whakamōhio atu te Karauna ki te Rōpū Whakamana i te Tiriti o Waitangi, ki tōna whakaaro e whai take ana te āta noho me te āta whiriwhiri ki ngā kaikerēme, ā, i tono atu te Karauna kia hui rāua tahi ko ngā kaikerēme mō taua take. I tonoa te Rōpū Whakamana i te Tiriti o Waitangi e te Karauna kia whakaraua tētehi rīpoata hei āwhina i te huarahi hanga ritenga i waenga i te Karauna rātou ko ngā kaikerēme (ko Ngāti Mutunga hoki tērā):
    
    (20) I pātai te Rōpū Whakamana i te Tiriti o Waitangi ki te Karauna kia tohungia ngā take kāore i hiahiatia e ia kia huraina ki te aroaro te Rōpū Whakamana i te Tiriti o Waitangi. I tuku te Karauna i aua kōrero whakamārama ki te Rōpū Whakamana i te Tiriti o Waitangi i te 28 o Whiringa-ā-rangi 1995 i roto i tana Whakautu Whāiti (arā, ko te Tuhinga Whaimana 2.108 o te Pūrongo Uiui o Taranaki a te Rōpū Whakamana i te Tiriti o Waitangi):
    
    (21) I tuku whakaae mai te Karauna ki te Rōpū Whakamana i te Tiriti o Waitangi i tōna Whakautu Whāiti---
        
    *   (a) ka noho te hokonga o Waitara, me ngā pakanga i whai muri iho, hei nawe, oti rā he tūkino i te Tiriti o Waitangi me ōna mātāpono; ā
    
    *   (b) he mea tūkino hoki te hanga o te muru whenua i roto i a Taranaki, ko tōna hua tonu he mea tūkino anō i te Tiriti o Waitangi me ōna mātāpono; ā
    
    *   (c) i taimaha tonu te pānga mai o te muru whenua ki te oranga, ki te ōhanga, ki te whanaketanga hoki o ngā iwi o Taranaki; ā
    
    *   (d) i tōna mutunga, nā te takaroanga o te parepare i ngā wāhinga whenua Māori i kino atu ai ngā hua o te muru; oti rā
    
    *   (e) ko ngā āhuatanga i te whakatinanatanga o te muru i horoa ai a Parihaka i te tau 1881, ko taua horonga tonu me ngā huanga o muri iho i tūkinotia ai te Tiriti o Waitangi me ōna mātāpono:
    
    ###### Te Pūrongo Whāiti mō Taranaki a te Rōpū Whakamana i te Tiriti o Waitangi
    
    (22) I te Pipiri, 1996 i tuku te Rōpū Whakamana i te Tiriti o Waitangi i tētehi purongo whāiti e kīia nei ko ""Taranaki Report Kaupapa Tuatahi"" (arā ko te _Pūrongo Whāiti mō Taranaki_) e tāpae ake ana i ōna tirohanga tīmatanga mō ngā Kerēme o Taranaki:
    
    (23) I tuku te Rōpū Whakamana i te Tiriti o Waitangi i taua Pūrongo Whāiti mō Taranaki---
        
    *   (a) i takea mai te wetewete a te Rōpū Whakamana i te Tiriti o Waitangi i ngā kitenga tae atu ki te wā i puta ai te pūrongo (me tōna mōhio hoki, kāore anō kia rangona ngā tāpaetanga a te Karauna); ā
    
    *   (b) hei whakatere i ngā whiriwhiringa kia puta mai tētehi whakataunga o ngā Kerēme o Taranaki (me ngā kerēme o Ngāti Mutunga):
    
    ###### Ngā whakaaro o te Rōpū Whakamana i te Tiriti o Waitangi i roto i te Pūrongo Whāiti mō Taranaki
    
    (24) Ko tā te Rōpū Whakamana i te Tiriti o Waitangi, i roto i taua Pūrongo Whāiti mō Taranaki, he whakapuaki i ngā whakaaro tīmatanga mō ngā Kerēme o Taranaki e mea ana---
        
    *   (a) ""koia pea ngā kerēme rarahi tonu i tēnei whenua. Kāore pea he rohe kē atu i ēnei i whēnei ai te tini o ngā tūkinotanga i te Tiriti o Waitangi, i whēnei hoki i te roa o te wā"" (wāhanga 1.1); ā
    
    *   (b) ""ki tō mātou tirohanga kua rua rawa ngā take matua i ū ai ngā kerēme, koia ko ēnei ko te rironga atu o te whenua, ko te rironga atu o te mana, ā, ko te noho mana kore te mea matua o rāua. Ko te "'rironga atu o te mana'" e hua atu ana ki te whakaitinga, ki te kurukurunga o te mana motuhake, o te tino rangatiratanga rānei"" (wāhanga 1.4); ā
    
    *   (c) ""ko tā tēnei pūrongo, he horanga tuatahi o ngā kerēme a ngā hapū o Taranaki. Kua whakaaturia te akiaki nei, kia whai whakataunga"" (wāhanga 12.3.1); ā
    
    *   (d) ""me whakatū huarahi whai kiko, huarahi hāngai tonu e unuhi ai i ngā hanga tāmi i te Māori, e ara ake anō ai te tūnga o te Kāwanatanga, e ora ai ngā ritenga o te Māori, e pūmou ai ngā hunga whai pānga e rua o te Tiriti"" (wāhanga 12.2):
    
    ###### Ngā whiriwhiringa whakatau taketake me Ngāti Mutunga
    
    (25) I te Haratua o te tau 1996 i whai te Ngāti Mutunga Iwi Authority i te mana whakahaere mai i ngā uri o Ngāti Mutunga kia whiriwhirihia tētehi whakatau taketake ki te Karauna. I aro atu te Karauna ki te mana whakahaere o te Ngāti Mutunga Iwi Authority i te marama o Whiringa-ā-rangi 1996:
    
    (26) Ka anga tahi te Ngāti Mutunga Iwi Authority me te Karauna ki roto i---
        
    *   (a) tētehi tātai whiriwhiringa i te 1 o Hōngongoi 1997 i tohua te tirohanga whānui, ngā whāinga me ngā tukunga whakahaere mō aua whiriwhiringa rā; ā
    
    *   (b) tētehi whakatūnga whakaaetanga i te 24 o Mahuru 1999 e whakatakoto ana i te whakaaro o te Ngāti Mutunga Iwi Authority me te Karauna, i tōna mutunga, kia whāia he whakatau taketake i runga i te tukunga i whakatakotoria ai e te Karauna ki te whakatūnga whakaaetanga:
    
    (27) I whakamana te iwi o Ngāti Mutunga i te whakataunga whakamutunga rawa o te Karauna, ā, kātahi ka tāmokongia te whakatau taketake i te 31 o Hōngongoi 2005\. He mea whakapurongo tā te whakatau taketake i te whakaaetanga i waenganui i a Ngāti Mutunga me te Karauna hei whakatau i ngā kerēme o nehe o Ngāti Mutunga:
    
    ###### Te Rūnanga o Ngāti Mutunga
    
    (28) I te Hōngongoi 2005 i whakamana a Ngāti Mutunga i te rūnanga hou ka whai atu i te Ngāti Mutunga Iwi Authority. He tarahi motuhake te rūnanga hou ka whakahaerehia e ngā kaitiaki. Ko Te Rūnanga o Ngāti Mutunga tōna ingoa. I whakatūria ai te Rūnanga o Ngāti Mutunga e tōna tuhinga whaimana tarahi i te 21 o Hakihea 2005\.

##### 6 Acknowledgements and apology
    
*   [Sections 7 to 10][10] record the acknowledgements and the apology given by the Crown to Ngāti Mutunga in the deed of settlement.

##### 7 Text of acknowledgements in English
    
*   The text of the acknowledgements in English as set out in the deed of settlement is as follows:
    
    (1) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) the cumulative effect of the Crown's actions in purchasing land in Taranaki created tensions that led to the outbreak of war; and
    
    *   (b) the wars in Taranaki constituted an injustice and were in breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi (te Tiriti o Waitangi)][145] and its principles.
    
    (2) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) Ngāti Mutunga as an iwi was not in rebellion and was unfairly treated as being in rebellion; and
    
    *   (b) Ngāti Mutunga was deprived of the lands and resources within its rohe, and as a result was unable to exercise rangatiratanga over them; and
    
    *   (c) the confiscation was indiscriminate in extent and application and had a devastating effect on the welfare, economy, and social and economic development of Ngāti Mutunga in Taranaki; and
    
    *   (d) the confiscation deprived Ngāti Mutunga of access to its traditional sources of food and other resources associated with that confiscated land; and
    
    *   (e) the confiscation was unjust and unconscionable and in breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi (te Tiriti o Waitangi)][145] and its principles.
    
    (3) The Crown recognises that the lands and other resources confiscated from Ngāti Mutunga have made a significant contribution to the wealth and development of New Zealand.
    
    (4) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) the prejudicial effect of the confiscation was compounded by the inadequacies in the Compensation Court process that included long delays in the promised return of land to Ngāti Mutunga individuals; and
    
    *   (b) the Compensation Court awarded land to individuals rather than iwi or hapū, which was not consistent with customary tenure. This system was imposed on Ngāti Mutunga and its views were not sought.
    
    (5) The Crown acknowledges that the treatment of those Ngāti Mutunga and other Māori of Taranaki imprisoned and exiled as a result of the passive resistance campaign from 1879 to 1880 deprived these British subjects of their basic human rights, inflicted unwarranted hardships on them and their whānau and hapū, and was a breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi (te Tiriti o Waitangi)][145] and its principles.
    
    (6) The Crown acknowledges---
        
    *   (a) the serious damage it inflicted on the prosperous Māori village of Parihaka and the people residing there, its forcible dispersal of many of the inhabitants, and its assault on the human rights of the people; and
    
    *   (b) that these actions caused great distress and were a complete denial of the Māori right to develop and sustain autonomous communities in a peaceful manner; and
    
    *   (c) that its treatment of the Ngāti Mutunga people at Parihaka was unconscionable and unjust and that these actions constituted a breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi (te Tiriti o Waitangi)][145] and its principles.
    
    (7) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) the West Coast Commissions were inadequate in their scope and therefore did not fully address the injustices perpetrated by the confiscation; and
    
    *   (b) the reserves created by the Commissions in the 1880s were not sufficient for the present and future needs of Ngāti Mutunga; and
    
    *   (c) some reserves created by the Commissions on the basis of entitlements outside the Ngāti Mutunga rohe were allocated within the Ngāti Mutunga rohe; and
    
    *   (d) the Crown's actions with respect to the West Coast Settlement Reserves, considered cumulatively (including the imposition of a regime of perpetually renewable leases and the sale of large quantities of land by the Public and Māori Trustee)---
            
        *   (i) ultimately deprived Ngāti Mutunga of the control and ownership of the lands reserved for it in Taranaki; and
        
        *   (ii) were in breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi (te Tiriti o Waitangi)][145] and its principles.
        
        
    
    (8) The Crown acknowledges that despite previous efforts made in the twentieth century, including those of the Sim Commission, it has failed to deal in an appropriate way with the grievances of Ngāti Mutunga. In particular, the payments made under the Taranaki Māori Claims Settlement Act 1944 did not sufficiently address the grievances of Ngāti Mutunga.
    
    (9) The Crown recognises the efforts and struggles of Ngāti Mutunga in pursuit of its claims for redress and compensation against the Crown for over 130 years.
    
    (10) The Crown acknowledges that the cumulative effect of its breaches of the [Treaty of Waitangi (te Tiriti o Waitangi)][145] and its principles has significantly undermined the traditional systems of authority, economic capacity and the physical, cultural and spiritual wellbeing of Ngāti Mutunga. The Crown acknowledges that it has failed to protect the rangatiratanga of Ngāti Mutunga in breach of its obligations under Article Two of the Treaty of Waitangi (te Tiriti o Waitangi).
