When the DBP contributors scheme is wound up, the interests of all members in that scheme at that time shall be transferred to the DBP annuitants scheme immediately before the DBP annuitants scheme is wound up.
    
    (2) Upon a winding up of the DBP annuitants scheme, the Crown shall pay into that scheme the amount necessary to increase the market value of the property of that scheme to the value it would have had if---

*   (1) To the extent that the terms of the DBP annuitants scheme and DBP contributors scheme may permit improvements or other changes in benefits (including in each case increases to benefits of either or both such schemes but not including transfers to other superannuation schemes) then, without limiting considerations other than the financial position that may be taken into account, any person (including the Board and the Crown) shall either---
        
    *   (a) take into account the combined financial position of the DBP annuitants scheme and the DBP contributors scheme as if---

        *   (iii) all property and liabilities of the Board that existed immediately before the transfer day in relation to an NPF group company had been allocated among the existing schemes by the proposal in a fair and equitable manner; and
        
        *   (iv) the investment of the property of those schemes had been appropriate to their liabilities; and
        
        *   (v) all powers, directions, actions, and obligations had been exercised, made, taken, or complied with as if subparagraphs (i) to (iv) had applied; or
        
        
    
    *   (b) take into account only the financial position of the DBP contributors scheme.
    
    (2) In the event that a change in benefits is implemented under subclause (1)(a), there shall be a transfer between the DBP contributors scheme and the DBP annuitants scheme of such property as is necessary to ensure that the resulting financial position of each scheme is fair and equitable to the members and other beneficiaries of the scheme, the corporate contributors, and the Crown as guarantor.
    
    (3) In the event that a change in benefits under the DBP annuitants scheme is implemented under subclause (1)(b), there shall be a transfer from the DBP contributors scheme to the DBP annuitants scheme of property having a market value equal to the consequential increase in the actuarial liability of the DBP annuitants scheme.
    
    (4) Any person (including the Board and the Crown) considering, determining, or directing a change in benefits in terms of subclause (1)---
        
    *   (a) shall, in deciding which of the paragraphs (a) and (b) of subclause (1) to apply, take into account the position which is most favourable to members and other beneficiaries of the DBP contributors scheme and DBP annuitants scheme; and
    
    *   (b) shall regard as the paramount objective the need to ensure that members and other beneficiaries of the DBP annuitants scheme are not in any way disadvantaged by the implementation of any settlement of claims in relation to any NPF group company; and
    
    *   (c) shall have regard to the practice of not improving benefits from a superannuation scheme unless there is an actuarial surplus in that scheme.
    
    (5) To the extent that the terms of the DBP contributors scheme and DBP annuitants scheme provide for the payment of any amounts on transfer of a member or other beneficiary to another superannuation scheme (**transfer values**) then, without limiting any existing rights of any members or other beneficiaries or the considerations other than the financial position that may be taken into account, any person (including the Board and the Crown) considering, determining, or directing any matter in respect of transfer values shall take into account the combined financial position of the DBP annuitants scheme and DBP contributors scheme as if subparagraphs (i) to (v) of subclause (1)(a) applied.
    
    (6) Following the payment of any transfer values determined in accordance with subclause (5), there shall be a transfer between the DBP contributors scheme and DBP annuitants scheme of such property as is necessary to ensure that the resulting financial position of each scheme is fair and equitable to the members and other beneficiaries of the scheme, the corporate contributors, and the Crown as guarantor.
    
    (7) Any person (including the Board and the Crown) considering, determining, or directing any matter in respect of transfer values in terms of subclause (5) shall have as an objective the need to ensure that members and other beneficiaries of the DBP contributors scheme and DBP annuitants scheme are not in any way---
        
    *   (a) affected by the division resulting in those schemes; or
    
    *   (b) disadvantaged by the implementation of any settlement of claims in relation to any NPF group company.

*   Upon any member of the DBP contributors scheme ceasing to be a contributor but retaining a right, actual or contingent, to a benefit, the Board as trustee of the DBP contributors scheme shall transfer to the DBP annuitants scheme property having a market value equal to the liability of the DBP annuitants scheme to pay the benefit attributable to that person's membership, taking into account estimates of future investment earnings, taxation, inflation, and mortality rates, that are based on reasonable expectations over the appropriate term of the liability in respect of that benefit assuming that the scheme is fully funded with an asset mix based on the investments that a trustee would make in respect of the scheme if fully funded taking into account the term and nature of its liabilities.
    
    Schedule 5 clause 3: amended, on 7 November 1991, by [section 14(4)][216] of the National Provident Fund Restructuring Amendment Act 1991 (1991 No 114).

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the National Provident Fund Restructuring Act 1990\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 May 2011, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][237] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][238] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][239] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][240] and [17E][241] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
