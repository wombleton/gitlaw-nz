*   #### Preamble
    
    WHEREAS James Wilfred Marsden, deceased, late of Stoke, in the Provincial District of Nelson, by his last will and testament devised the lands described in the [Schedule][6] hereto, together with the buildings thereon, unto the Nelson Diocesan Trust Board (Incorporated) upon trust as and for the permanent residence of the Bishop of the Diocese of Nelson and his successors in office for all time, and with and subject to certain directions, powers, and provisions therein set out: And whereas it was in the said will and testament provided that the said Board should have no power to sell, mortgage, or alienate any part or parts of the said lands and premises: And whereas by reason of the unsuitability of the locality of the said lands and the buildings thereon for a residence of the said Bishop and his successors the terms of the trust cannot be given effect to: And whereas it is desirable that the terms of the trust should as nearly as may be be given effect to by the sale of the said lands and the application of the net proceeds of such sale in and towards purchasing a residence for the said Bishop and his successors: And whereas the powers requisite to enable the said Board to sell such lands are attainable only by legislation:

BE IT THEREFORE ENACTED by the General Assembly of New Zealand in Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:---
