#### Summary of historical account, acknowledgements, apology of the Crown, and summary of settlement background

##### 7 Summary of historical account, acknowledgements, apology, and summary of settlement background
    
*   (1) [Section 8][10] summarises the historical account from the deed of settlement, setting out the background to the deed of settlement as agreed by the Crown and Ngāti Rangiteaorere.
    
    (2) [Sections 9][11] and [10][12] record the text of the acknowledgements and apology given by the Crown to Ngāti Rangiteaorere in the deed of settlement.
    
    (3) The acknowledgements and apology are to be read together with the historical account recorded in part 3 of the deed of settlement.
    
    (4) [Section 11][13] summarises the partial settlement that took place between the Crown and Ngāti Rangiteaorere before the deed of settlement.

##### 8 Summary of historical account
    
*   (1) Ngāti Rangiteaorere is an iwi of the Te Arawa confederation of tribes, based on the eastern shores of Lake Rotorua. They also share interests with other iwi on Mokoia Island and in coastal lands near Maketu. Although Ngāti Rangiteaorere did not sign the Treaty of Waitangi, from the 1840s to the early 1860s, they sought to work with the Crown in the administration of their district. During this time, Māori customary law largely continued to prevail in the Ngāti Rangiteaorere rohe.
    
    (2) Ngāti Rangiteaorere were drawn into the New Zealand wars from the mid-1860s. Those Ngāti Rangiteaorere who supported the Crown during the wars did so at considerable cost to themselves.
    
    (3) Ngāti Rangiteaorere held all their lands under customary tenure when the native laws of the 1860s came into force. However, the Native Land Court was not designed to accommodate the complex and fluid customary land usages of Māori as it assigned permanent ownership to a clearly defined area of land. The Crown hoped that the application of the native land laws would eventually lead Ngāti Rangiteaorere and other Māori to abandon the collective structures of their traditional landholdings. The title determination process also carried significant costs for Ngāti Rangiteaorere and other Māori. Ngāti Rangiteaorere had no alternative but to use the court if they wished to secure legal title to their lands.
    
    (4) In 1882, the Native Land Court investigated the ownership of the Whakapoungakau block and awarded most of it to members of Ngāti Rangiteaorere and a neighbouring iwi. In 1900 the Native Land Court awarded the Crown 348 acres from Whakapoungakau 2 to 7 and 17 in lieu of survey costs. The individualised interests thus acquired by the Crown were spread across the Whakapoungakau subdivisions, but the Crown persuaded Ngāti Rangiteaorere to allow the Crown's awards to form 1 contiguous parcel of land. The land awarded to the Crown was flat, fertile, and easily accessible by road. The land that remained with Ngāti Rangiteaorere was fragmented, and much of it was steep and inaccessible.
    
    (5) Ngāti Rangiteaorere have always highly valued the Tikitere geothermal field for medicinal, spiritual, and economic purposes. In 1953, the Crown acquired, without the consent of Ngāti Rangiteaorere, the sole right to regulate the use of geothermal energy resources when the Geothermal Energy Act 1953 was enacted. Ngāti Rangiteaorere considers that the Crown had no authority to overrule the mana of Ngāti Rangiteaorere in the Tikitere geothermal field.
    
    (6) In the early 1970s, the Crown proposed a land swap to extend the Lake Okataina Scenic Reserve. This involved the exchange of land in Whakapoungakau which Ngāti Rangiteaorere had significant ancestral connections with for land in which they had no such connections. As a result of this exchange Ngāti Rangiteaorere were alienated from Whakapoungakau maunga, one of their most sacred sites.

##### 9 Acknowledgements
    
*   (1) The Crown acknowledges that it has failed to address until now the long-standing, deeply-felt grievances of Ngāti Rangiteaorere. For Ngāti Rangiteaorere the road to settlement has been a long and challenging one. The Crown hereby recognises the legitimacy of their grievances and makes the following acknowledgements.
    
    (2) The Crown acknowledges that, in the 1860s, Ngāti Rangiteaorere were drawn into wars that were not of their making. Those Ngāti Rangiteaorere who supported the Crown during the wars did so at considerable cost to themselves.
    
    (3) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) it introduced the native land laws without consulting with Ngāti Rangiteaorere and the individualisation of title provided for by the native land laws was inconsistent with tikanga Ngāti Rangiteaorere; and
    
    *   (b) some key Crown goals in introducing the native land laws were to make the lands of Ngāti Rangiteaorere and other iwi available for European settlement, and eventually to detribalise Māori, including Ngāti Rangiteaorere, and assimilate them to European culture; and
    
    *   (c) Ngāti Rangiteaorere were required to engage with the Native Land Court if they wanted to participate in the modern economy and the court's processes had a disruptive effect on Ngāti Rangiteaorere and carried significant costs for them which contributed to the alienation of land; and
    
    *   (d) the individualised titles awarded by the court made the lands of Ngāti Rangiteaorere, including Whakapoungakau, more susceptible to partition, fragmentation, and alienation and this contributed to the erosion of the traditional social structures, mana, and rangatiratanga of Ngāti Rangiteaorere. The Crown acknowledges it failed to take adequate steps to protect these structures, and this was a breach of Te Tiriti o Waitangi/the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles.
    
    (4) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) Ngāti Rangiteaorere sought to retain tribal authority over their lands but the Crown failed to provide an effective form of corporate title until 1894; and
    
    *   (b) by 1894 the great bulk of Ngāti Rangiteaorere lands, including Whakapoungakau, had passed through the Native Land Court and were held under individualised title; and
    
    *   (c) the Crown's failure to provide an effective means in the native land legislation for the collective administration of Ngāti Rangiteaorere lands before 1894 was a breach of Te Tiriti o Waitangi/the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles.
    
    (5) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) it acquired from Ngāti Rangiteaorere much of the most valuable land in the Whakapoungakau block in lieu of survey costs; and
    
    *   (b) the land remaining with Ngāti Rangiteaorere was fragmented, and much of it was therefore inaccessible.
    
    (6) The Crown acknowledges that Ngāti Rangiteaorere consider---
        
    *   (a) the Tikitere geothermal resource to be a taonga; and
    
    *   (b) that the Geothermal Energy Act 1953 failed to recognise their mana over this taonga.
    
    (7) The Crown acknowledges the distress caused to Ngāti Rangiteaorere by the extension of the Lake Okataina Scenic Reserve in the early 1970s. This involved the exchange of land in which many Ngāti Rangiteaorere had significant ancestral connections for land in which they had no such connections. The Crown acknowledges that as a result of this exchange Ngāti Rangiteaorere were alienated from Whakapoungakau maunga, one of their most sacred sites.

##### 10 Apology
    
*   (1) To the iwi of Ngāti Rangiteaorere, to the tūpuna and the descendants, the Crown now makes this apology.
    
    (2) The Crown recognises that while Ngāti Rangiteaorere has consistently honoured their responsibilities under the Treaty of Waitangi, the Crown has not lived up to its Treaty obligations to Ngāti Rangiteaorere. For this, the Crown is deeply sorry.
    
    (3) The Crown accepts that Ngāti Rangiteaorere wished to retain long-established tribal authority over their lands and resources, but, from the 1860s, the Crown introduced native land laws which worked directly against this objective and undermined the mana and the rangatiratanga of Ngāti Rangiteaorere. For this, the Crown unreservedly apologises to Ngāti Rangiteaorere.
    
    (4) Through the native land laws, the actions of Crown purchase agents, and the extension of the Lake Okataina Scenic Reserve, the Crown facilitated the estrangement of Ngāti Rangiteaorere from some of the most cherished parts of their rohe, including their sacred maunga, Whakapoungakau. The Crown profoundly regrets the loss and the trauma Ngāti Rangiteaorere thereby experienced.
    
    (5) The Crown now seeks to forge a new relationship with the people of Ngāti Rangiteaorere. The Crown sincerely hopes that this relationship will be based on mutual trust and co-operation, and grounded in respect for the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles.

##### 11 Summary of settlement background
    
*   (1) On 21 October 1993, representatives of Ngāti Rangiteaorere and the Crown entered into a final agreement (the _Agreement_) between the Minister of Justice on behalf of the Crown and the Trustees of Ngāti Rangiteaorere for and on behalf of the people of Ngāti Rangiteaorere in relation to Claim Wai 32\.
    
    (2) The Agreement noted how the transfer of the Te Ngae Mission Farm and an adjoining 59.5 acres had been achieved. The Anglican Church and Ngāti Rangiteaorere signed an agreement in December 1991 under which the trustees appointed by the Church for the Te Ngae Mission Farm Trust resigned and were replaced by trustees appointed by Ngāti Rangiteaorere. The Agreement also noted that the Church gave the Te Ngae Mission Farm Trust the title and ownership of an additional 59.5-acre block of land adjoining the Te Ngae Mission Farm.
    
    (3) The Crown also made an _ex gratia_ payment of $760,000 under clause 7 of the Agreement.
    
    (4) In conjunction with the Agreement, the Crown introduced and Parliament enacted [section 13][129] of the Reserves and Other Lands Disposal Act 1993, which authorised the registered proprietor of the Te Ngae Mission Farm and associated land to transfer all or part of that land to the eponymous ancestor of Ngāti Rangiteaorere. The transfers occurred in 1994\. The land has since been vested in the trustees of the Te Ngae Farm Trust.
    
    (5) Recent decisions of the Māori Land Court \[62 Waiariki MB 92\] and the Māori Appellate Court \[2013 MAC MB 127\] confirmed the assets of the Te Ngae Farm Trust are held on trust for the hapū Ngāti Rangiteaorere.
    
    (6) Between 26 April and 27 May 2013, members of Ngāti Rangiteaorere voted on a resolution that the proceeds of the Agreement and the redress provided under the deed of settlement be managed by the trustees of the Ngāti Rangiteaorere Koromatua Council. Sixty-five percent of valid votes cast were in favour of the resolution. The trustees of the Ngāti Rangiteaorere Koromatua Council have advised the Crown they will consider options to consolidate or otherwise align the management of the proceeds of the Agreement and the redress provided under the deed of settlement.
    
    (7) The Agreement was a partial settlement of Ngāti Rangiteaorere's historical claims. The Crown and Ngāti Rangiteaorere agree that the redress from the Agreement and the redress provided under the deed of settlement and this Act comprise the comprehensive settlement of Ngāti Rangiteaorere's historical claims.
