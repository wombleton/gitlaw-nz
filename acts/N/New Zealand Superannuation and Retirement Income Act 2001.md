    (2A) The adjustments (by any percentage movement upwards in the CPI) required under subsection (2) as at 1 April in any year from 2011 to 2017 (inclusive) must, despite subsections (1) and (2), be calculated,---

    *   (a) so that the weekly amounts referred to in [section 16][23] are set in accordance with that section; and
    
    *   (b) so that the rate of New Zealand superannuation stated in paragraph (b) of clause 2 of [Schedule 1][124] preserves its proportional relationship (after the deduction of standard tax) to the rates stated in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of clause 1 of that schedule.
