    (4) [Section 11][13] pardons Kereopa Te Rau for his role in the death of Reverend Volkner.

##### 8 Summary of historical account
    
*   (1) Ngāti Rangiwewehi did not sign the [Treaty of Waitangi][182], but from the 1840s they embraced new economic opportunities made possible by European settlement and sought to work with the Crown in the administration of their district. In the 1850s, the Ngāti Rangiwewehi leader Wiremu Maihi Te Rangikaheke gave manuscripts he had written to Governor George Grey. These writings made a significant contribution to the influential books Grey later wrote on Māori culture, but Grey's publications make no acknowledgement of the contribution of Te Rangikaheke.
    
    (2) As the Kīngitanga movement developed in the late 1850s, some Ngāti Rangiwewehi chose to align with the Māori King. When the Crown sent troops to Tauranga in 1864, members of Ngāti Rangiwewehi went to Tauranga to assist their traditional allies. In April 1864, they were among the warriors who inflicted a heavy defeat on the British troops at Gate Pā. In June 1864, Crown forces defeated Kīngitanga Māori at Te Ranga, killing 17 Ngāti Rangiwewehi individuals.
    
    (3) The Crown regarded Māori who fought at Gate Pā and Te Ranga as rebels. Between 1865 and 1868, the Crown confiscated 290 000 acres of land around Tauranga, including land in which Ngāti Rangiwewehi had interests. The Crown announced it would retain 50 000 acres and the remainder would be returned to Māori. However, all customary interests in the returned lands were compulsorily extinguished.
    
    (4) Kereopa Te Rau was a member of Ngāti Rangiwewehi. In 1864, during the Waikato war, his wife and daughter were killed by Crown forces. In the Eastern Bay of Plenty, in 1865, a group of Māori killed a missionary who had previously sent the Crown a plan of the pā where Kereopa's whānau were killed. In 1871, Kereopa was convicted of the murder and sentenced to death. Ngāti Rangiwewehi maintains that Kereopa did not receive a fair trial and was wrongfully executed.
    
    (5) In the 1860s, the Crown introduced native land laws, which established the Native Land Court and tasked it with converting customary title into title derived from the Crown. Customary tenure generally accommodated multiple interests, but the new land laws gave rights to individuals. Ngāti Rangiwewehi had no alternative but to use the court if they wished to secure legal title to their lands and participate in the new economy. In the 1870s, Ngāti Rangiwewehi leaders criticised the native land laws and called, without success, for tribal control of land and resources.
    
    (6) In 1880, Ngāti Rangiwewehi rangatira were among the Māori signatories to an agreement made with the Crown to establish a township at Rotorua. Ngāti Rangiwewehi reasonably expected they would benefit from this agreement after a committee of local chiefs concluded they had interests in the township block. However, these expectations were not met as the Native Land Court did not award Ngāti Rangiwewehi any interests in this block.
    
    (7) Between 1887 and 1908, the Crown acquired approximately 65% of the land awarded to Ngāti Rangiwewehi by the Native Land Court. This land included some of the most valuable and prized parts of the Ngāti Rangiwewehi rohe. In the 1890s, the Crown purchased individualised shares in the Mangorewa Kaharoa block in the core Ngāti Rangiwewehi rohe before the block had been partitioned and the specific holdings of hapū and whānau had been defined. In 1896, the Crown applied to have its interests in the block defined and was awarded roughly a third of the block, including the most valuable land in the block and freshwater springs near Hamurana, which are taonga for Ngāti Rangiwewehi.
    
    (8) In 1966, a piece of land at Taniwha Springs was compulsorily acquired from Ngāti Rangiwewehi by a local authority for waterworks purposes. The block contains springs that are central to Ngāti Rangiwewehi traditions and identity as an iwi. A pump station was built over the springs, where it remains today. The local authority had previously sought an alternative source of water from the Crown, but the Crown refused to make it available. Ngāti Rangiwewehi have mourned the loss of their taonga since its taking.

##### 9 Acknowledgements
    
*   (1) The Crown acknowledges that it has failed to address until now the long-standing grievances of Ngāti Rangiwewehi. The Crown hereby recognises the legitimacy of the grievances of Ngāti Rangiwewehi, and makes the following acknowledgements.
    
    ###### War
    
    (2) The Crown acknowledges that,---
        
    *   (a) in the 1860s, Ngāti Rangiwewehi were drawn into wars that were not of their making. These conflicts had a divisive effect as individuals and hapū within Ngāti Rangiwewehi were compelled to align themselves with different sides in the conflict; and
    
    *   (b) the Crown caused deep suffering to Kereopa Te Rau in February 1864, when members of his whānau were killed during an assault by Crown forces on the Waikato village of Rangiaowhia.
    
    (3) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) members of Ngāti Rangiwewehi were attacked by Crown forces at Pukehinahina in April 1864, and at Te Ranga, in June 1864, 17 Ngāti Rangiwewehi warriors were killed, including Kaingarara, one of their leading rangatira; and 
    
    *   (b) the Crown was ultimately responsible for the outbreak of war in Tauranga in 1864 and the resulting loss of life, and thus breached Te Tiriti o Waitangi/the [Treaty of Waitangi][182] and its principles.
    
    ###### Tauranga raupatu/confiscation
    
    (4) The Crown acknowledges that its 1868 extension of the Tauranga confiscation boundary compulsorily extinguished any customary interests in the enlarged confiscation district, including those of Ngāti Rangiwewehi. This was a breach of Te Tiriti o Waitangi/the [Treaty of Waitangi][182] and its principles. The Crown further acknowledges that after the confiscation land was returned to Ngāti Rangiwewehi in the form of individualised title rather than Māori customary title.
    
    ###### Te Rangikaheke and his writings
    
    (5) The Crown acknowledges that,---
        
    *   (a) through his writings, Wiremu Maihi Te Rangikaheke contributed significantly to the influential books published by Sir George Grey on Māori culture and tradition; and
    
    *   (b) Grey, in his publications, made no reference to the contribution of Te Rangikaheke.
    
    ###### Native land laws
    
    (6) The Crown acknowledges that the workings of the native land laws, in particular in the awarding of land to individuals rather than iwi or hapū and the enabling of individuals to deal with that land without reference to iwi or hapū,---
        
    *   (a) made the lands of Ngāti Rangiwewehi more susceptible to alienation and facilitated the Crown's acquisition of taonga such as Hamurana Springs against the wishes of Ngāti Rangiwewehi; and
    
    *   (b) eroded the traditional social structures, mana, and rangatiratanga of Ngāti Rangiwewehi. The Crown acknowledges it failed to take adequate steps to protect these structures, and that this was a breach of Te Tiriti o Waitangi/the [Treaty of Waitangi][182] and its principles.
    
    (7) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) Ngāti Rangiwewehi sought, through leaders like Wiremu Hikairo and Wiremu Maihi Te Rangikaheke, to retain tribal authority over their lands, but the Crown failed to provide an effective form of corporate title until 1894; and
    
    *   (b) by 1894 the great bulk of Ngāti Rangiwewehi lands, including the Mangorewa Kaharoa and Maraeroa Oturoa blocks, had passed through the Native Land Court and were held under individualised title; and 
    
    *   (c) the Crown's failure to provide an effective means in the native land legislation for the collective administration of Ngāti Rangiwewehi lands before 1894 was a breach of Te Tiriti o Waitangi/the [Treaty of Waitangi][182] and its principles.
    
    ###### Fenton Agreement
    
    (8) The Crown acknowledges Ngāti Rangiwewehi rangatira were among the signatories to the Fenton Agreement in 1880\. The Crown also acknowledges that the Komiti Nui o Rotorua considered Ngāti Rangiwewehi to have interests within the Pukeroa Oruawhata block. However, these interests were not recognised by the Native Land Court when it delivered its judgment in 1881\. The Crown acknowledges that a strong grievance arises for Ngāti Rangiwewehi from this decision.
    
    ###### Crown land purchasing
    
    (9) The Crown acknowledges the strongly felt grievances of Ngāti Rangiwewehi arising from the following methods by which the Crown purchased land in which they had interests:
        
    *   (a) opening negotiations with other iwi for the Paengaroa North block before the Native Land Court had determined that Ngāti Rangiwewehi had interests in the block:
    
    *   (b) buying individual interests from non-resident Ngāti Rangiwewehi owners of the Mangorewa Kaharoa block before those interests had been defined, despite protests from those residing on the land:
    
    *   (c) seeking an award of the most valuable and culturally significant land in the block in return for the individual interests purchased in Mangorewa Kaharoa, despite claims from the sellers and the non-sellers that they had agreed that the Crown would acquire other land in the block, and despite the fact the Crown had not acquired a majority of shares in the block.
    
    ###### Taniwha Springs
    
    (10) The Crown acknowledges that Taniwha Springs/Pekehāua Puna Reserve is a sacred taonga to Ngāti Rangiwewehi and is central to Ngāti Rangiwewehi traditions and identity as an iwi. The Crown also acknowledges that,---
        
    *   (a) in 1966, land at Taniwha Springs was taken by a local authority for water supply purposes:
    
    *   (b) before taking the land at Taniwha Springs, the local authority sought an alternative water supply from the Crown but the Crown refused to make the water available:
    
    *   (c) in refusing to make the alternative water supply available to the local authority, the Crown was aware the local authority would in all likelihood have to take water from Taniwha Springs instead.
    
    (11) The Crown further acknowledges that the taking of the land at Taniwha Springs and the subsequent abstraction of water had a severe impact on Ngāti Rangiwewehi and are strongly felt by Ngāti Rangiwewehi to be the greatest grievances they bear against the Crown.

##### 10 Apology
    
*   (1) The Crown hereby makes this apology to Ngāti Rangiwewehi, the people who descend from Tawakeheimoa and his son, Rangiwewehi.
    
    (2) For too many years, the Crown has failed to respond to your grievances in an appropriate way. The task of pursuing justice for the Crown's wrongs has been the work of generations of Ngāti Rangiwewehi. The Crown now recognises a solemn duty to apologise to you for its failure to honour its obligations to Ngāti Rangiwewehi under Te Tiriti o Waitangi/the [Treaty of Waitangi][182] and its principles.
    
    (3) In the 1850s, the bond between the great Ngāti Rangiwewehi leader Wiremu Maihi Te Rangikaheke and Governor George Grey was characterised by goodwill, respect, and co-operation. It was a partnership that should have set a tone for the overall relationship between Ngāti Rangiwewehi and the Crown, but history took a different, unhappy course.
    
    (4) Ngāti Rangiwewehi were drawn into, and divided by, the wars of the 1860s. Ngāti Rangiwewehi warriors died fighting against the Crown at Te Ranga in 1864\. Through the Tauranga raupatu, the Crown extinguished customary title in Ngāti Rangiwewehi lands without the consent of Ngāti Rangiwewehi.
    
    (5) Time and again Ngāti Rangiwewehi sought to retain tribal authority over their lands, but the native land laws introduced by the Crown worked directly against their wishes and against their rangatiratanga. These laws, and the actions of Crown purchase agents, facilitated the loss of much of the rohe of Ngāti Rangiwewehi, including Hamurana Springs, one of the great treasures of Ngāti Rangiwewehi.
    
    (6) Through all these travails, Ngāti Rangiwewehi kept hold of another cherished taonga, Pekehāua Puna. Yet, in 1966, this too was taken from them. The Crown regrets deeply the trauma and anguish this loss caused for Ngāti Rangiwewehi.
    
    (7) Over the generations, the Crown's breaches of the Treaty compromised your social and traditional structures, your autonomy, and your ability to exercise your customary rights and your responsibilities. With great sorrow, the Crown apologises for its actions and for the impact they had on the individuals, whānau, and hapū of Ngāti Rangiwewehi.
    
    (8) A better future beckons. Through this apology, and this settlement, the Crown turns its face towards that future and hopes to establish a new relationship with Ngāti Rangiwewehi based on mutual trust, co-operation, and respect for Te Tiriti o Waitangi/the [Treaty of Waitangi][182] and its principles.

##### 11 Pardon
    
*   (1) [Sections 8][10] and [9][11] and the historical account in the deed of settlement record the circumstances of Kereopa Te Rau's involvement in the murder of Reverend Carl Sylvius Volkner.
    
    (2) Kereopa Te Rau is pardoned for his role in the death of Reverend Volkner.
