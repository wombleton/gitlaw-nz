    Section 2(2): sections 54 and 55 brought into force, on 8 February 2013, by the [Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei Claims Settlement Act Commencement Order 2013][140] (SR 2013/3).

## Part 1  
Preliminary provisions and settlement of historical claims

##### 3 Purpose
    
*   The purpose of this Act is to give effect to certain provisions of the deed of settlement, which is a deed that settles the historical claims of Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei.

##### 4 Act binds the Crown
    
*   This Act binds the Crown.

##### 5 Outline
    
*   (1) This section is a guide to the overall scheme and effect of this Act. It does not affect the interpretation or application of the other provisions of this Act or the deed of settlement.
    
    (2) This Part---
        
    *   (a) sets out the purpose of this Act and specifies that it binds the Crown; and
    
    *   (b) records the acknowledgements and the apology given by the Crown in the deed of settlement; and
    
    *   (c) sets out the timing of actions or matters occurring or taking effect under this Act; and
    
    *   (d) defines terms used in this Act, including key terms such as Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei and historical claims; and
    
    *   (e) provides that the settlement of the historical claims is final; and
    
    *   (f) provides for the effect of the settlement on the jurisdiction of a court, tribunal, or other judicial body in respect of the historical claims; and
    
    *   (g) provides for a consequential amendment to the [Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975][141] and removes the application of certain other statutory provisions; and
    
    *   (h) provides for the effect of the settlement on certain memorials recorded on land registers; and
    
    *   (i) provides to the trustee of the Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei Trust a mandate for negotiating outstanding claims; and
    
    *   (j) preserves the right of Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei to participate in certain proceedings before the Waitangi Tribunal; and
    
    *   (k) preserves the right of the Crown to provide redress to other persons; and
    
    *   (l) provides for the exclusion of the law against perpetuities; and
    
    *   (m) provides for access to the deed of settlement.
    
    (3) [Part 2][27] provides for the following cultural redress:
        
    *   (a) the issuing of protocols to the trustee of the Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei Trust by the Minister of Conservation, the Minister of Energy and Resources, and the Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage; and
    
    *   (b) a statutory acknowledgement by the Crown of the statement made by Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei of their cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional associations with certain land (the statutory area, as defined in [section 28(2)][36]); and
    
    *   (c) the vesting of the Pourewa Creek site in the trustee of the Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei Trust; and

    (5) [Part 4][70] relates to the Ōrākei Block (as described in [Schedule 3][137]). Parliament has previously partly addressed Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei grievances in relation to this block through the enactment of the Orakei Block (Vesting and Use) Act 1978 and the [Orakei Act 1991][142]. Those Acts---
        
    *   (a) provided for the recognition of rights secured to Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei in relation to the Ōrākei Block by the [Treaty of Waitangi][141]; and
    
    *   (b) gave effect to parts of an agreement reached between the Crown and Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei to implement, with modifications, certain of the recommendations made by the Waitangi Tribunal in November 1987 in the _Report of the Waitangi Tribunal on the Orakei Claim_ (Wai 9); and
    
    *   (c) established the Ngati Whatua of Orakei Maori Trust Board and continued it under the name of the Ngati Whatua o Orakei Maori Trust Board (the **Board**); and
    
    *   (d) provided for the revesting of further portions of the Ōrākei Block in the Board, and for the extension of the Board's functions and powers; and
    
    *   (e) provided for the setting aside of certain other land as reserves, and their administration jointly by the Auckland City Council and the Board; and
    
    *   (f) protected land vested in the Board by imposing certain restrictions on the disposal of the land; and
    
    *   (g) granted exemptions to the Board in relation to the payment of rates, reserves contributions, land tax, and other charges.
    
    (6) [Part 4][70] builds on the settlements reached in those earlier Acts by carrying over those matters of continuing relevance (either with or without amendment) and specifying the powers to be exercised and the functions to be performed by Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei in relation to the Ōrākei Block.
    
    (7) [Part 5][97] provides for transitional provisions, consequential amendments, and other similar matters, including the dissolution of certain Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei governance entities, the transfer of their assets and liabilities to the trustee of the Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei Trust, and the repeal of the [Orakei Act 1991][142].

    ###### Ngā Whakaaetanga
    
    (1) E whakaae ana te Karauna, mai anō i te tau 1840 i whai a Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei ki te whakatū hononga me te Karauna me tā rātou huri ki te whakakaha i tēnei hononga mā te whakawhiti whenua mō ngā nohanga te take. I whai wāhi ēnei whenua ki te whanaketanga o Aotearoa, tae noa ki te whanaketanga o Tāmaki Makaurau. Ka whakaae anō hoki te Karauna, i rapu a Ngāti Whātua ki te whakakaha i te hononga nei mā te whakaputa i tōna ngākau pono ki te Karauna.
    
    (2) E whakaae ana te Karauna, kāore i puta ngā hua me te whakamarumarutanga i ngā wā katoa, e ai ki tērā i mana nei e Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei ka riro ki a rātou, nā runga i te hononga.
    
    (3) E whakaae ana te Karauna, mai i te tau 1840, nui tonu ngā whenua ō Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei i wehea, i whakawhiti whenua hoki mā te whakatahanga a te Karauna i tōna mana hoko whenua, tae noa ki ngā tangohanga ""whenua tuwhene"" a te Karauna. He takahitanga o te [Tiriti o Waitangi][141] me ōna mātāpono te kore eke a te Karauna ki te tiaki i ngā whenua, me te hoatu he rawa matua, kia rawaka tonu, hei whakamahi, hei huanga hoki mā Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei mō ngā rā kei te tū.
    
    (4) E whakaae ana te Karauna, kua kāwetoweto te āheitanga o Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei ki te whakahaere i tōna mana motuhake, nā runga i ngā mahi whakawehe i ngā hapū ō Ngāti Whātua i ōna whenua.
    
    (5) E whakaae ana te Karauna, kāore i tika te whakahāngai a te Karauna i ētahi ture i te wā o te whakatahanga whakawāteatanga, hei tiaki i ngā pānga Māori.
    
    (6) E whakaae ana te Karauna, takarepa ana ngā mahi ki te tiaki tika i ngā pā, i ngā urupā hoki, tae noa ki a Maungakiekie, tētahi wāhi tāpua o nehe ā-wairua hoki, i te wā o te whakatahanga whakawāteatanga ā, he takahitanga o te [Tiriti o Waitangi][141] me ōna mātāpono tēnei hapa ki te tiaki kia tika.
    
    (7) E whakaae ana te Karauna, he takahitanga o te [Tiriti o Waitangi][141] me ōna mātāpono tōna kore nganā ki te tāpui (ki te hoatu ki tētahi poari, komiti rānei hei tautiaki) i te hautekau o ngā whenua i whakawhitia i te wā o te whakatahanga whakawāteatanga, hei whakamahi i ngā rā kei te tū, hei hua motuhake rānei mā ngā hunga taketake o taua whenua me ō rātou uri whakatupu ā Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei.
    
    (8) E whakaae ana te Karauna, he takahitanga o te [Tiriti o Waitangi][141] me ōna mātāpono tōna kaupapahere tango ""Whenua Tuwhene"" mai i ngā hokona whakatahanga whakawateatanga i whakakorea, nā tōna hē ki te kore whakarite i tētahi rautaki ki te aromatawai kia rawaka te pupuri a Ngāti Whātua i ētahi whenua mā rātou ake. Ka whakaae anō hoki te Karauna, i kaha ake te hē nā runga i ngā tōrōkiri i roto i te āhua whakatinana a te Karauna i te kaupapahere, he takahitanga anō o te Tiriti o Waitangi me ōna mātāpono.
    
    (9) E whakaae ana te Karauna, i puta he momo whakamau ki a Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei, ā, whakamau tonu nei i ēnei rangi, i ngā mahi whakawhenua anō, me ētahi atu momo mahi whanaketanga ki ngā whanga o Waitematā me Manuka i pā ai te kino ki runga i ngā taunga ika me ētahi atu rawa o ngā whanga nei.
    
    ###### Acknowledgements
    
    (10) The Crown acknowledges that Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei endeavoured to establish a relationship with the Crown from 1840 and sought to strengthen this relationship, in part, by transferring lands for settlement purposes. These lands have contributed to the development of New Zealand and Auckland in particular. The Crown also acknowledges that Ngāti Whātua sought to strengthen the relationship by expressing loyalty to the Crown.
    
    (11) The Crown acknowledges that the benefits and protection that Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei expected to flow from its relationship with the Crown were not always realised.
    
    (12) The Crown acknowledges that a large amount of Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei land was alienated from 1840 by way of Crown purchase and pre-emption waiver transactions, including the acquisition of ""surplus lands"" by the Crown. The Crown's failure to protect lands and provide adequate endowments for the future use or benefit of Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei was a breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi][141] and its principles.
    
    (13) The Crown acknowledges that land alienation has diminished the ability of Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei to exercise mana whenua.
    
    (14) The Crown acknowledges that certain regulations to protect Māori interests in the pre-emption waiver period were not applied correctly by the Crown.
    
    (15) The Crown acknowledges that inadequate protections were applied to pā and urupā in the pre-emption waiver period, including Maungakiekie, a site of historical and spiritual significance to Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei, and that this failure of active protection was a breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi][141] and its principles.
    
    (16) The Crown acknowledges that its failure to set aside (entrusted to a board or committee) one-tenth of the lands transferred during the pre-emption waiver period for the future use or special benefit of the original owners of that land and their descendants (including Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei) was a breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi][141] and its principles.
    
    (17) The Crown acknowledges that its policy of taking ""surplus lands"" from disallowed pre-emption waiver purchases breached the [Treaty of Waitangi][141] and its principles when it failed to ensure any assessment of whether Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei retained adequate lands for their needs. The Crown also acknowledges that this failure was compounded by flaws in the way the Crown implemented the policy in further breach of the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles.
    
    (18) The Crown acknowledges that reclamations and other forms of development of the Waitematā and Manukau Harbours, which had a damaging effect upon fisheries and other harbour resources, caused a sense of grievance for Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei that is still held today.

##### 7 Text of apology
    
*   The text of the Crown's apology set out in the deed of settlement is set out in the following subsections:
    
    ###### Whakapāha
    
    (1) Ka tuku whakapāha te Karauna ki a Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei, ki ō rātou tūpuna, me ō rātou uri whakatupu.
    
    (2) E aro ana te Karauna, mai i te tau 1840 i whai a Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei i tētahi hononga tata, pai hoki, ki te taha o te Karauna, ā, mā te mahi whakawhiti whenua me ētahi atu huarahi, i tuku whenua rātou hei nohanga kāinga Pākehā.
    
    (3) E tino āwhiti ana, e kaha pouri ana hoki te Karauna mō āna mahi tango whenua, i tata whenua kore ai a Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei i te tau 1855\. Ka kino kē ngā putanga o te noho whenua kore kua puta ake mō te oranga pāpori, oranga ōhanga me te oranga wairua ō Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei, ā, e rangona tonutia ana te pānga o aua pehitanga i ēnei rangi.
    
    (4) E tino whakapāha ana te Karauna mō tana kore whakahōnore i ōna here ki a Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei i raro i te [Tiriti o Waitangi][141]. Mā tēnei whakataunga, e hiahia ana te Karauna ki te whakahāngai ēnei hara ōna, inā rā te taea i nāianei, me tana tīmata i te hohau te rongo. E rika ana te Karauna ki te whakapai i tōna hononga me Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei i runga i te ngākau whakawhirinaki, mahi ngātahi, me te aro tuturu mō te Tiriti o Waitangi me ōna mātāpono.
    
    ###### Apology
    
    (5) The Crown makes this apology to Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei and to their ancestors and descendants.
    
    (6) The Crown recognises that from 1840, Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei sought a close and positive relationship with the Crown and, through land transactions and other means, provided lands for European settlement.

    (2) Instruments are binding on, and enforceable by, against, or in favour of, the trustee as if the instruments had been entered into by, made with, given to or by, or addressed to or by, the trustee and not the Statutory Trust Board or the Charitable Trust Board.

    (3) For the purposes of subsection (2), the instrument need not be an instrument of transfer, but must---

*   For the purposes of any enactment, rule of law, determination, contract, or agreement relating to the employment of a transferred employee, the transfer of the person's employment from the Statutory Trust Board or the Charitable Trust Board to the trustee does not, of itself, break the employment of that person, and the period of his or her employment by the Statutory Trust Board or the Charitable Trust Board is to be regarded as having been a period of service with the trustee.

##### 92 No compensation for technical redundancy
    
*   A transferred employee is not entitled to receive any payment or any other benefit solely on the ground that---
