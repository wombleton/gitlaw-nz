    And whereas each of the said companies is a trustee company under and within the meaning of the [Trustee Companies Act 1967][31] and each carries on the business of a trustee company:

    And whereas as a consequence of the said merger it is desirable to amalgamate the trustee company, trust, and agency businesses of The New Zealand Insurance Company Limited and The South British Guardian Trust Company Limited and for this purpose a private company has been incorporated under the Companies Act 1955 named The New Zealand Guardian Trust Company Limited, all the shares in which have been subscribed for and issued to, or to a nominee of, The New Zealand South British Group Limited:
    
    And whereas The New Zealand Insurance Company Limited, The South British Guardian Trust Company Limited, and The New Zealand Guardian Trust Company Limited have agreed to the transfer to The New Zealand Guardian Trust Company Limited of the said trustee company, trust, and agency businesses of The New Zealand Insurance Company Limited and The South British Guardian Trust Company Limited subject to the passing of this Act and in accordance with the terms thereof:
    
    And whereas it is expedient to authorise and facilitate the said amalgamation:
    
    And whereas legislation is the only means by which---
        
    *   (a) the vesting in The New Zealand Guardian Trust Company Limited of all appointments of The New Zealand Insurance Company Limited or The South British Guardian Trust Company Limited and their respective rights and duties as executor, trustee, or fiduciary in any other capacity; and
    
    *   (b) the empowering of The New Zealand Guardian Trust Company Limited to act as executor of the will and as administrator of the estate of any deceased person; and
    
    *   (c) the inclusion of The New Zealand Guardian Trust Company Limited as a trustee company under the [Trustee Companies Act 1967][31]; and
    
    *   (d) the amalgamation of the said trustee company, trust, and agency businesses (including trust assets and liabilities thereof) of The New Zealand Insurance Company Limited and The South British Guardian Trust Company Limited by the transfer thereof to, and vesting thereof in, The New Zealand Guardian Trust Company Limited; and
    
    *   (e) the transfer of the undertakings of The South British Guardian Trust Company Limited and of the trust department of The New Zealand Insurance Company Limited---
    
    can be effected or effected efficiently and economically and without interference with the conduct and continuity of the said trustee company, trust, and agency businesses in the interests of the said companies, the trusts under administration, their clients, and other persons having business with them: 
    
    And whereas the objects of this Act cannot be attained without the authority of Parliament.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the New Zealand Guardian Trust Company Act 1982\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 22 February 2008, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][55] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][56] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][57] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][58] and [17E][59] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
