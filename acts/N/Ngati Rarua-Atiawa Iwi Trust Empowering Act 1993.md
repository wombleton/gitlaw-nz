An Act to give effect to a resolution by the Nelson Diocesan Synod of the Anglican Church to vest the assets of the Whakarewa School Trust Board in a trust for the descendants of the original Maori owners from whom the said assets were acquired and to make consequential provisions to enable the dissolution of the Whakarewa School Trust Board
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    Whereas---
        
    *   (a) certain land described in [Schedule 1][19] was purported to be the subject of Crown grants dated 25 July 1853 and 4 August 1853, containing respectively 660 acres or thereabouts, and 418 acres 10 perches or thereabouts, such grants having been made to the then Bishop of New Zealand of the Anglican Church for the purposes of establishing a school for the education of children of all races and of children of other poor and destitute persons, being inhabitants of islands in the Pacific Ocean, and for the support of that school so long as religious education, industrial training, and instruction in the English language was given to the youth educated at that school:
    
    *   (b) no school has ever been erected on the said land but a school has operated intermittently supported by income earned from the said land, and no such school has operated at all since last century:
    
    *   (c) the Whakarewa School Trust Board is an Anglican Church Trust incorporated in 1907 under the Religious, Charitable, and Educational Trust Boards Incorporation Act 1884 with the spelling of Wakarewa School Trust Board and administers (pursuant to the terms of the trusts established by the said Crown grants dated 25 July 1853 and 4 August 1853) the original land assets, particularly located at Whakarewa, but also other land assets and bequests acquired by the Anglican Church or the Whakarewa School Trust Board subsequent to the said grants in the Nelson and Motueka districts:
    
    *   (d) the Synod of the Diocese of Nelson of The Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia accepts that, particularly having regard to the principles embodied in the [Treaty of Waitangi][23], it is now just and desirable to vest the land and certain other assets derived from the land in a charitable trust for the benefit of the descendants of the original Maori owners of the said land:
    
    *   (e) the original owners were established by Land Commissioner Spain in 1845 to be members of the Ngati Rarua and Te Atiawa manawhenua ki Motueka iwi and the full names of the then Maori owners were in judgments of the Maori Land Court delivered in 1892 and 1893 as set forth in [Schedule 2][20]:
    
    *   (f) the descendants of the said original owners desire that the terms of the charitable trust to be created should be broader than the trust objects contained in the [Anglican Church Trusts Act 1981][24]:
    
    *   (g) there is no power to alter the objects of the said trust to a wider extent than those contained in the [Anglican Church Trusts Act 1981][24] and it is impracticable and inexpedient for the trustees to apply to the High Court of New Zealand for a variation of the objects of the trust as aforesaid:
    
    *   (h) there is no power in terms of the [Anglican Church Trusts Act 1981][24] for a scheme of arrangement to provide for a transfer of the other significant assets as distinct from the land only of the Whakarewa School Trust Board to a trust to be known as the Ngati Rarua-Atiawa Iwi Trust as set forth in [Schedule 3][21] for the benefit of the descendants of the original Maori owners:
    
    *   (i) there are funds available to or held by the Whakarewa School Trust Board as referred to in [Schedule 4][22], which funds were given to the Whakarewa School Trust Board after 1853 and are separate and distinct from the land and other assets to be vested in the new trust for the descendants of the original owners, and further it is desired to vest such funds in the Nelson Diocesan Trust Board for charitable purposes:
    
    *   (j) it is desired to dissolve the Whakarewa School Trust Board consequent upon the passing of this Act:
    
    *   (k) the objects of this Act cannot be attained otherwise than by legislation.
    
    

Be it therefore enacted by the Parliament of New Zealand as follows:

##### 1 Short Title and commencement
    
*   (1) This Act may be cited as the Ngati Rarua-Atiawa Iwi Trust Empowering Act 1993\.

(b)The first secretary shall be ROBERT PETER SHORE and he shall preside at the inaugural meeting of the Board to enable election of the Chairman under clause 13(e) of this Deed.

#### Distributions

15\.(a)Without it being a binding Trust upon the Trustees it is recorded that the intent of this Deed is that annual profits shall be revealed to all beneficiaries at the Annual General Meeting. The Board shall recommend to the Annual General Meeting the percentage of such profits to be allocated to distributions to the respective iwi for the purposes set forth in clauses 3, 4 and 5 hereof and no vote by the beneficiaries of such profit allocation shall exceed the percentage recommended by the Board.

(b)Any distribution of funds made for the purposes of clauses 3, 4 and 5 hereof shall be made on such a basis that there is a division in value terms as follows as between the iwi involved:  
Ngati Rarua---80%  
Te Atiawa manawhenua ki Motueka---20%

(c)At the Annual General Meeting the board shall report in detail to the beneficiaries the purpose of any grants made for the purposes of clauses 3, 4 and 5 or any other purposes contained in this Deed provided that the names of individual recipients of grants need not be disclosed in circumstances where the grants are for the relief of poverty, indigence or distress and it would cause embarrassment (in the Trustee's view) to the recipients for their names to be so reported to the Annual General Meeting.

(d)No beneficiary or person associated with a beneficiary of the trust shall derive any income, benefit or advantage from the trust where they can materially influence the payment of the income, benefit or advantage except where that income, benefit or advantage is derived from:

i.Professional services to the trust rendered in the course of business charged at no greater rate than current market rates; or

ii.Interest on money lent at no greater rate than current market rates.

#### The Seal
    
*   16\. The Board shall provide for the safe custody of the Trust Seal which will only be used by the authority of the Board and every instrument to which the said seal is affixed shall be signed by two members.

#### Audit
    
*   17\. The accounts of the Board shall be audited by a Chartered Accountant who shall not be a member of the Board and who shall be appointed annually by the Board or by a majority of members of the Board. A duly audited Balance Sheet shall be submitted to the annual meeting. The financial year of the Board shall end as at 31st day of December in each year.

#### Alterations and additions to rules
    
*   18\. These rules may be altered or added to at any meeting of the beneficiaries subject to the following conditions:
        
    *   (a) That any such alteration or addition cannot be inconsistent with the provisions of Section 61 of the Charitable Trusts Act 1957 or any amendments thereto and nor shall any of such alteration or addition in any way detract from the charitable character of the Trust.
    
    *   (b) That three-quarters in number of the beneficiaries present and voting at a Special General Meeting shall be required to pass any such alteration or addition.
    
    

#### Dissolution and disposal of funds

19\.(a)The Trust may be wound up voluntarily by the passing of a resolution of beneficiaries to that effect. Such a resolution shall be passed by a majority of three-quarters of the beneficiaries present and entitled to vote at a Special General Meeting. Such a resolution must provide that after meeting all liabilities any monies or property remaining will be applied towards a charity or some charitable purpose approved as a charity by the Inland Revenue Department in New Zealand as a charity in terms of the Income Tax Legislation for the time being in force.

(b)In the event of such voluntary winding up aforesaid, all monies and property remaining after the due settlement of all the affairs of the Trust and all debts and claims shall be applied towards such charitable purpose or purposes as are set out in subclause (a) of this clause.

In witness whereof these presents have been executed the day and year first hereinbefore written.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Ngati Rarua-Atiawa Iwi Trust Empowering Act 1993\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 29 September 1993, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][29] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][30] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][31] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][32] and [17E][33] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
