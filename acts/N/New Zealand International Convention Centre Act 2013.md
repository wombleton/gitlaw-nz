Accordingly, these references will be automatically adjusted in the event that the amount in that definition or the applicable threshold changes, for alignment with the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism Act 2009 and the regulations made under that Act.

The Secretary may, with the written consent of SKYCITY, adjust the ticket thresholds and denominations in this Schedule 13 to take account of circumstances that exist from time to time.

Nothing precludes the TITO or cashless technology being used interchangeably between different game types.
