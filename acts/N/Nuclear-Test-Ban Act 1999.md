**The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty**

## Preamble

The States Parties to this Treaty (hereinafter referred to as ""the States Parties""),

_Welcoming_ the international agreements and other positive measures of recent years in the field of nuclear disarmament, including reductions in arsenals of nuclear weapons, as well as in the field of the prevention of nuclear proliferation in all its aspects,

_Underlining_ the importance of the full and prompt implementation of such agreements and measures,

_Convinced_ that the present international situation provides an opportunity to take further effective measures towards nuclear disarmament and against the proliferation of nuclear weapons in all its aspects, and _declaring_ their intention to take such measures,

_Stressing_ therefore the need for continued systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally, with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons, and of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control,

_Recognizing_ that the cessation of all nuclear weapon test explosions and all other nuclear explosions, by constraining the development and qualitative improvement of nuclear weapons and ending the development of advanced new types of nuclear weapons, constitutes an effective measure of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation in all its aspects,

_Further_ recognizing that an end to all such nuclear explosions will thus constitute a meaningful step in the realization of a systematic process to achieve nuclear disarmament,

_Convinced_ that the most effective way to achieve an end to nuclear testing is through the conclusion of a universal and internationally and effectively verifiable comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty, which has long been one of the highest priority objectives of the international community in the field of disarmament and non-proliferation,

_Noting_ the aspirations expressed by the Parties to the 1963 Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and Under Water to seek to achieve the discontinuance of all test explosions of nuclear weapons for all time,

_Noting also_ the views expressed that this Treaty could contribute to the protection of the environment,

_Affirming_ the purpose of attracting the adherence of all States to this Treaty and its objective to contribute effectively to the prevention of the proliferation of nuclear weapons in all its aspects, to the process of nuclear disarmament and therefore to the enhancement of international peace and security,

*   1\.Pursuant to Article IV, paragraph 68, each State Party shall, on a voluntary basis, provide the Technical Secretariat with notification of any chemical explosion using 300 tonnes or greater of TNT-equivalent blasting material detonated as a single explosion anywhere on its territory, or at any place under its jurisdiction or control. If possible, such notification shall be provided in advance. Such notification shall include details on location, time, quantity and type of explosive used, as well as on the configuration and intended purpose of the blast.
*   2\.Each State Party shall, on a voluntary basis, as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Treaty provide to the Technical Secretariat, and at annual intervals thereafter update, information related to its national use of all other chemical explosions greater than 300 tonnes TNT-equivalent. In particular, the State Party shall seek to advise:
        
    *   (a)The geographic locations of sites where the explosions originate;
    *   (b)The nature of activities producing them and the general profile and frequency of such explosions;
    *   (c)Any other relevant detail, if available;
    
    and to assist the Technical Secretariat in clarifying the origins of any such event detected by the International Monitoring System.
*   3\.A State Party may, on a voluntary and mutually-acceptable basis, invite representatives of the Technical Secretariat or of other States Parties to visit sites within its territory referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2\.
*   4\.For the purpose of calibrating the International Monitoring System, States Parties may liaise with the Technical Secretariat to carry out chemical calibration explosions or to provide relevant information on chemical explosions planned for other purposes.

## Annex 2 to the Protocol  
List of characterization parameters for International Data Centre standard event screening
    
*   1\.The International Data Centre standard event screening criteria shall be based on the standard event characterization parameters determined during the combined processing of data from all the monitoring technologies in the International Monitoring System. Standard event screening shall make use of both global and supplementary screening criteria to take account of regional variations where applicable.
*   2\.For events detected by the International Monitoring System seismic component, the following parameters, _inter alia_, may be used:
        
    *   -location of the event;
    *   -depth of the event;
    *   -ratio of the magnitude of surface waves to body waves;
    *   -signal frequency content;
    *   -spectral ratios of phases;
    *   -spectral scalloping;
    *   -first motion of the P-wave;
    *   -focal mechanism; relative excitation of seismic phases;
    *   -comparative measures to other events and groups of events;
    *   -and regional discriminants where applicable.
    
*   3\.For events detected by the International Monitoring System hydroacoustic component, the following parameters, _inter alia_, may be used:
        
    *   -signal frequency content including corner frequency, wide-band energy and mean centre frequency and bandwidth;
    *   -frequency-dependent duration of signals;
    *   -spectral ratio; and
    *   -indications of bubble-pulse signals and bubble-pulse delay.
    
*   4\.For events detected by the International Monitoring System infrasound component, the following parameters, _inter alia_, may be used:
        
    *   -signal frequency content and dispersion;
    *   -signal duration; and
    *   -peak amplitude.
    
*   5\.For events detected by the International Monitoring System radionuclide component, the following parameters, _inter alia_, may be used:
        
    *   -concentration of background natural and man-made radionuclides;
    *   -concentration of specific fission and activation products outside normal observations; and
    *   -ratios of one specific fission and activation product to another.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Nuclear-Test-Ban Act 1999\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 October 2008, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that have yet to come into force or that contain relevant transitional or savings provisions are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order.

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][93] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][94] and [17E][95] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
