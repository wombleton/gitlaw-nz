An Act to enable the Napier Harbour Board to sell certain areas of land, and to adjust the boundaries and contour, both external and internal, of the Ahuriri Lagoon
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    Whereas it is expedient that the Napier Harbour Board (hereinafter referred to as the _Board_) should have power to sell certain areas of land in order to provide funds to improve and render saleable those areas and to render revenue-producing certain other areas of land:
    
    And whereas the earthquake which occurred in Hawke's Bay on 3 February 1931 had the effect of raising the level of the bottom of the Ahuriri Lagoon (being an endowment reserved and set aside for the use, benefit, and endowment of, and vested in, the Board by the Napier Harbour Board Act 1874, as amended by the [Napier Harbour Board Amendment and Endowment Improvement Act 1887][12], which last-mentioned Act is hereinafter referred to as the _1887 Act_), thereby reclaiming from the sea large areas of the said lagoon, and confusing the boundaries, both external and internal, thereof:
    
    And whereas the description of the Ahuriri Lagoon as set out in [Schedule 2][13] of the 1887 Act excludes certain islands lying within the outside boundaries of the lagoon, called therein Roro-o-kuri, Parapara, Te Ihuotikei, Uruwiri, Poroporo, Tirowhangahe, Tuteranuku, Awa-a-waka, and Matawhero respectively, of which all except Roro-o-kuri (now owned by Europeans) and Te Ihuotikei and Parapara (both now owned by the Napier Borough Council, the Hastings Borough Council, and the Hawke's Bay County Council) are Maori land the title to which has never been investigated, ascertained, or determined:
    
    And whereas it is expedient in the interests of the Board that the Board should be afforded the facilities and possess the powers by this Act given and conferred in relation to the Ahuriri Lagoon and the islands lying within the outside boundaries thereof as aforesaid.
    
    Preamble: amended, on 27 November 1947, pursuant to [section 2][14] of the Maori Purposes Act 1947 (1947 No 59).

*   The Board shall have power to sell by public auction or public tender, in such parcels, upon such terms and conditions as to payment of the purchase price, security for unpaid purchase moneys, and otherwise, as it shall think fit, portions, limited as hereinafter provided, of the said area of 28 acres, and of the said area of 92 acres, and to apply the purchase moneys arising from any such sale, in or towards the costs and expenses of surveying, subdividing, levelling, roading, draining, and otherwise improving and rendering revenue-producing the said area of 28 acres and the said area of 92 acres, or either of them, including the costs and expenses appertaining to the rendering saleable to the best advantage of the portions of the said areas respectively to which the power of sale hereby conferred shall apply:
    
    provided always and it is hereby declared as follows:
        
    *   (a) the power of sale hereby conferred upon the Board shall not apply to more than one-third of the total area, exclusive of roads, of each of the said areas of 28 acres and 92 acres respectively; but no purchaser from the Board shall be concerned to see or inquire as to whether the Board has exceeded the limit aforesaid, nor shall his title be invalidated or impeached by reason of the Board having exceeded such limit, nor shall he be bound to see or inquire as to the application of his purchase moneys, or be responsible for the misapplication thereof; and a recital in any instrument of alienation executed by the Board in favour of a purchaser that such instrument is entered into under the authority of this Act shall be conclusive evidence for the purposes of such instrument that the Board is acting within the limits of the authority hereby conferred:
    
    *   (b) if the Board shall offer any of the lands to which this section applies for sale by public auction or public tender it shall publish in some newspaper circulating in the towns of Napier and Hastings once at least not less than 30 days before the day appointed for the auction, or before the last day appointed for making a tender, as the case may be, and twice at least after such first publication and before the day so appointed, a notice setting out sufficient particulars of the land proposed to be offered for sale, and of the terms for payment of the purchase moneys:
    
    *   (c) it shall not be necessary in any such sale by public auction or public tender for the Board to accept the highest or any bid or tender:
    
    *   (d) notwithstanding anything in this section, land that has been offered for sale as aforesaid and not sold may at any time within 12 months after the day of the auction, or after the last day for the delivery of tenders for the same, as the case may be, be sold by private contract at a price not less than the upset price at which the land was so offered, and upon terms and conditions as to payment of the purchase price, security for unpaid purchase moneys, and otherwise, coinciding with the original terms and conditions in these respects, or differing therefrom, as the Board shall decide:
        
        provided always that nothing shall prevent the Board from again offering the said land for sale by public auction or public tender in manner hereinbefore provided before the expiration of the said period of 12 months conditionally on such offer not being made at an earlier date than 3 months after the last preceding abortive attempt to effect a sale in that way, and these provisions shall continue to apply notwithstanding any previous abortive attempts to sell by public auction or public tender:
    
    *   (e) if there shall be any surplus moneys arising from sales of land hereby authorised after completion of the purposes for which the power of sale is hereby conferred upon the Board, the same may be applied by the Board in or towards payment of purchase moneys, compensation, costs, charges, and expenses incurred in, or incidental to, the carrying-out of the powers hereinafter conferred upon the Board in relation to the Ahuriri Lagoon; and if there shall still be an ultimate surplus the same shall be applied by the Board in or towards payment of the principal moneys owing by the Board in respect of any loan obtained on the security of, inter alia, the said area of 28 acres and the said area of 92 acres under the authority of the [Napier Harbour Board Amendment and Endowment Improvement Act 1912][15]:
    
    *   (f) nothing herein contained shall be deemed to deprive the Board of any powers it may possess as a leasing authority under the Public Bodies' Leases Act 1908 in respect of the whole or any part of the said area of 28 acres, and the said area of 92 acres respectively.

    *   (a) to acquire by purchase any areas of land lying adjacent to the Ahuriri Lagoon, or being within the outside boundaries thereof, including the before-mentioned islands, or any of them, or any part thereof respectively:
    
    *   (b) to sell any areas of land the property of the Board lying on or adjacent to the outside boundary lines of the Ahuriri Lagoon:
    
    *   (c) to exchange any areas of land, being parts of the Ahuriri Lagoon endowment, for any other areas of land lying adjacent to the Ahuriri Lagoon, or being within the outside boundaries thereof, including the before-mentioned islands, or any of them, or any part thereof respectively, and to pay or receive moneys for equality of exchange:
    
    *   (d) to take, or contract for the purchase of, in manner provided by the Public Works Act 1928 and under the provisions of that Act, any areas of land lying adjacent to the Ahuriri Lagoon, or being within the outside boundaries thereof, including the before-mentioned islands, or any of them, or any part thereof respectively; for which purposes the objects for which such areas of land are taken as aforesaid shall be deemed to be a public work, and the land so taken shall be deemed to be land required for a public work, within the meaning of the said Act:
    
    *   (e) to layout, make, form, metal, and dedicate as a public road any area of land the property of the Board for the purposes of affording a road frontage to any land alienated by the Board for any of the purposes aforesaid; or to grant rights of way over any area of land the property of the Board for the purpose of giving any alienee from the Board means of access to a public road.
    
    A recital contained in any instrument of alienation executed by the Board expressing that such instrument is entered into in conformity with this Act shall be conclusive evidence for the purposes of such instrument that the Board is acting within the bounds of the authority hereby conferred.

##### 6 Dealing with Maori land
    
*   (1) The Maori Land Court is hereby empowered to issue an order or orders vesting the legal estate of any of the islands mentioned in the [Preamble][2], or any other island situated in the Ahuriri Lagoon, which is Maori land, and of which the title has not been heretofore investigated, in such persons as the court shall appoint for the purpose, and thereupon the land mentioned in such order shall vest in such persons in the same manner as if the land had been then granted to those persons by the Crown, and the land shall be deemed to have been so granted accordingly, shall cease to be customary land, and shall become Maori freehold land within the meaning of the Maori Land Act 1931\.
    
    (2) The persons mentioned in any such order shall be deemed to be trustees, and shall have the power to sell, mortgage, lease, exchange, or otherwise deal with the land as fully as if they were the beneficial owners thereof.
    
    (3) The Maori Land Court may by order appoint a new trustee or trustees either in substitution for or in addition to any existing trustee and whether there is any existing trustee or not at the time of the making of the order. Any person so appointed shall have the same rights and powers as he would have had if appointed by a decree of the Supreme Court in an action duly instituted, and the trust property shall vest in the trustees for the time being without any conveyance, transfer, assignment, or assurance.
    
    (4) The trustees shall hold the said lands or the proceeds of any alienation thereof or any compensation therefor upon such trusts as the Maori Land Court shall from time to time declare.
    
    (5) It shall be lawful for the Board to purchase, exchange, or otherwise acquire any of the said land from the said trustees, and no transfer or other document shall require to be confirmed under Part 13 of the Maori Land Act 1931, but shall take effect according to its tenor, and shall, except in the case of fraud, be deemed to be valid and may be registered accordingly.
    
    (6) Any Maori land taken by the Board under the Public Works Act 1928 may be taken in the manner prescribed by Part 4 of that Act, and compensation shall be payable accordingly. All the provisions of that Part as to ascertainment of compensation shall apply. If the Maori Land Court has not theretofore made an order in accordance with subsection (1) in respect of any land taken it may appoint trustees, who shall be entitled to be paid the compensation and who shall hold the same upon trusts to be declared by the court from time to time. The provisions of subsection (3) relating to the appointment of new trustees shall apply to the trustees appointed under this subsection.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Napier Harbour Board Empowering Act 1932--33\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 27 November 1947, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][19] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][20] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][21] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][22] and [17E][23] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
