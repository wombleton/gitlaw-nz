An Act to enable certain lands at Port Waikato and certain moneys and investments derived from lands at Port Waikato to be transferred from the New Zealand Mission Trust Board to trustees elected by members of the sub-tribes of Ngati Karewa and Ngati Tahinga
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    Whereas by a deed bearing date 3 July 1839 the 17 persons therein described as the chiefs of Ngati Tahinga purported to deliver up, sell, and give away that portion of land, Maraetai, therein described which lies at the mouth of the river Waikato to Manihera (Reverend Robert Maunsell) and Ahiwera (Benjamin Ashwell) as land in perpetuity for the Committee of Missionaries of the Church of England or for any other person whom that said Committee might name, and gave up the land, the trees, the waters, and everything of every kind above and beneath that said land in return for payment of 1 Sovereign and certain goods: And whereas by a deed bearing date 30 August 1839 the 15 persons therein described as the chiefs of Ngati Karewa and Ngati Tahinga purported to deliver up, sell, and give up the kainga, the cultivations, the wood, namely, part of Putataka which also lies at the mouth of the river Waikato (and is adjacent to the land, Maraetai, comprised in the said deed of 3 July 1839) to the said Manihera and the said Ahiwera as a kainga (property), land, in perpetuity for the said Committee or for any person whom that Committee should name, and gave up the trees, the waters, and everything above and below that kainga in return for 3 pounds and certain goods: And whereas it was contemplated and understood by the said chiefs that the said land comprised in such deeds was to be used for a mission station and school for the benefit of their own people, such mission station and school to be provided and maintained by the said Committee of Missionaries or their successors: And whereas the said deeds were subsequently the basis of a land claim which was made by the Church Missionary Society and which was heard and examined by a Crown Commissioner who reported that he was of opinion that the said Society had made a bona fide purchase from such native chiefs and recommended that a grant of the said land should be issued to the said Society excepting 100 feet from high water mark: And whereas pursuant to the subsequent confirmation of such report by another Commissioner the said land was, by a deed of grant bearing date 1 November 1859 and registered in the Land Registry Office at Auckland under No 86G (1/21) (hereinafter called the crown grant), granted by the Crown to the Venerable George Adam Kissling, Archdeacon of Waitemata, and the Reverend Robert Burrows, Secretary of the Church Missionary Society in New Zealand, their heirs, and assigns for ever in trust for the Church Missionary Society for Africa and the East: And whereas the said land was ancestral land of the sub-tribes of Ngati Karewa and Ngati Tahinga: And whereas by a deed of conveyance bearing date 28 September 1896 and registered in the said registry office as No 136908 (R55/216) the said Robert Burrows, as the surviving trustee in whom the said land was then vested, conveyed the said land to The New Zealand Mission Trust Board (hereinafter called the Board), a body incorporated under the Religious, Charitable, and Educational Trust Boards Incorporation Act 1884 (now the [Charitable Trusts Act 1957][10]), in which Board the management of the affairs of the said Church Missionary Society for Africa and the East had become vested: And whereas portions of the said land have at various times been sold or dedicated as roads or reserves and the Board is now seized of the residue of the said land together with accretions thereto: And whereas portions of the said land have from time to time been leased and the Board is possessed of certain moneys and investments derived therefrom: And whereas the said land, monies, and investments are administered by the Board under the name of the Port Waikato Maraetai Trust: And whereas there having been neither a mission station nor a school on the said land since the year 1853 it is now just and desirable that the assets of the Port Waikato Maraetai Trust be transferred to trustees to be held on certain trusts for the benefit of the Maori people of New Zealand but so that preference is given to the peoples of the sub-tribes of Ngati Karewa and Ngati Tahinga: And whereas by a deed of trust made 13 June 1985 by Graham Uerata Clark of Otahuhu, watersider, Ngaire Nicola Clark of Otahuhu, his wife, Norman Nopera Hoete of Tuakau, farmer, George Haimona Tukua of Papakura, pensioner, and Vaal Huingahau Kukutai of Auckland, contractor, a charitable trust has been established for the purposes aforesaid: And whereas doubts exist as to whether the transfer can be effected otherwise than by legislation.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the New Zealand Mission Trust Board (Port Waikato Maraetai) Empowering Act 1986\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 16 September 1986, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][15] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][16] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][17] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][18] and [17E][19] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
