*   #### Preamble
    
    _Kupu Whakataki_
    
    (1) Kua whakatakotoria te Tiriti o Waitangi, tōna tauira reo Māori tōna tauira reo Pākeha hoki, i roto i te Wahanga 1 o [te Ture Tiriti o Waitangi 1975][246]. I hainatia te Tiriti nei i te tau 1840:
    
    (2) Mā ngā whiti (3) ki (53) o tēnei Kupu Whakataki ka kitea he whakarāpopototanga o ngā kōrero o muri i te kereme o nehe o Ngāti Awa kua whakatakotoria ki roto i te whakaaetanga whakataunga i whakamanahia i waenga i a Ngāti Awa rāua ko te Karauna:
    
    ###### Te hītori o te Whakataunga
    
    (3) Mai i te wā o te raupatu i 1866, kua whakatūria ngā tono paremata a Ngāti Awa ki te Karauna mō āna mahi hē, tae rawa ki te raupatu. Kua hīkina ngā taumahatanga mō ngā takahitanga i te Tiriti o Waitangi e tēnā, e tēnā whakatipuranga o Ngāti Awa i roto i ngā tau, tāne mai, wāhine mai. Whai muri iho o ngā petihana me ngā kawenga kōrero o ngā tau tōmuri o te rau tau 1800, me ērā o te tekau tau 1920, tae rawa ki te tekau tau 1960, ko te nekehanga nui, ko te whakatūnga e ngā kaumātua o Ngāti Awa pēnei i a Eruera Mānuera, i a Hāre Rēneti, i a Aniheta Rātene me Matarena Rēneti, i te Poari o Ngāti Awa i te tau 1980 i Puawairua, te marae o Ngāti Hikakino. I whakatūria te Poari e ngā hapū o Ngāti Awa hei kawe whakamua i ngā kaupapa mō te iwi, pēnei i te take raupatu (tae rawa ki te muru i ngā whenua, te noho manene o ngā hapū me te riro o te tino rangatiratanga), te whakatū pakari anō o te wharenui Mātaatua, te whakahokinga mai o te pāmu teihana o Ngāti Awa me te maunga Pūtauaki ki ngā ringaringa o te iwi. I whakarāpopotongia ngā whāīnga matua nei e Aniheta Ratene i roto i tana kōrero mō te Moenga, te Paraikete me te Urunga---ko te Moenga, koia tērā ko ngā whenua o Ngāti Awa i raupatuhia, ko te Paraikete, ko te pāmu teihana tērā o Ngāti Awa, ā, ko te Urunga, koia tērā ko ngā kerēme a Ngāti Awa mō Kawerau:
    
    (4) I te tau 1988, whai muri o tētahi whakahōunga o Te Ture mō [Te Tiriti o Waitangi 1975][246] e tarea ai te rongohia o ngā kerēme mai i 1840, i whakatakotoria e Ngāti Awa tana kerēme ki mua i te aroaro o Te Rōpū Whakamana i te Tiriti kia rangahaua ōna whakamau e pā ana ki te Tiriti. I te tau 1988, i runga i tāna kaupapa here ki te tuku i ngā whakahaere ki ngā poari whakahaere iwi, ā, i runga anō hoki i te tono a Ngāti Awa, i whakamanatia Te Ture mō Te Runanga o Ngati Awa 1988 arā, te ture whakatū i te Runanga. Ko tētahi wāhi o te ture nei i pā ki te wetewete i ngā whakawhiu ā-ture i mau ki runga i ētahi o te iwi i uru ki ngā nekenekehanga o te tau 1865:
    
    (5) Nō te tau 1990 i whakawhitia ai e te Karauna te pāmu teihana o Ngāti Awa ki Te Runanga o Ngati Awa. I tua atu, i ngā tau 1988 me 1990, tukuna ai e te Karauna ētahi utunga e $200,000 hui katoa ki Te Runanga o Ngati Awa. I te tau 1994, i whakawhitia ai e te Karauna ki a Ngāti Awa, ko te wāhi mahi a Telecom i Whakatāne, ko tōna wāriu i whakaaetia ai kia $390,000\. Hei tā Ngāti Awa titiro mai rā anō, he wāhanga noa iho ēnei o ngā utu mō ngā kerēme raupatu ki te Karauna:
    
    (6) Nō te rā 4 o te marama o Hūrae o te tau 1994, kātahi anō ka tīmata te take a Ngāti Awa ki mua i te aroaro o Te Rōpū Whakamana i te Tiriti, i te marae o Te Whare o Toroa i Whakatāne. I whakatakotoria e Ngāti Awa tana kerēme i roto i ētahi hui i tū ki te marae o Kokohīnau i Te Teko, ki te marae o Umutahi i Matatā, me te kapinga o āna kōrero i Te Whare o Toroa i te rā 1 o Tīhema o te tau 1995:
    
    (7) Nō te marama o Mei o te tau 1995, i whakaputaina e Te Rōpū Whakamana i te Tiriti tētahi whakaaturanga e kī ana, ahakoa kāore anō kia rongohia te Karauna, nā te kaha me te pakari o te kerēme a Ngāti Awa, tērā tonu pea ka nui te paremata me utu e te Karauna ki a ia mō ngā takahitanga a te Karauna i Te Tiriti o Waitangi i roto i ngā tau kua pahure. I whakaputaina tuatahitia te kōrero nei i roto i te whakaaturanga a Te Rōpū Whakamana i te Tiriti i te marama o Noema i te tau 1994:
    
    (8) I whakatakotohia, i kōrerohia tētahi tikanga whakahaere i waenganui i ngā hapū, Te Runanga me ngā kai-whiriwhiri i te hui ā-tau o te tau 1996, me ngā hui o muri a Te Runanga i roto i taua tau. Whai muri i tērā, i tū anō ngā hui me ngā whitiwhitinga kōrero e whiwhi mana kōkiri ai ngā kai-whiriwhiri. I whakaae te Runanga o te Kāwanatanga ki te mana kōkiri i te Ōketopa 1996:
    
    (9) I te rā 21 o te marama o Tīhema o te tau 1998, whai muri o tētahi toru tau e kōrerohia ana te kaupapa, ka uru te Karauna rāua ko Ngāti Awa ki tētahi Whakaaetanga ūpoko. Ko tā te Whakaaetanga ūpoko nei, he whakatakoto noa i ngā take e mātua whakaaetia ana me uru ki roto i te Tūtohinga Whakatau, me tā rāua whakaae tahi ki te whiriwhiri i runga i te ngākau pono ki te whakatutuki i ngā ritenga o te Tūtohinga Whakatau:
    
    (10) Nō te rā 8 o te marama o Ōketopa o te tau 1999 i oti i Te Rōpū Whakamana i te Tiriti tana pūrongo e kīia nei ko ""Te Pūrongo mō te Raupatu a Ngāti Awa"". Ko ngā whāinga matua o te pūrongo i kī, i raro i Te Tiriti o Waitangi, i te hē te mahi raupatu i ngā whenua o Ngāti Awa, ā, e kore e taea te kī i tū tētahi whana e whai take ai te raupatu i ngā whenua, me te mea ko te āhua nei, i tua atu kē te raupatu o ngā whenua o Ngāti Awa i te mana o Te Ture Whakatau Manene ki Niu Tīreni, 1863:
    
    (11) I tua atu, i kite anō Te Rōpū Whakamana i te Tiriti, he takahitanga tēnei o ngā mātāpono o te Tiriti o Waitangi, mēnā kāore i whakahokia mai ngā whenua i runga i te tikanga pai, mārakerake; he whakawhiu anō i a Ngāti Awa mō ana mahi whana tēnei te wehe i a ia mai i ngā whenua ki te taha uru o te rāina raupatu; i hurihia te taitara o ngā whenua ki te tangata takitahi, ā, ko te putanga o tēnei, ko te unuhanga o te mana o te iwi, ko te whakamāmā hoki i te huarahi hoko i te whenua. I tua atu i whakatau Te Rōpu Whakamana i te Tiriti, ko te huarahi e ea ai ngā kerēme a Ngāti Awa, mā te huarahi ki Te Runanga o Ngati Awa. Ahakoa te mea kāore i whakatakotohia e te Karauna ētahi whakaaturanga ki mua i te aroaro o Te Rōpū Whakamana i te Tiriti, me te mea anō ehara i te mea e whakaae ana ia ki te katoa o ngā whāinga o Te Rōpū Whakamana i te Tiriti, e whakaae ana te Karauna i mahi hē ia ki te raupatu i ngā whenua o Ngāti Awa, nā reira he takahitanga tēnā o ngā mātāpono o Te Tiriti o Waitangi:
    
    (12) Kāore i tau he whakaritenga i waenganui i te Karauna me Ngāti Awa i runga i ngā tāpaetanga o te tau 1998\. Nō te tau 2000 whakatakotoria ai e te Karauna tētahi tāpaetanga hōu:
    
    (13) I te 8 o Hurae 2002 ka whakaretangia e te Karauna me te Runanga o Ngāti Awa he whakaaetanga. Ka tatū i te Karauna me Ngāti Awa tāua whakaaetanga o ngā whakataunga i te 27 o Maehe 2003 e whakatatū ana i ngā take katoa e tika ana kia whakatauria tuturutia te katoa o ngā kereme o nehe o te iwi o Ngāti Awa:
    
    ###### Te Whakahokinga Mai o te Wharenui a Mātaatua
    
    (14) I ngā tau tōmua o te tekau tau 1870, i tahuri te iwi o Ngāti Awa ki te hanga i tētahi whare whakairo ki Whakatāne, ko tōna ingoa ko Mātaatua. I te tīmatanga o te tau 1875 i oti te hanga i te whare. Nō te tau 1879, i tukuna e te Karauna te whare Mātaatua ki tētahi whakaaturanga e kīia nei ko te Inter-colonial Exhibition i tū ki Poihākena, i Ahitereiria. Nō te tau 1880 i nekehia te whare ki Poi-piripiri, ki Rānana, ki reira whakaaturia ai. Nō te tau 1924 i whakahokia mai ai a Mātaatua, e aha ai, e uru atu ai ia ki te Whakaaturanga mō te Moana-nui-a-Kiwa i tū ki Ōtepoti. I whakaae te Karauna kia whakaaturia e Te Whare Taonga o Ōtepoti te whare whakairo mō ake tonu. Mai rā anō, kua rapu te iwi kia whakahokia mai te whare ki Whakatāne, me te kī a Ngāti Awa, kāore i tukuna e ia te mana mō Mātaatua ki tētahi atu. Nō te marama o Ākuhata o te tau 1996 i hainahia e Ngāti Awa rāua ko te Karauna tētahi Tūtohinga Whakatau mō te whakahokinga mai o Mātaatua ki a Ngāti Awa. I whai wāhi ki roto i te whakaaetanga nei ko te $2 miriona hei utu i te whakahoki mai me te whakatū o te wharenui a Mātaatua ki Whakatāne:
    
    ###### Te tāhū kōrero
    
    (15) E whai take ana te kupu whakapāha a te Karauna ki a Ngāti Awa i runga i te tāhū kōrero ka whai:
    
    ###### Te Rohe o Ngāti Awa
    
    (16) E whakapono ana a Ngāti Awa, i mua o te tau 1866, koia te tangata whenua, ā, nōna te tino rangatiratanga e hora ana i ētahi wā, ki runga i ngā whenua ka whai nei: ngā moutere o Motiti, o Rurima, o Mou-tohorā, Te Paepae o Aotea, Whakaari, a Ohakana rāua ko Uretara (he moutere ēnei kei te whanga o Ōhiwa), ngā wai mai i te wahapū o Waihī ki Ōhiwa; te whenua, ngā ngahere, ngā roto, ngā awa me ngā repo, mai i te wahapū o Waihī ki te raki, ā ka whai haere i te takutai tae rawa ki Ōhiwa, mai i te wahapū o Waihī anō, ka huri whaka-te-hau-ā-uru ki te awa o Pongakawa, ki te moutere o Rotoehu (tae rawa ki te papa o te roto o Rotoehu me te ngahere o Rotoehu), ā, mai i Rotoehu ki Te Haehaenga, tae atu ki te roto o Rotomā ki ngā whenua o Pokohu, o Tuararangaia me Matahina ki te tonga, ā, atu i reira ki te Whanga o Ōhiwa:
    
    (17) Ko ētahi o ngā wāhi nui i whakahuahuatia ai i roto i ngā tāhū kōrero mō Ngāti Awa ko: ngā maunga e kōrerohia nei ko Pūtauaki ki Kawerau, ko Whakapaukōrero ki Matatā me Maunga Whakamana ki Te Haehaenga, me te hiwi e kīia nei ko Te Tiringa ki Awakeri, tae rawa hoki ki Te Rae o Kōhī ki Whakatāne; ngā awa o Whakatāne, Ōrini, Rangitāiki, Tarawera, Wai-tahanui me ngā wai o Waikōwhewhe rāua ko Pongakawa; te repo o Rangitāiki; ngā ngahere i Rotoehu, i Matahina, i Kiwi-nui, i Ō-mata-roa, i Tarawera me Manawahē; ngā roto o Rotoehu, Rotomā, Kawerau, Te Tahuna, Onerahi, Roto-iti Paku, Onepū me Roto-roa; ngā waiariki i Kawerau, Awakeri, Mou-tohorā me Whakaari; ngā whanga i Ōhiwa me Whakatāne; ngā wahapū i Waihī, i Te Awa a Te Atua i Matatā, me Whakatāne:
    
    (18) I pupuritia ngā whenua me ngā rawa o Ngāti Awa i raro i ngā tikanga Māori, arā, ka noho hei mea tino nui rawa te kaitiakitanga ohu a-hapū, a-iwi. I mua o te raupatu, i mau tonu ngā rangatira o Ngāti Awa ki tō rātou rangatiratanga, ā, iti noa iho nei ngā whenua o roto i te rohe o Ngāti Awa i hokona:
    
    (19) I tua atu, ko te whakapae a Ngāti Awa, i te tau 1865 e noho motuhake ana rātou, i te hua ngā painga o ngā mahi kaipakihi. Ka mutu, i roto rātou i ngā mahi whitiwhiti taonga, tauhokohoko hoki. I te whakatipu, i te hoko rātou i ngā rawa pēnei i te poaka, i te harakeke, i ngā hua whenua, i te wīti, i te papa rākau me te rīwai, ā, i roto anō hoki rātou i te whānuitanga o ngā kaupapa tauhokohoko pēnei i te mira wīti me te whakahaere kaipuke. I te haere tonu ngā mahi whitiwhiti taonga a Ngāti Awa me ētahi atu iwi mō ngā taonga pēnei i te kōkōwai, te tītī me te nuinga atu o ngā rawa o te moana:
    
    ###### Te Ture Whakatau Manene ki Niu Tīreni 1863
    
    (20) Nō te tau 1863 i whakamanatia e te Karauna ētahi hanganga ture whakahirahira e toru arā, te Ture Tāmi i te Mahi Whana, te Ture Pūtea Taurewa o Niu Tīreni me te Ture Whakatau Manene ki Niu Tīreni. I āheitia e te ture whakamutunga te raupatu i ngā whenua Māori e tirohia ana e te Karauna ""nā tētahi iwi, nā tētahi wāhanga o tētahi iwi, nā tētahi rahinga mai i tētahi iwi rānei"" i mahi hara ki te mana o te Kuini. Ko te mea nui, i whakamanatia te ture ""ki te tiaki, ki te whakamaru tūturu i ngā tāngata pai o ngā iwi e rua, kia ārai atu i ngā mahi whana, kia pupuri hoki ki te mana o Te Arikinui Te Kuini i roto i te Ture me te Māriretanga puta noa i te whenua"". Hei whakatutuki i ēnei whāinga whānui e rua, i mea te Karauna ki te whakatū tāngata noho ki ngā rohe mā te hoko i ngā whenua raupatu ki te hunga whai. Ko te titiro a te Karauna mā ngā moni hua i ēnei hokonga whenua e ea ai ngā utu a te Karauna mō ana pakanga ki te Māori:
    
    (21) I te āwangawanga te Tari Koroni o Piritana mō te whānui me te whakamahi i te Ture Whakatau Manene ki Niu Tīreni 1863, e mea ana ia, ""ka taea ngā mahi tūkino nui"". I te tīmatanga, i te wā e whakaarohia ana te raupatu whenua, i whakatūpatohia e te Hēkeretari Koroni te Kāwana Tianara, kia aro nui ki ngā whenua o ngā tāngata me ngā iwi harakore, ā, kia hāngai hoki te whiunga ki te hara. Nō muri mai, i a ia ka noho ki te āta whakaaro mō te hanganga ture raupatu whenua, i te āwangawanga tonu te Tari Koroni o Piritana mō te whakamahi i te Ture me tōna roanga, engari i whakaaetia kia tū tonu nā te mea ko te mana whakamutunga rawa mō te raupatu ko te Kāwana. I tohungia e te Hēkeretari Koroni te Kāwana kia kaua ia e whakaae kia raupatuhia he whenua mēnā kāore i te ""tika, i te ngāwari"":
    
    ###### Te Kaokaoroa
    
    (22) E ai ki ngā kōrero tuku iho a Ngāti Awa, i te tau 1864, i uru atu ētahi o ngā hapū o Ngāti Awa pēnei i a Te Patu-tātahi, a Ngāti Hikakino me Ngāi Te Rangihouhiri II, me ētahi o Te Tāwera ki tētahi ope taua o ngā iwi o Mātaatua me ētahi atu iwi, ā, e mōhiotia nei ko Te Ope Taua o Te Tai Rāwhiti. E mea ana te ope nei ki te hou atu ki te rohe o Waikato ki te tautoko i ngā iwi o Waikato e ātete ana i te whakaeke pokanoa ō rātou whenua e ngā ope taua o te Karauna me ngā tāngata whai. I āraitia e Te Arawa te haere a te ope taua o Te Tai Rāwhiti nei mā te rohe o Rotorua. I tono ētahi o ngā iwi o Te Arawa ki te Karauna ki te tautoko i tā rātou mahi, ā, tautokona noa mai e te Karauna. I te marama o Pepuere o te tau 1864 i tū tētahi pakanga i waenganui i tētahi wāhanga o te ope taua o Te Tai Rāwhiti me ētahi o te iwi o Te Arawa, ki Roto-iti; mate atu ētahi ki reira. Hāunga tērā, he wāhanga o te ope nei i pakaru atu ki roto ki te rohe o Waikato, rokohina atu ko Ōrākau:
    
    (23) I Maketū, i te marama o Āperira o te tau 1864, ka ngana te ope taua o Te Tai Rāwhiti ki te pakaru atu mā te wahapū o Waihī. Nā ētahi o te iwi o Te Arawa, tāpae atu ko ngā waka taua me ngā hōia a te Karauna te ope taua o Te Tai Rāwhiti i whiu. Ko te whawhai nui o Te Kaokaoroa te whawhai i parekura atu ai a Ngāti Awa, me kī, ko ana kārangatanga hapū a Ngāti Hikakino me Ngāi Te Rangihouhiri II, tae rawa atu ki ētahi o ngā hapū me ngā iwi haumi. I hinga atu ki te pakanga nei ētahi o ngā rangatira nui o Ngāti Awa:
    
    ###### James Te Mautaranui Fulloon
    
    (24) Nō te tōmuritanga o te tau 1864, i tau atu a Kereopa, a Horomona me Pātara, ētahi poropiti o te whakapono Pai Mārire, ki te rohe o Whakatāne, ā, nā rātou ētahi o te iwi o Ngāti Awa i whakawai ki te uru ki te whakapono o Pai Mārire. I te marama o Maehe o te tau 1865 ka kōhurutia a Rev. Carl Volkner, he mihingare e noho ana ki Ōpōtiki, e ētahi o ngā Māori o taua takiwā kua taka ki te whakapono Pai Mārire. Nō te rā 6 o te marama o Maehe o te tau 1865 ka whakaputaina e ngā rangatira o Ngāti Awa ō rātou tino whakahē mō te patunga o Volkner; hāunga tērā, kāore rātou ngā rangatira o Ngāti Awa i whakaae kia haere te Karauna mā te rohe o Ngāti Awa i a ia ka rapu mō te hunga nā rātou a Volkner i patu. Kore rawa i whakamanatia e te Kāwanatanga te haere a tētahi o ōna ope taua mā te rohe o Ngāti Awa ki te rapu i te hunga nā rātou a Volkner i patu:
    
    (25) Nō te marama o Pepuere o te tau 1865, whai muri i ētahi rūnanga, ka hui ētahi rangatira o Ngāti Awa ki Whakatāne, i reira ka whakatakotoria ai e rātou tētahi aukati o tō rātou rohe, kia kaua tētahi noa atu e uru mai. Nāwai ā, i te marama o Hūrae i te tau 1865, whai muri i ētahi hui ki Tauaroa me Matatā, ka whakatakotoria ai tētahi atu aukati anō e te poropiti Pai Mārire e Horomona, me ētahi o ngā rangatira o Ngāti Awa tautoko i a ia. Mai i Whangaparāoa i te rāwhiti tae atu ki Taranaki i te uru te aukati nei. I te rā 19, te rā 20 rānei o Hūrae 1865 i tau ai ki Whakatāne a Maruiwi, tētahi kaipuke hokohoko nō Te Arawa. I hopukina te kaipuke, mō tōna takahi i te aukati a ngā Pai Mārire. Nō te rā 22 o te marama o Hūrae o te tau 1865 i tau atu ai te kaipuke _Kate_ ki Whakatāne. Ko ngā tāngata i runga i te kaipuke, ko James Fulloon, he āpiha nā te Karauna, me ētahi atu. I patua i runga i te kaipuke, a Fulloon, he uri nō Ngāti Awa, me ētahi kaumoana tokotoru, e ērā o Ngāti Awa i tautoko i te Pai Mārire. Kātahi ka tahuri a Wepiha Apanui o te pori o Ngāti Awa ki Whakatāne ki te whakarite mō te tanu i tōna uri, a Hēmi (James) Fulloon. He maha ngā kōrero he aha i patua ai a Fulloon; e ai ki a Ngāti Awa i patua ia mō tana takahi i te aukati. Nā ēnei nekenekehanga i korikori ake ngā hapū o Ngāti Awa:
    
    ###### Te Whakamana
    
    (26) Nō te rā 2 o te marama o Ākuhata o te tau 1865 i Maketū ka whakaputaina e T H Smith, te Kōmihana Kāwanatanga tana whakamana hopu tāngata mō te mau here i te hunga e whakapaetia ana nā rātou a Fulloon me ētahi atu i patu:
    
    (27) Ko ngā tāngata i te rārangi o te whakamana ko:

    (28) Nō te marama o Ākuhata o te tau 1865, i whakakotahihia tētahi ope taua a te Karauna e rima rau nei te tokomaha, he mea emi i ētahi o ngā hapū, iwi e noho tata ana ki a Ngāti Awa ka mutu, kua roa kē hoki e pakanga ana ki a Ngāti Awa mai rā anō; ko ētahi o te ope nei i roto i ngā riri o Te Kaokaoroa. Ko te kaingārahu o te ope taua nei a te Karauna ko Meiha William Mair, Te Kaiwhakawā. I kuhu atu te ope taua nei ki te rohe o Ngāti Awa ki te whakatutuki i te whakamana mau here. Nō te pokapū o te marama o Ākuhata whakamāramahia ai ki te rangatira o Ngāti Awa, a Te Hura Te Taiwhakaripi, he aha te kaupapa a te taua. I tū ētahi whakapāpā i waenganui i te taua a te Karauna me Ngāti Awa, ko te otinga atu i mate ētahi tāngata. I murua ngā kau, ngā hoiho me ētahi atu o ngā rawa a Ngāti Awa, i wāwāhia ngā kāinga, wharenui, pātaka, waka hoki o Ngāti Awa. I whakaekea ngā pā o Ngāti Awa i Whakatāne, i Matatā me Te Teko, te wāhi i rere ai a Te Hura me ana tāngata:
    
    (29) Nō te rā 2 o te marama o Hepetema o te tau 1865 i whakaputaina e te Karauna tētahi Pānuitanga Rongomau e kī ana kua mutu te pakanga i tīmata rā i Oakura, takiwā o Taranaki i te tau e 1863\. Ko tā te Pānuitanga Rongomau i whakamārama ai, e kore e whiua e te Karauna ērā i mau pū ki te Karauna i ngā raruraru o mua, hāunga ērā nā rātou a Fulloon i patu, kāore rātou i kuhuna ki raro i te tikanga o te pānuitanga nei. Ko ngā kupu o te pānuitanga i kī pēnei, ki te kore e tae ngā tāngata nā rātou a Fulloon i kōhuru ki te aroaro o te Kāwana, ka murua e te Karauna ngā whenua o ngā iwi nā rātou i manaaki te hunga kōhuru. I tua atu, i tono te pānui kia āwhinatia e te Māori te mahi aukati i ngā tutūnga puehu, ā, i takoto anō te hiahia ki te kōrerorero me ngā Rangatira nui, me pēhea e rongohia ai te reo o te Māori i roto i te Rūnanga Nui, e aha ai, e whai wāhi ai e te Māori ki te hanga ture hei whai māna:
    
    (30) Nō te marama o Hepetema o te tau 1865 ka whakaputaina e te Kāwana tētahi Pānuitanga Ture Taua mō ngā rohe o Whakatāne me Ōpōtiki, e taea ai te hopu i te hunga e whakapaetia ana nā rātou a Fulloon i kōhuru, e taea ai hoki te whakawā i a rātou mā te Whakawā Taua. Ko te tikanga, ka mau te Ture Taua ki runga i ngā rohe nei ā, tae noa ki te wā hīkina ai, ka mutu, ko tā te pānuitanga e mea ana, ka āhei ngā tāngata a te Karauna te tū anō nei he ope taua. Nō te rā e 5 o Hepetema o te tau 1865 pānuitia ai ēnei pānuitanga e rua ki te Kāhiti o Niu Tireni. Hāunga tērā, kāore i te mārama nōnahea mōhio ai a Ngāti Awa mō ēnei pānuitanga:
    
    ###### Te Kupenga
    
    (31) Kia tae ki te wāhanga tōmuri o te marama o Hepetema o te tau 1865, kua nui ake ngā korikoringa a ngā hōia o te Karauna. Ko te otinga atu, e toru rā e whawhai ana i te pā o Te Kupenga, takiwā ki Te Teko. Nāwai rā, ā, nō te rā 20 o te marama o Oketopa o te tau 1865, ka mutu i Te Kupenga te whawhai o ngā hapū o Ngāti Awa i raro i te ārahitanga o Te Hura Taiwhakaripi. Ko ētahi o ngā hapū i roto i te whawhai nei ko Te Tāwera, Warahoe, Ngāi Te Rangihouhiri II, Te Patu-tātahi, Ngāti Hikakino me ētahi atu. Kō atu i te 30 ngā tāne, tae noa ki te nuinga o ērā i te rārangi ingoa o te whakamana me ētahi atu, i mauheretia, i kawea hoki ki Ōpōtiki, kia whakawātia e te Kōti Taua i te marama o Nōema o te tau 1865, mō te patunga o Fulloon, mō ētahi atu whakapae. I whakatau te Kōti Taua he tokomaha rātou i hara, ā, ko te hunga nei i whiua kia whakamatea:
    
    ###### Ngā Whakawātanga
    
    (32) Nō te rā 23 o te marama o Tīhema o te tau 1865 ka whakatakoto whakaaro a James Prendergast, te Rōia Matua mō ngā whakawātanga mā te kōti taua, i ngā mauhere i kawea ki Ōpōtiki. E ai ki a Prendergast ""ehara i te mea tika i raro i te ture"" te ture taua. Nāwai ā, ka tono te Kāwana kia kawea ngā mau here o Ngāti Awa ki Tāmaki-makau-rau, ki reira whakawātia anō, ki mua tonu i te aroaro o te Kōti Matua, mō te kōhuru me ētahi atu whakawhiu. Kotahi te rōia i tū mō te hunga e 35 o Ngāti Awa:
    
    (33) E whai ake nei ko te rārangi ingoa o rātou o ngā tāngata i whakawhiua mō te tāhae waka me te kōhuru i a Fulloon me kaumoana Ned i runga i te waka _Kate_: Mikaere Kirimangu, Hekara, Himone-te-Auru, Paraharaha, Hoani Poururu, Hoani Hupe, Utuku-te-Rangi, Te Aka o Tau-te-Hura, Hunia Marupo, Haki Waihou, Haki Tukino, Tamati o Ngāti Hoko, Tio Wahu, Hawera-te-Hihira, Heahea te Pakihiwi, Raniera te Werotokotoko. I unuhia ngā whakapae i runga i te tokotoru o ngā tāngata nei mō te tāhae waka, engari katoa rātou i whakaaetia e te kōti he tangata hara mō te mahi kōhuru. Tekau atu anō ngā tāngata i kīia e te kōti nā rātou i awhi te hunga nā rātou ngā mahi kōhuru. Ko ēnei tāngata ko Te Hura Te Tai, Te Pitoiwi Te Putarera, Hepeta Te Tai, Horomona Poropiti, Mohi te Paohi, Te Hemara, Hakaraia Tohora, Te Uwhi Te Haraki, Kereama Toitoi me Ture Te Matutaera. I tua atu, tokoono ngā tāngata i whakawhiua mō te whiwhi rawa i tāhaetia i te _Kate_. Kia tae ki te rā 23 o te marama o Maehe o te tau 1866, ko te hunga katoa i tū ki mua o te aroaro o te Kōti i whakataungia e te Kōti i hara, ā, i whiua kia whakamatea, kia mauhereheretia rānei. Nō te rā 17 o Mei o te tau 1866 whakamatea ai a Mikaere Kirimangu rāua ko Horomona Poropoti (o Taranaki) mō te kōhuru i a Fulloon. Tuangahuru mā tahi o rātou i whiua kia whakamatea i hurihia kia mauheretia mō ake tonu atu, ā, ko te toenga o ngā tāngata nei i whakahaua e te Kōti kia whakamatea, i takahurihia e te Kōti kia mauheretia ētahi o rātou mō ngā tau e whā, piki atu ki te tekau mā whā tau. Ko ērā i hara mō te whiwhi rawa i tāhaetia, i whiua kia mauheretia mō ngā tau e toru. No ngā tau 1867 me 1868 i wetekina te hara i runga i ētahi o ngā tāngata nei, engari ko te nuinga i mauheretia ā, eke noa te wā i whakaritea mō rātou. Tokotoru rātou i mate i te wā e mauheretia ana rātou arā, ko Tamati o Ngāti Hoko (rā 1 o Ākuhata o te tau 1866), a Hepeta Te Tai (rā 26 o Nōema o te tau 1866), a Paraharaha (rā 18 o Tīhema o te tau 1866). Kāore i karakiahia, i poroporoakihia rānei ēnei tāngata i mate ki roto i te whare herehere. Rite ana ngā tono a ngā whakatipuranga i roto i ngā tau kia whakahokia ngā kōiwi o ō rātou whanaunga ki a rātou; nō te tau e 1988 tutuki ai ā rātou tono:
    
    (34) Hei tā Ngāti Awa, tokomaha tonu ērā i tukuna, kāore i hiahia hoki ki ō rātou kāīnga i Whakatāne me Matatā nā te whakamā i runga i tō rātou mauheretanga me te rironga atu o ō rātou whenua. I noho rātou i te taha i a Te Kooti, i Te Rohe Pōtae, i raro i te maru o Ngāti Maniapoto. Ko te nuinga i mate, i takoto ki waho kē o te rohe o Ngāti Awa, engari nā runga i te mahi a Te Kooti me āna tāngata, nō te tau 1885 hahua ai rātou, ka tanumia ki te Urupā o Ohuirere, takiwā ki Whakatāne:
    
    ###### Te Raupatu Whenua
    
    (35) Nā runga i te mana o ngā Tono ā-Kaunihera i tukuna i te rā 17 o te marama o Hānuere me te rā 1 o te marama o Hepetema o te tau 1866, whai muri mai hoki o tā te Karauna i kī, i hara ngā iwi o Te Moana o Toi, āhua e 448 000 eka te rahi o ngā whenua i pānuitia ai kia raupatuhia i raro i te Ture Whakatau Manene ki Niu Tīreni, 1863\. Kāore te Ture i kōrero mō te utu, engari ko te whiu tonu ia tōna whāinga:
    
    (36) Ko te ripa tauārai o ngā whenua i raupatutia, ko:
    
    "_Ngā whenua katoa pōkaitia ai e te ripa tauārai, mai i te pūwaha o te awa o Wai-tahanui, haere whaka-te-tonga mō tētahi 20 maero; kātahi ka hāngai te haere ki te tihi o (Mt Edgecombe) Putanaki \[sic\], mai i reira ka rere whaka-te-rāwhiti ki tētahi wāhi 11 maero ki te taha tonga o te pūwaha o te whanga o Ōhiwa, ā, tōtika ana te haere ki te rāwhiti mō tētahi 25 maero; kātahi ka ripa atu ki te pūwaha o te awa o Araparapara \[sic\], huri haere i te takutai ā, kia tau atu ki te tīmatanga i Wai-tahanui._"
    
    (37) I roto i te whenua pōkaitia ai i raro i te maru o te tono, āwhiwhi e 245 000 eka te rahi o ngā whenua o Ngāti Awa i raupatutia i te tau 1866\. He mahi pokanoa tēnei mahi, nō te mea nui rawa atu ngā whenua i raupatutia, ki tērā rahi o te whenua e ea ai ngā kaupapa i raro i te Ture Whakatau Manene ki Niu Tīreni:
    
    (38) I pā ki ngā hapū katoa o Ngāti Awa te raupatunga o ngā whenua, tae rawa ki te hunga kāore rawa i ātete ki te Karauna. Ko te otinga atu o tēnei, me haere rā anō ngā hapū o Ngāti Awa ki mua i te aroaro o te Kōti Utunga me ētahi atu wāhi, rapu ai kia whakahokia mai ō rātou whenua:
    
    ###### Ngā Whakaritenga a Wilson me te Kōti Utunga
    
    (39) Nō te marama o Pēpuere o te tau 1866, i mua o te noho a te Kōti Utunga, ka whakaingoatia e te Karauna tana kaikōmihana hira, a John A Wilson ki te whakarite i te toha o ngā whenua i raupatutia i Te Moana o Toi. I uru atu a Wilson ki ētahi kōrerorero me ētahi o ngā hapū mō te whakahokinga mai o ētahi whenua. I whiwhia ētahi o ngā iwi o Te Arawa me ētahi atu ki ētahi toha mō ā rātou kawe ā-riri ā, ko ngā toha nei, mai i ngā rohenga whenua o te taha hau-ā-uru o te awa o Tarawera, ka taea te kī ka taka i roto i ngā toha nei, ko te nuinga o ngā whenua e kīia ana e Ngāti Awa ko ōna rohe o te taha hau-ā-uru (he whenua ēnei e kerēmehia ana e ētahi atu iwi). Kia taka ki te tau 1885, kua hokona kē e te Karauna te nuinga o te whenua nei. Ko te whakaritenga a Wilson, kia whakahokia ā-whenua rāhui nei te e 77 000 eka ki ngā tāngata takitahi o Ngāti Awa. Koianei tēnei tētahi wāhanga o te 245 000 eka i murua tuatahitia i te tau 1866:
    
    (40) I whakahaerehia ngā mahi a Wilson i raro i ngā wāhanga o Te Ture Whakatau Manene ki Niu Tīreni, 1863, tae rawa ki ana whakahōunga. E whai mana ai āna whakaritenga, i whakamanatia ai e te Karauna ētahi atu hanganga ture pēnei i Te Ture Whenua Raupatu 1867, Te Ture Hoko Whenua i Richmond 1870, Te Ture Whakamana Toha Whenua i Whakatāne 1878, Te Ture Kerēme Whenua Māori me Te Ture Whakamana Taitara o te tau 1894:
    
    (41) Nā Te Ture Whakatau Manene ki Niu Tīreni 1863, ka whakatūria ai Te Kōti Utunga ki te aha, ki te utu i ngā tāngata i raupatuhia ō rātou whenua, ahakoa te mea kāore rātou i te ""hara"". Nō te marama o Maehe o te tau 1867 i tīmata ai ngā hui a te Kōti i te rohe. Ko ngā Kaiwhakawā ko William Mair rāua ko Thomas Smith, ko rāua tonu ētahi o ngā kaiārahi i ngā ope taua a te Karauna i mua tonu o te raupatu. He maha ngā wā, whakamanahia ai e te Kōti ngā whakaritenga a Wilson, anō nei he whakataunga i waho ake o te kōti:
    
    (42) Ko ērā tāngata o Ngāti Awa kāore i te pīrangi whakatau kerēme me Wilson, i whakatakoto kerēme kē me te Kōti; waihoki, ko ērā te hunga kāore i āhei ki te haere ā-tinana ki te Kōti ki te whai i ā rātou kerēme, tae tonu ki ērā te hunga i mauheretia i te tau 1866, i taka ki waho o ēnei whakaritenga. Hei ētahi wā, nā te tōmuri o te tae o ngā pānui, me te tawhiti ki te haere ki ngā nōhanga a te Kōti, tae rawa ki ērā nōhanga i waho atu i te rohe o Ngāti Awa, kāore te hunga whai pānga e tae ake:
    
    (43) Ahakoa te mau i herea ngā kai-tono Māori ki ngā whakahaere o Te Kōti Utunga kei whiua ki waho, nō te tau 1866 puta ai te whakamana tōmuri a te Paremata e mea ana, kei te tika katoa ngā mahi a te Kōti, ahakoa te mea tērā kāore i tutuki ētahi o ngā whakaritenga ā-ture:
    
    (44) Nō muri mai ka āraitia e te hātepe utunga a Ngāti Awa ngā rohenga whenua ka taka ki roto i te rāina raupatu me ērā whenua i te taha uru o te rohe o Ngāti Awa arā, ngā rohenga whenua o Matatā 31, 39, me 63\. Hui katoa e 50 000 eka te rahi o te whenua nei, ā, ka taka te nuinga o te rohe whaka-te-uru e kerēmehia ana e Ngāti Awa ki roto. Mō te take o Matata Lot 63, he nui ngā kōrero i whakatakotoria e ngā kaiwhakaatu o Ngāti Awa ki mua i te aroaro o te Kōti, ā, i tautokongia aua kōrero e ētahi o ngā iwi o Te Arawa. Ahakoa tēnei, i whiwhia e te kōti aua whenua ki iwi kē ki hapū kē, ki ētahi i whawhai mō te Karauna. Kāore he huarahi hoki atu ki te pīra i ngā whakatau a te kōti:
    
    (45) Nā te tikanga utunga kātahi ka pōuri rawa atu te iwi o Ngāti Awa mō ngā mahi raupatu whenua. Kāore i te tino mōhiotia ko wai te hunga e āhei ana ki te tono utunga i te Kōti. Hei ētahi wā tekau tau e tāria ana kātahi anō ka whiwhi rātou ki te pūtea Kāwanatanga mō te whenua i whakahokia. I whiwhi ētahi hapū ki ngā whenua o hapū kē, ka mutu, ka mate ngā hapū o Ngāti Awa ki Whakatāne ki te tiaki i ngā tāngata o hapū kē ki runga ki ō rātou whenua, tae rawa ki ērā mai i te rohe o Matatā i uru ki roto i ngā pakanga o ngā tau 1864 me 1865\. He nui tonu te whenua poupou, koraha i whakaritea e Wilson hei whakahoki. Ina whakahokia ngā whenua mā ngā whakaritenga a Wilson, mā ngā tikanga a te Kōti Utunga rānei, ka whakahokia kē ki te tangata takitahi, āpā te hapū, te iwi rānei. Kāore i whai wāhi ki ngā toha nei ngā tikanga tūturu mō te whenua, ā, mōrearea te noho a te whenua, kei hokona:
    
    (46) I ngā tau whai muri mai, kāore i aronuitia ngā pānga a Ngāti Awa ki ngā rohenga whenua i te taha hau-ā-uru o te raina raupatu, i roto i ngā toha a Te Kōti Whenua Māori. Hei tā Ngāti Awa, nā runga i ngā nekenekehanga o roto i ngā tau mai i te 1865 ki te 1867, tae rawa ki ngā whakataunga a Te Kōti Utunga i taua wā, i raru ai a Ngāti Awa i roto i ngā kēhi o muri mai a Te Kōti Whenua Māori e pā ana ki ngā rohenga whenua nei:
    
    ###### Ngā Mahi o Ngā Ture Whenua Māori, Ngā Hoko me ētahi atu Wehewehenga o muri iho
    
    (47) Whakatūria ai te Kōti Whenua Māori i raro i ngā Ture Whenua Māori o ngā tau 1862 me 1865, ki te rapu ko wai te hunga nō rātou ngā whenua ""e ai ki te Tikanga Māori"", ki te takahuri hoki i te mana tūturu mō te whenua, kia noho ko ngā taitara a te Karauna ki runga i te whenua. I whakatahangia hoki te tika a te Karauna ki te hoko tuatahi i ngā whenua o te Māori, e aha ai, e taea ai e te Māori te rīhi, te hoko rānei i ōna whenua, kāore he nui o ngā here. Kāore i nui ngā whakawhitiwhiti kōrero i waenganui i te Karauna me te Māori i mua o te whakamanatanga o te ture nei, kāore hoki ia i āta kōrero ki a Ngāti Awa; he pērā te āhua o ēnei mea i te tekau tau 1860\. I tēnei wā, kāore he waha kōrero mō te Māori i roto i te Paremata. Nā reira ko tō Ngāti Awa whakaaro, he mea uhi kē e tētahi atu tēnei tikanga tiaki whenua ki runga i a rātou:
    
    (48) I te tekau tau o 1870, i whakahaua ngā āpiha hoko whenua ki te hoko whenua i te rohe o Rangitaiki, ā, hei ētahi wā, ka whakarite rīhi, ka whakawhiti whenua rātou i mua o te haria o te whenua ki mua i te aroaro o Te Kōti Whenua Māori kia āta rangahauatia te taitara. I ngā tekau tau 1870, 1880 me 1890, whakatakotohia ai e Ngāti Awa ana kerēme ki ētahi whenua i te taha tonga o te rāina raupatu. Kāore i tautokona e te Kōti ā rātou tono mō ngā rohenga whenua i Ruātoki me Kaingaroa. I roto i tēnei wā, whakawhiwhia ai ētahi hapū o Ngāti Awa ki ētahi pānga whenua i ngā rohenga whenua o Pokohu, Pūtauaki, Matahina, Waiohau me Tuarārangaia. I te nuinga o te wā, i tukuna e te Kōti ētahi wāhanga o ngā rohenga whenua nei ki iwi kē, ahakoa te mea hei tā Ngāti Awa, no rātou ake te whenua. No muri kē, mā te hanganga ture, ka whakahaua e te Kōti kia whakarongohia anō ngā kōrero mō ētahi o ngā rohenga whenua. Ko te otinga atu o tēnei, i riro atu ētahi o ngā whenua i tukuna tuatahitia ki a Ngāti Awa i Pokohū me Matahina:
    
    (49) No muri o tētahi rangahau taitara i te tau 1881, whakawhiwhia a Ngāti Awa ki te e 79 000 eka i roto i te rohenga o Matahina. Nō te tau 1884 rongohia anō ngā kōrero, ā, ko te hua o tērā, i whakaitia te korahi o te rohenga ki te e 74 300 eka. E 8 500 eka o tēnei rahi i tangohia e te Karauna e ea ai ngā utu rūri. I whakawhiwhia e Te Kōti Whenua Māori ngā pānga ki ngā tāngata takitahi, ā, ahakoa i pupuritia ngā whenua mō tētahi wā i runga i ngā okeoke a Ngāti Awa kia pupuria, kia tae ki te rau tau e 20, kua mārō kē te haere o te wehewehe whenua ki ngā tāngata takitahi. Ko te hua o tēnei, i noho kongakonga noa ngā whenua, i maha ngā hokohoko whenua i te wāhanga tōmuri o te rau tau e 19 me te wāhanga tōmua o te rau tau e 20\. Kia taka ki te tau 1980, e 240 eka anake te rahi o te pānga whenua o Ngāti Awa ki roto i Matahina A1D1\. He mate nui ki te iwi o Ngāti Awa tēnei te rironga atu o te rohenga nei, ā, kei roto i te waiata Tangi mō Matahina e whakaata ana te mamae:
    
    (50) Ko Pūtauaki te tipuna maunga o ngā tāngata katoa o Ngāti Awa. I tauwehea a Pūtauaki e te rāina raupatu, nāwai ā nō te tau 1867, ka tukuna ai te taha whaka-te-raki o te maunga e Te Kōti Utunga ki a Te Pahipoto rāua ko Ngā Maihi. Ko te wāhanga whaka-te-tonga o te maunga i roto kē i te rohenga whenua e kīia nei ko Pūtauaki. I te tau 1879 i tū tētahi whakaritenga -- me āna tikanga - i waenganui i ngā āpiha hoko a te Karauna me ētahi o Ngāti Awa kia hokona te rohenga whenua, engari nō te tau 1881 kātahi anō te rohenga whenua nei ka rangahaua e Te Kōti Whenua Māori. I tukuna e te Kōti te whenua ki a Ngāti Awa, ā ka tono te iwi kia rāhui motuhaketia te whenua. Waihoki, i te hipanga o ngā rā e tekau, i runga hoki i te tono a ētahi rangatira tokorua o Ngāti Awa, arā, a Rangitūkehu rāua ko Penetito, i wehea e te Kōti te rohenga whenua ki ngā wāhanga e toru. Ko te rohenga whenua nui rawa atu, i tukuna ki ētahi tāngata takitahi e 15, ā, hokona wawetia e rātou ki te Karauna. Kāore e tino maha ngā rā whai muri, e 27 ngā tāne, wāhine, tamariki hoki i petihana ki te Minita mō Ngā Take Māori mō te mahi tauwehe i te rohenga whenua nei. Nō muri kē ka tono te hunga nā rātou te whenua i hoko ki te Karauna, kia whakahokia tēnei me ētahi atu rohenga whenua, ā, ko te utu mō tēnei, ko te moni i homaihia mō te hoko i te whenua i te tuatahi, engari kāore te Karauna i whakaae. Ko te iti noa o te rohenga whenua i mahue mai, tae rawa ki te maunga, i tukuna ki ētahi tāngata takitahi mai i Ngāti Awa me ētahi atu iwi. Nā ēnei mahi whakatakitahi i te mana whenua, ka ngaro noa i te iwi ēnei whenua. He whakamau nui tā Ngāti Awa, mō te rironga atu o Pūtauaki mā ngā tikanga rerekē i ngā rau tau tekau mā iwa, rua tekau hoki:
    
    (51) I tua atu, kua riro ētahi whenua o Ngāti Awa pēnei i ngā rohenga whenua i Rangitāiki, Poroporo-Rewatu, Matahina, Whakatāne, me Matata mā ngā hanganga ture mahi tūmatanui o te rau tau rua tekau. He wāhi tapu, he urupā, he papakāinga i runga i ētahi o ngā whenua i riro:
    
    (52) Mai i te tau 1867, kua rapu a Ngāti Awa i te tika, mō ngā hē i mahia ki te iwi e te Karauna. He maha ngā petihana a Ngāti Awa ki te Karauna mō ngā raupatu, ngā mauheretanga, me te rironga atu o ngā whenua i roto i te wā roa. I tae te kaupapa a Ngāti Awa ki mua i te aroaro o te Kōmihana Sim i te tau 1927, ā, kāore i tautokongia e te Kōmihana te kaupapa whānui a Ngāti Awa. Hāunga tērā, i kite te Kōmihana, paku noa iho te whenua i tohaina ki a Ngāi Te Rangihouhiri II rāua ko Ngāti Hikakino. Nō muri mai ka tangohia ai tētahi wāhanga o te whenua nei i raro i Te Ture Mahi Tūmatanui, ā, i te mutunga, i toe mai ki ngā hapū nei ko ētahi whenua tītōhea anake, e kore e puta he oranga. I tūtohu te Kōmihana ki te toha i ētahi whenua i Matatā, engari kāore tēnei tūtohu i puāwai:
    
    (53) I runga i ngā tūtohinga o te Kōmihana Sim, whiwhi ai ētahi atu iwi ki ētahi utunga ā-tau mai i te Karauna, ā, whakatūria ai ētahi Poari mō ētahi iwi raupatu, hāunga anō a Ngāti Awa.
    
    ###### Background
    
    (1) The Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti o Waitangi), as set out in English and in Māori in [Schedule 1][247] of the Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975, was signed in 1840:
    
    (2) Recitals (3) to (53) of this Preamble present, in summary form, the background to the Ngāti Awa historical claims that is set out in the deed of settlement entered into by Ngāti Awa and the Crown:
    
    ###### Background to settlement
    
    (3) Since the time of the raupatu in 1866, Ngāti Awa has sought redress for its grievances against the Crown including the confiscation of land from Ngāti Awa. The responsibility for seeking redress for breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti o Waitangi) has passed through many generations of Ngāti Awa men and women. Following the petitions and representations of the late 19th century, the 1920s, and up to the 1960s, the next significant effort occurred in 1980 with the establishment of the Ngāti Awa Trust Board at the Ngāti Hikakino marae, Puawairua by the hapū and kaumatua of Ngāti Awa including Eruera Manuera, Hare Reneti, Aniheta Ratene, and Matarena Reneti. The hapū of Ngāti Awa established the Trust Board to progress various issues on behalf of the iwi and in particular, to seek redress for the raupatu (including the loss of land, dislocation of hapū, and loss of rangatiratanga), the restoration of Mātaatua wharenui, the return of the Ngāti Awa station, and the return of Putauaki. These principal goals of the Trust Board were encapsulated by Aniheta Ratene in the phrase the bed, the blanket and the pillow---the bed symbolized the lands confiscated from Ngāti Awa, the blanket represented the Ngāti Awa station and the pillow embodied the Ngāti Awa claims to Kawerau:
    
    (4) In 1988, following an amendment to the [Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975][246] to allow hearing of claims back to 1840, Ngāti Awa lodged its claim with the Waitangi Tribunal to investigate its Treaty grievances. In 1988 the Crown, in accordance with its policy of devolution to iwi authorities and at the request of Ngāti Awa, enacted [Te Runanga o Ngati Awa Act 1988][248] establishing the Runanga. This included a statutory pardon for those members of Ngāti Awa involved in the events of 1865:
    
    (5) In 1990 the Crown transferred the Ngāti Awa station to Te Runanga o Ngati Awa. The Crown also made payments totalling $200,000 to Te Runanga o Ngati Awa in 1988 and 1990\. In 1994, the Crown transferred the Whakatāne Telecom site at an agreed value of $390,000 to Ngāti Awa. Ngāti Awa has always regarded these returns as part settlement of its raupatu claims against the Crown:
    
    (6) On 4 July 1994, Ngāti Awa finally began its Waitangi Tribunal case at Te Whare o Toroa Marae in Whakatāne. Ngāti Awa presented its claims at hearings at Kokohinau Marae in Te Teko and Umutahi Marae in Matata, completing the process at Te Whare o Toroa on 1 December 1995:
    
    (7) In May 1995, the Waitangi Tribunal issued a memorandum observing that, although the Crown had yet to be heard, Ngāti Awa had demonstrated significant and compelling claims that were likely to require substantial compensation from the Crown to remedy past breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti o Waitangi). This point was previously made by the Waitangi Tribunal in its memorandum in November 1994:
    
    (8) A mandate protocol between the hapū, the Runanga, and the negotiators was prepared and discussed at an annual general meeting in 1996 and at subsequent hui of the Runanga during that year. This was followed by further hui and consultations to confirm the mandate of the negotiators. Cabinet recognised the mandate in October 1996:
    
    (9) On 21 December 1998, following 3 years of discussions and negotiations the Crown and Te Runanga o Ngati Awa entered into a heads of agreement. This recorded on a without prejudice basis the matters which they had agreed in principle should be contained in a deed of settlement to effect a settlement of Ngāti Awa's historical claims, and their agreement to negotiate in good faith to settle the terms of the deed of settlement:
    
    (10) On 8 October 1999, the Waitangi Tribunal completed its report entitled ""The Ngāti Awa Raupatu Report"". The principal findings of the Tribunal were that the confiscation of the lands of Ngāti Awa was contrary to the Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti o Waitangi), that there was no rebellion to justify confiscation, and that confiscation as effected against Ngāti Awa appears to have been beyond the authority of the New Zealand Settlements Act 1863:
    
    (11) The Tribunal also found that it was contrary to the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti o Waitangi) that the return of lands and reserves was not effected by a fair and open process; that Ngāti Awa's exclusion from the lands to the west of the confiscation line was an additional retribution for their perceived rebellion; that tribal land was converted to individual shareholding and tribal authority was therefore removed and the land was exposed to alienation. The Tribunal also concluded that the claims of Ngāti Awa should be settled by the Crown through Te Runanga o Ngati Awa. While the Crown did not present evidence to the Tribunal and does not necessarily agree with all the findings made by the Waitangi Tribunal, the Crown had acknowledged that the confiscation against Ngāti Awa constituted an injustice and was therefore in breach of the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti o Waitangi):
    
    (12) In the meantime, the Crown and Ngāti Awa were unable to reach agreement on the basis of the 1998 offer. The Crown made a revised settlement offer in 2000:
    
    (13) The Crown and Te Runanga o Ngati Awa initialled a deed on 8 July 2002\. Ngāti Awa ratified the Crown's settlement offer and entered into a deed of settlement on 27 March 2003 recording matters to give effect to a full and final settlement of all Ngāti Awa's historical claims:
    
    ###### Return of Mātaatua wharenui
    
    (14) In the early 1870s the people of Ngāti Awa undertook the construction at Whakatāne of a carved meeting-house, Mātaatua. Construction of Mātaatua was completed at the beginning of 1875\. In 1879 Mātaatua was sent by the Crown for exhibition at the Inter-colonial Exhibition in Sydney, Australia. In 1880 the house was sent to Melbourne, then to London to be exhibited. Mātaatua returned to New Zealand in 1924 for the South Seas Exhibition in Dunedin. The Crown agreed to allow the University Museum in Otago to exhibit the meeting-house on permanent loan. Ngāti Awa has always maintained that it did not transfer title to Mātaatua and sought the return of the meeting-house to Whakatāne. In August 1996 Ngāti Awa and the Crown signed a deed of settlement to return Mātaatua to Ngāti Awa. This agreement included a Crown payment of $2 million for the costs of transporting and establishing Mātaatua Wharenui at Whakatāne:
    
    ###### Historical account
    
    (15) The apology from the Crown to Ngāti Awa is based on the following historical account:
    
    ###### Rohe of Ngāti Awa
    
    (16) Ngāti Awa claim that prior to 1866 they exercised tino rangatiratanga as tangata whenua from time to time over their rohe including: the islands of Motiti, the Rurima group, Moutohorā (Whale Island), Paepae o Aotea (Volkner Rocks), Whakāri (White Island), Ohakana, and Uretara (both the latter 2 islands being situated in Ōhiwa Harbour); the seas from Waihi Estuary near Maketu to Ōhiwa Harbour; the land, forests, lakes, rivers, and swamps bounded to the north by the coastline from Waihi Estuary to Ōhiwa, to the west from the Waihi Estuary along the Pongakawa River to Lake Rotoehu (including the lake itself and the Rotoehu Forest), from Lake Rotoehu to Te Haehaenga, and including Lake Rotoma to the Pokohu, Tuararangaia, and Matahina lands to the south and from there to Ōhiwa Harbour:
    
    (17) Places of historical and cultural significance to Ngāti Awa include: the mountains called Putauaki at Kawerau (Mt Edgecumbe), Whakapaukorero at Matata and Maunga Whakamana at Te Haehaenga, the hill called Te Tiringa at Awakeri, and Koohi Point at Whakatāne; the rivers Whakatāne, Orini, Rangitaiki, Tarawera, Waitahanui, and the Waikowhewhe and Pongakawa Streams; the Rangitaiki swamp and wetlands; the forests at Rotoehu, Matahina, Kiwinui, Omataroa, Tarawera, and Manawahe; the lakes Rotoehu, Rotoma, Kawerau, Te Tahuna, Roto-Onerahi, Rotoiti Paku, Onepu, and Rotoroa; the thermal areas at Kawerau, Awakeri, Moutohorā, and Whakāri; the harbours at Ōhiwa and Whakatāne; and the estuaries at Waihi, Te Awa a Te Atua at Matata, and Whakatāne:
    
    (18) Ngāti Awa land and resources were held in customary tenure where tribal and hapū collective custodianship remained paramount. In the exercise of their rangatiratanga the chiefs of Ngāti Awa ensured that very little land within the Ngāti Awa rohe was permanently alienated prior to the confiscation:
    
    (19) Further, Ngāti Awa claim that in 1865 they were essentially autonomous, economically prosperous, and actively engaged in trade and commerce. They produced and sold commodities such as pigs, flax, vegetables, wheat, timber, and potatoes and were involved in a range of commercial activities including flour milling and merchant shipping. Ngāti Awa also used commodities such as red ochre, mutton-birds, and the resources of the sea for customary trade with other iwi:
    
    ###### New Zealand Settlements Act 1863
    
    (20) In 1863, the Crown enacted three important pieces of legislation, the Suppression of Rebellion Act, the New Zealand Loan Act, and the New Zealand Settlements Act, the last of which provided for the confiscation of Māori land whenever the Governor in Council was satisfied that ""any native tribe, or section of tribe or any considerable number thereof"", had been engaged in rebellion against the authority of the Queen. More particularly, the Act was passed into law to provide ""permanent protection and security of the well-disposed Inhabitants of both races for the prevention of future insurrection or rebellion and for the establishment and maintenance of Her Majesty's authority in Law and Order throughout the Colony"". In order to achieve those two broad ends, the Crown proposed introducing settlers into the regions by confiscating land and allotting or selling it to military and other settlers. The returns from the sales of land to settlers were also intended to recoup the Crown's costs of the wars against Māori:
    
    (21) The British Colonial Office had misgivings about the scope and application of the New Zealand Settlements Act 1863, considering it ""capable of great abuse"". When initially considering the proposal to confiscate lands the Colonial Secretary cautioned the Governor to respect the lands of innocent people and tribes and to apportion the measure of punishment to the degree of guilt. When it later considered the confiscation legislation, the British Colonial Office continued to express serious reservations about the use of the Act and its duration but allowed it to remain in operation because final authority for any confiscation remained with the Governor. The Colonial Secretary instructed the Governor to withhold his consent to any confiscation which was not ""just and moderate"":
    
    ###### Te Kaokaoroa
    
    (22) In 1864, according to the traditions of Ngāti Awa, certain hapū of Ngāti Awa, including Te Patutatahi, Ngāti Hikakino, Ngai Te Rangihouhiri II, and some members of Te Tawera and others joined a combined force of various Mātaatua and related iwi which came to be known as the Tai Rawhiti force. This force was destined for the Waikato region to lend assistance to the Waikato tribes who were resisting the unjust invasion of their lands by Crown and colonial forces. It was prevented from travelling through the Rotorua region by a Te Arawa prohibition on armed parties moving through its territory. A number of Te Arawa iwi had sought, and gained, Crown support in this undertaking. A Tai Rawhiti party fought against various Te Arawa iwi in February 1864 at Rotoiti which resulted in loss of life. However, part of this group did proceed to Orakau, in the Waikato region:
    
    (23) The Tai Rawhiti force made a second attempt to break through at the Waihi estuary, Maketu, in April 1864\. Certain Te Arawa iwi, supported by Crown warships and military personnel, repulsed the force. The fighting culminated in the battle of Te Kaokaoroa where Ngāti Awa, particularly Ngāti Hikakino and Ngai Te Rangihouhiri II, and allied hapū and iwi suffered numerous casualties. Several key chiefs of Ngāti Awa were among those lost:
    
    ###### James Te Mautaranui Fulloon
    
    (24) In late 1864, Kereopa, Horomona, and Patara, prophets of Pai Marire, arrived in the Whakatāne region and persuaded a number of Ngāti Awa to join Pai Marire. In March 1865, the Reverend Carl Volkner, a missionary living in Opotiki, was killed by local Māori some of whom were influenced by Pai Marire. On 6 March 1865, Ngāti Awa chiefs at Whakatāne expressed strong disapproval of the killing, but also stated that the Crown should not come through their territory while apprehending those responsible for killing Volkner. No military force was authorised by the Government to pursue Volkner's killers through Ngāti Awa territory:
    
    (25) In February 1865, after a series of runanga, certain chiefs of Ngāti Awa met at Whakatāne and resolved to place an aukati (customary prohibitive measure) about their territory to prevent encroachment into their rohe. Then in July 1865, following a series of hui at Tauaroa and Matata, the Pai Marire prophet Horomona and certain Ngāti Awa chiefs who supported him declared a second aukati. This aukati ran from Cape Runaway in the east to Taranaki in the west. On 19 or 20 July 1865, the _Maruiwi_, a Te Arawa trading vessel, arrived at Whakatāne. The vessel was seized for breaching the Pai Marire aukati and its crew was held at Whakatāne. On 22 July 1865, the _Kate_, carrying Crown official James Fulloon and others, arrived at Whakatāne. Fulloon, of Ngāti Awa descent, and three of the crew were killed on board by Ngāti Awa supporters of Pai Marire. Wepiha Apanui of the Whakatāne section of Ngāti Awa then arranged for the burial of his first cousin Hemi (James) Fulloon. There are various explanations for Fulloon's death; Ngāti Awa attribute Fulloon's death to his breach of the aukati. These events evoked various reactions among the hapū of Ngāti Awa:
    
    ###### The warrant
    
    (26) On 2 August 1865, T H Smith, as Civil Commissioner at Maketu, issued a warrant for the arrest of those persons alleged to have been responsible for killing Fulloon and others:
    
    (27) The people who were subject to the warrant were:

    (28) In August 1865, a Crown force of some 500 men was formed. It was drawn primarily from certain neighbouring iwi and hapū, many of whom were the traditional foes of Ngāti Awa and who had been involved in the battle at Te Kaokaoroa. The Crown force, under the command of Major William Mair, Resident Magistrate, entered the rohe of Ngāti Awa to execute the arrest warrant. The purpose of this expedition was explained to Te Hura Te Taiwhakaripi, a Ngāti Awa chief, in mid-August. The Crown force was involved in skirmishes with Ngāti Awa in which some people were killed. Cattle, horses, and other Ngāti Awa property were seized and kainga, wharenui, pataka, and waka were destroyed. This force laid siege to Ngāti Awa pā at Whakatāne, Matata, and Te Teko to which Te Hura and his force had retreated:
    
    (29) On 2 September 1865, the Crown issued a Proclamation of Peace declaring that the war, which had begun at Oakura in Taranaki in 1863, was at an end. The Proclamation of Peace stated that those who had been in arms against the Crown would not be prosecuted for past offences, but excluded those responsible for the killing of Fulloon. The Proclamation stated that if those responsible for the killing of Fulloon were not given up to the Governor then the Crown would take parts of the lands of those tribes who concealed the murderers. It also called for Māori assistance in stopping all future acts of violence and declared an intention to consult with the great Chiefs about the best means for Māori to be represented in the General Assembly so that they could help make the laws they were called on to obey:
    
    (30) On 4 September 1865, the Governor issued a proclamation of martial law in the areas of Whakatāne and Opotiki to enable the capture of those accused of the murder of Fulloon and others through the use of military force and to enable them to be tried by court martial. Martial law was to operate in the areas from that time until duly revoked and the proclamation implied that the Crown forces could act as a military force. Both these proclamations appeared in the _New Zealand Gazette_ on 5 September 1865\. It is unclear, however, when Ngāti Awa became aware of these proclamations:
    
    ###### Te Kupenga
    
    (31) There was an increase in Crown military activity at the end of September. This culminated in 3 days of fighting at Te Kupenga Pā, Te Teko. Eventually, on 20 October 1865, those Ngāti Awa hapū under the leadership of Te Hura Te Taiwhakaripi surrendered at Te Kupenga. They included Te Tawera, Warahoe, Ngai Te Rangihouhiri II, Te Patutatahi, Ngāti Hikakino, and others. Over 30 men, including most of those Ngāti Awa named in the warrant and some others, were placed under arrest and transported to Opotiki for trial by courts martial in November 1865 for the killing of Fulloon and other charges. The courts martial found many of the accused guilty and sentenced them to death:
    
    ###### Trials
    
    (32) On 23 December 1865 James Prendergast, the Attorney-General, provided an opinion on the trial by court martial of the prisoners taken at Opotiki. Prendergast determined that martial law was ""in no way recognised by the law"". As a consequence the Governor then ordered that the Ngāti Awa accused be transported to Auckland to be tried again, this time before the Supreme Court for murder and other charges. The 35 Ngāti Awa accused were all represented by a single legal counsel:
    
    (33) The following men were charged with piracy and the murders of Fulloon and seaman Ned on board the _Kate_: Mikaere Kirimangu, Te Hekara, Himone te Auru, Paraharaha, Hoani Poururu, Hoani Hupe, Utuku te Rangi, Te Aka o Tau te Hura, Hunia Marupo, Haki Waihou, Haki Tukino, Tamati o Ngāti Hoko, Tio Wahu, Hawera te Hihira, Heahea te Pakihiwi, and Raniera te Werotokotoko. Three of these men were found innocent on the piracy charge but all were found guilty of murder. Ten other men were charged with being accessories before the fact to the murders. They were Te Hura Te Tai, Te Pitoiwi Te Putarera, Hepeta Te Tai, Horomona Poropiti, Mohi Te Paohi, Te Hemara, Hakaraia Tohora, Te Uwhi Te Haraki, Kereama Toitoi, and Ture Te Matutaera. Six men were also charged with receiving stolen goods from the _Kate_. By 23 March 1866, all those tried before the Court were found guilty on at least 1 charge and were sentenced to execution or imprisonment. Mikaere Kirimangu and Horomona Poropiti (Taranaki) were executed for the murder of Fulloon on 17 May 1866\. Eleven of the men sentenced to death had their sentences commuted to life imprisonment and the other death sentences were commuted to between 4 and 14 years' penal servitude. Those charged with receiving stolen goods were sentenced to 3 years' hard labour. In 1867 and 1868 pardons were issued to some of these men but most served out their terms. Three men died while in prison, namely Tamati o Ngāti Hoko (1 August 1866), Hepeta Te Tai (26 November 1866), and Paraharaha (18 December 1866). Those who died in prison were interred without ceremony in the prison grounds. After regular requests over the generations their remains were released for reinterment with their families in 1988:
    
    (34) Ngāti Awa say that many of those who were eventually released were unable to return to their homes in Whakatāne and Matata because of the shame they felt as a consequence of their imprisonment and the confiscation. They lived in the King Country with Te Kooti Rikirangi under the protection of Ngāti Maniapoto. Most of them died and were buried outside of the rohe of Ngāti Awa but were eventually exhumed and reinterred at Ohuirehe Urupa near Whakatāne by Te Kooti Rikirangi and his followers in 1885:
    
    ###### Confiscation
    
    (35) By Orders in Council on 17 January and 1 September 1866, approximately 448 000 acres of land was proclaimed to be confiscated under the New Zealand Settlements Act 1863 as a consequence of Bay of Plenty tribes being deemed by the Crown to have been in rebellion. The Act did not mention punishment but was punitive in nature:
    
    (36) The boundaries of the confiscated area were:
    
    "_All that land bounded by a line commencing at the mouth of the Waitahanui River, Bay of Plenty, and running due south for a distance of 20 miles; then to the summit of (Mt Edgecombe) Putanaki \[sic\], thence by a straight line in an easterly direction to a point 11 miles due south from the entrance to the Ōhiwa Harbour, thence by a line running due east for 25 miles; thence by a line to the mouth of the Aparapara \[sic\] River and thence following the coastline to the point of commencement at Waitahanui_".
    
    (37) Within the area covered by the proclamation Ngāti Awa had approximately 245 000 acres of its land confiscated in 1866\. This was indiscriminate in that the lands taken greatly exceeded the minimum necessary for achieving the purposes of the New Zealand Settlements Act:
    
    (38) The confiscation of land affected all Ngāti Awa hapū, including many hapū who had never been engaged in any conflict with the Crown. The result was that all of the hapū of Ngāti Awa then had to go through the Compensation Court and other processes to seek the return of their land:
    
    ###### Wilson's arrangements and the Compensation Court
    
    (39) In February 1866, prior to the sitting of the Compensation Court, the Crown appointed a special commissioner, John A Wilson, to deal with the allocation of confiscated lands in the Bay of Plenty. Wilson was involved in making arrangements with various hapū for the return of land. Military awards for services rendered were made to certain Te Arawa iwi and other tribes from the 87 000 acre blocks west of the Tarawera River, which included the bulk of the area Ngāti Awa claim as their western rohe (other iwi also claim an interest in this area). By 1885 the Crown had purchased most of this land. Wilson's arrangements provided for the return of approximately 77 000 acres awarded to Ngāti Awa individuals in the form of reserves. This land was part of the 245 000 acres originally confiscated from the iwi in 1866:
    
    (40) Wilson's activities were carried out under the provisions of the New Zealand Settlements Act 1863 and its amendments. In order to validate his arrangements, the Crown then enacted further legislation including the Confiscated Lands Act 1867, the Richmond Land Sales Act 1870, the Whakatāne Grants Validation Act 1878, and the Native Land Claims and Boundaries Adjustments and Titles Empowering Act 1894:
    
    (41) The Compensation Court was established by the New Zealand Settlements Act 1863 to compensate anyone who had suffered land confiscation when they had not been in ""rebellion"". The Court began its hearings in the region in March 1867\. The presiding judges were William Mair and Thomas Smith, both of whom played important roles in either leading or directing the Crown's expeditionary force prior to confiscation. In many cases, the Court validated Wilson's arrangements as out of court settlements:
    
    (42) Those Ngāti Awa not wishing to settle with Wilson filed claims with the Court but those who could not attend the Court to pursue their claims, especially those who had been imprisoned in 1866, were inevitably excluded. In several cases non-attendance at court hearings was due to inadequate notice, the inability of claimants to attend and hearings being held outside of the rohe of Ngāti Awa:
    
    (43) Although Māori claimants were required to comply with Compensation Court processes or be excluded, in 1866 Parliament retrospectively declared the Court's own actions and proceedings to be valid and beyond judicial scrutiny, even if statutory requirements had not been met:
    
    (44) Ngāti Awa were subsequently excluded by the compensation process from those blocks falling within the confiscation line and the western part of the Ngāti Awa rohe, namely Matata Lots 31, 39, and 63\. These lands comprised an area in excess of 50 000 acres and made up the bulk of the western rohe claimed by Ngāti Awa. In the case of Matata Lot 63 Ngāti Awa witnesses gave a large amount of evidence and were supported by members of certain Te Arawa iwi. Despite this, the Court awarded this lot to another iwi who had given military service to the Crown. There was no provision for appeal from the decisions of the Court:
    
    (45) The compensation process and its outcomes added to the upheaval and distress of the people of Ngāti Awa about the confiscation. There was uncertainty about who was entitled to claim compensation from the Court. It often took up to 10 years before a Crown grant was issued for the land returned. Some hapū received land that was previously occupied by other hapū and the Whakatāne section of Ngāti Awa also had to accept members of other hapū onto their lands, including those from the Matata region who had been more directly involved in the battles of 1864 and 1865\. A large proportion of the land that Wilson had arranged for return was mountainous, barren country. Once land was restored either through Wilson's arrangements or the Compensation Court process, it was returned to individuals rather than to the hapū and iwi. The awards did not reflect customary forms of land tenure and the land became more susceptible to sale:
    
    (46) In future years Ngāti Awa's interests in the blocks to the west of the confiscation line were not recognised in the awards of the Native Land Court. Ngāti Awa consider that, because of the events of 1865 to 1867, including the determinations of the Compensation Court, they were prejudiced in later Native Land Court cases involving these blocks:
    
    ###### The operations of the native land laws, subsequent purchases, and other alienations
    
    (47) The Native Land Court was established under the Native Land Acts of 1862 and 1865 to determine the owners of Māori land ""according to Native Custom"" and to convert customary title into title derived from the Crown. The Crown's pre-emptive right of land purchase was also set aside, enabling Māori to lease and sell their lands with few restrictions. As was often the case in the 1860s, there was limited consultation concerning this legislation, and the Crown did not specifically consult Ngāti Awa. Māori had no direct representation in Parliament at this time. Ngāti Awa therefore considers that this change in the land tenure system was imposed on them:
    
    (48) In the 1870s Crown land purchase agents were instructed to purchase land in the Rangitaiki area and sometimes negotiated leases and deeds of transfer prior to the land being taken to the Native Land Court for title investigation. During the 1870s, 1880s, and 1890s Ngāti Awa made claims to lands south of the confiscation line. Their claims to Ruatoki and Kaingaroa blocks were not upheld by the Court. The Native Land Court awarded Ngāti Awa hapū interests in the Pokohu, Putauaki, Matahina, Waiohau, and Tuararangaia blocks over this period. In most cases the Court also awarded parts of these land blocks, regarded by Ngāti Awa as theirs, to other iwi. The Crown later ordered rehearings into some of the blocks by way of legislation. As a result, Ngāti Awa lost some of the land they had originally been awarded at Pokohu and Matahina:
    
    (49) The Court awarded Ngāti Awa approximately 79 000 acres in the Matahina block after a title investigation hearing in 1881\. A rehearing was held in 1884 and Ngāti Awa were awarded a reduced area of approximately 74 300 acres. An area of 8 500 acres of this was immediately taken by the Crown in payment of a survey lien. Native Land Court awards were made in the names of individuals and while Ngāti Awa managed to retain most of the land awarded to them for some time, the process of individualising and partitioning of interests accelerated in the 20th century. This resulted in substantial fragmentation and as a consequence many private sales occurred throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries. By 1980 Ngāti Awa's interests in the Matahina block had been reduced to 240 acres in Matahina A1D1\. Ngāti Awa consider the loss of this block a significant grievance, which is encapsulated in the waiata _Tangi mo Matahina_:
    
    (50) Putauaki is the tipuna maunga of all Ngāti Awa. Putauaki was bisected by the confiscation boundary and, consequently, the northern portion of the maunga was awarded to Te Pahipoto and Nga Maihi by the Compensation Court in 1867\. The southern portion of the maunga was within the Putauaki block. An agreement for the sale of the block, subject to conditions, was arranged between Crown purchase agents and some Ngāti Awa in 1879 but title to the block was not investigated by the Native Land Court until 1881\. The Court awarded the block to Ngāti Awa and the iwi requested the land be made inalienable. Ten days later, however, on a request from 2 Ngāti Awa chiefs, Rangitukehu and Penetito, the Court divided the block into 3 parts. The largest block was vested in 15 individuals and immediately sold to the Crown. Within days, 27 Ngāti Awa men, women, and children petitioned the Native Minister protesting the alienation of the block. Those involved in the sale later requested that the Crown return this and other blocks in exchange for a refund of the purchase money but the Crown did not agree. The remainder of the block, which included the maunga, was awarded to various individuals of Ngāti Awa and other iwi and ceased to be a tribal asset as a consequence of this process of individualisation. Ngāti Awa consider the alienation of Putauaki through various processes in the 19th and 20th centuries to be a significant grievance:
    
    (51) Ngāti Awa also lost land through acquisitions under public works legislation in the 20th century, including blocks in the Rangitaiki, Poroporo-Rewatu, Matahina, Whakatāne, and Matata areas. There were urupa, other wāhi tapu, and papakainga on some of the lands taken:
    
    (52) Ngāti Awa have sought justice for the wrongs inflicted on the iwi by the Crown since 1867\. Numerous petitions were sent to the Crown relating to the confiscations, imprisonments, and the loss of land over many generations. Ngāti Awa's case was heard before the Sim Commission in 1927 but the Commission did not find in favour of the general Ngāti Awa claim. The Commission did, however, find that Ngai Te Rangihouhiri II and Ngāti Hikakino had been granted only a small area of land. This was later depleted by a taking under public works legislation and as a result these hapū were left with poor quality land which was insufficient to support them. The Commission recommended the award of some land at Matata, but this never eventuated:
    
    (53) As a result of the recommendations of the Sim Commission other iwi had annuities paid to them by the Crown, and Trust Boards were established for some raupatu iwi, but not for Ngāti Awa.

    *   (a) i hē te uta i ngā kupu ""tangata hara"" ki runga i te iwi o Ngāti Awa, ka mutu e kore e taea te kī i te whana rātou; a
    
    *   (b) i tangohia ngā whenua me ngā rawa o Ngāti Awa, i tangohia anō hoki ko te rangatiratanga o te iwi ki runga i aua mea; a
    
    *   (c) nā runga i te raupatu o ngā whenua o Ngāti Awa, i tino kaha te paheketanga o te oranga, te ōhanga me te whanaketanga o te iwi, ā, tāpae atu ko te rironga atu o ngā wāhi tapu, me te āheinga ki ngā rawa me ngā tuwheratanga ki te whanaketanga; a
    
    *   (d) i hē tana raupatu i ngā whenua o Ngāti Awa, he mahi mōrikarika, he takahitanga hoki i Te Tiriti o Waitangi me ōna mātāpono, ā, kīia ai e Ngāti Awa ""he mahi pokanoa"" tēnei.
    
    (4) E whakaae ana te Karauna:
        
    *   (a) nā te raupatu, i puta ko te whakatoihara, ā, nā ngā tūpuhitanga o Te Kōti Utunga kātahi ka hē rawa atu; a
    
    *   (b) i tukuna e Te Kōti Utunga ngā whenua ki ngā tāngata takitahi, āpa te iwi, te hapū rānei, waihoki, ehara tēnei i te whai i ngā tikanga tūturu mō te tiaki whenua. He mea uta kē ēnei tikanga ki runga i a Ngāti Awa, kāore i whāia ko ngā whakaaro ake o te iwi; a
    
    *   (c) he maha ngā wā, ko tā Te Kōti Utunga he whakamana noa i ngā whakaritenga o mua noa atu a tētahi āpiha Karauna e pā ana ki te tuku haere i te whenua i tēnei takiwā; a
    
    *   (d) he mahi pokanoa noa iho te raupatu haere i ngā whenua, nā te kore whakahoki ōna i ngā whenua katoa ki ērā i noho ki a ia; a
    
    *   (e) nā te hē o te hātepe utunga arā, te nekehanga o ngā hapū o Ngāti Awa, mai i ngā whenua kua roa kē e nōhia ana e rātou, ki ērā whenua o hapū kē, i kaha ake ai te raruraru i waenganui i ngā hapū; a

    (8) E whakaae ana te Karauna:
        
    *   (a) he wāhi nui ngā whenua me ngā rawa i tangohia i a Ngāti Awa, i roto i te oranga me te whanaketanga o tēnei whenua, i te wā e noho whenua kore ana, e kore e āhei ana a Ngāti Awa ki ngā painga mai i aua whenua me aua rawa. Nā tēnei kore mana, kua raruraru a Ngāti Awa me tana whanaketanga taha ōhanga, taha hapori, taha tikanga hoki. Kua raruraru hoki a Ngāti Awa i te kore tarea e ia te uhi i tōna mana ki runga i ōna taonga, i ōna wāhi tapu, me te whakapūmau i ngā hononga wairua ki aua whenua tuku iho; a
    
    *   (b) E aronui ana, e mihi ana te Karauna ki te wāhi ki a Ngāti Awa i roto i ngā whawhai mō te whenua nei, i roto hoki i ngā pakanga o Niu Tīreni ki tāwāhi; a

##### 8 Text of acknowledgements in English
    
*   The text of the acknowledgements in English as set out in the Ngāti Awa deed of settlement is as follows:
    
    (1) The Crown acknowledges that Ngāti Awa have sought redress since 1867, that despite previous efforts made in the 20th century it has failed to deal with the grievances of Ngāti Awa in an appropriate way, and that recognition of these grievances is long overdue. The Crown hereby recognises the legitimacy of the Ngāti Awa historical claims and makes the following acknowledgements.
    
    (2) The Crown acknowledges:
        
    *   (a) that Ngāti Awa suffered loss of life and destruction of property during the Crown's expedition to arrest those involved in the murders of Fulloon and others; and
    
    *   (b) the sense of grievance suffered by Ngāti Awa in relation to the arrests, trials, imprisonment, and execution of leaders of Ngāti Awa hapū; and
    
    *   (c) that the remains of the Ngāti Awa men who died in prison were interred without ceremony within the prison walls and were not returned to their whānau until 1988; and
    
    *   (d) the destructive effect of these events on the social structure, mana, and rangatiratanga of the hapū involved who were rendered both landless and leaderless.
    
    (3) The Crown acknowledges that:
        
    *   (a) Ngāti Awa as an iwi were not in rebellion and were unfairly labelled as ""rebels"" and ""tangata hara""; and
    
    *   (b) Ngāti Awa were deprived of tribal land and resources within the confiscation area and were unable to exercise rangatiratanga over them; and
    
    *   (c) the confiscation of Ngāti Awa tribal land had a devastating effect on the welfare, economy, and development of Ngāti Awa and deprived the iwi of its many wāhi tapu, access to its natural resources, and opportunities for development; and
    
    *   (d) its confiscation of Ngāti Awa land was unjust, unconscionable, and a breach of the Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti o Waitangi) and its principles, and was described by Ngāti Awa as ""he mahi pokanoa---an act without reason"".
    
    (4) The Crown acknowledges that:
        
    *   (a) the prejudice created by the confiscation was compounded by inadequacies in the Compensation Court; and
    
    *   (b) the Compensation Court awarded land to individuals rather than iwi or hapū, which was not consistent with customary tenure. This system was imposed on Ngāti Awa and their views were not sought; and
    
    *   (c) in many cases the Compensation Court validated prior arrangements made by a Crown official regarding the distribution of land in this area; and
    
    *   (d) the confiscations were indiscriminate because of the Court's failure to return land in full to those considered to be loyal; and
    
    *   (e) the compensation process relocated Ngāti Awa hapū from land they had traditionally occupied and cultivated, to land that belonged to other Ngāti Awa hapū which further exacerbated traditional tensions between those hapū; and
    
    *   (f) Ngāti Awa land, including wāhi tapu, was awarded to other iwi who then frequently alienated those lands soon after; and
    
    *   (g) these actions eroded the traditional social structures, mana, and rangatiratanga of Ngāti Awa. The Crown failed to adequately protect Ngāti Awa from the impact of these actions, and this was a breach of the Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti o Waitangi) and its principles.
    
    (5) The Crown acknowledges that:
        
    *   (a) following the vesting of title under native land laws, Ngāti Awa land holdings, comprising land returned after the confiscation and land outside the confiscation boundaries, were further reduced by:
            
        *   (i) the taking of land for payment of survey liens; and
        
        *   (ii) Crown purchases and other sales; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) the operation and impact of the native land laws, in particular the awarding of land to individual Ngāti Awa rather than to iwi or hapū, made those lands more susceptible to partition, fragmentation, and alienation. This contributed to the further erosion of the traditional tribal structures of Ngāti Awa which were based on collective tribal and hapū custodianship of land. The Crown failed to take steps to adequately protect those structures. This had a prejudicial effect on Ngāti Awa, and was a breach of the Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti o Waitangi) and its principles.
    
    (6) The Crown acknowledges that land was also acquired from Ngāti Awa under public works legislation that allowed for the compulsory taking of land if agreement could not be reached.
    
    (7) The Crown acknowledges that the cumulative effect of the Crown's actions and omissions, particularly its failure to actively protect Ngāti Awa interests in the land Ngāti Awa wished to retain, left Ngāti Awa virtually landless. The Crown's failure to ensure that Ngāti Awa were left with sufficient land for their present and future needs was a breach of the Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti o Waitangi) and its principles.
    
    (8) The Crown acknowledges that:
        
    *   (a) the ancestral lands and resources alienated from Ngāti Awa have made a significant contribution to the wealth and development of the nation, whilst Ngāti Awa has been alienated from and deprived of the benefits of those lands and resources. This loss of control over land has prejudiced Ngāti Awa and hindered its economic, social, and cultural development. It has also impeded the ability of Ngāti Awa to exercise control over its taonga and wāhi tapu and to maintain and foster spiritual connections with those ancestral lands; and
    
    *   (b) the Crown also acknowledges, and pays tribute to, the contribution that Ngāti Awa has made to the defence of the nation in New Zealand's war efforts overseas; and
    
    *   (c) the suffering and hardship resulting from the Crown's actions is described by Ngāti Awa in the following waiata:
    
    Here I live as an orphan, an orphan upon the land, an orphan among the people. At night I weep helplessly, for where is hospitality to be given?

    (6) E tino pōuri ana, e tino whakapāha ana te Karauna i te mea kua kotahi rau tau e mau ana te kōrero ki runga i a Ngāti Awa iwi, he ""tangata hara"" rātou; nā ēnei āhuatanga te mana o te iwi i hahau.
    
    (7) E tino pōuri ana, e tino whakapāha ana te Karauna mō ngā rerekētanga me ngā paheketanga i pā kino mai ki te ora, ki te taha ōhanga me te pakari o te tū a Ngāti Awa hei iwi.
    
    (8) E tino pōuri ana, e tino whakapāha ana te Karauna i tana kore aro atu ki te mana me te rangatiratanga o Ngāti Awa.
    
    (9) Na reira, i runga i ngā kupu o te whakapāha nei, e rapu ana te Karauna kia ea ēnei mahi hē āna, kia tīmata ngā mahi whakaora; i tua atu, ko tōna hiahia, ki te hanga whakapakari i tētahi hononga e takea mai ana i runga i te wairua whakawhirinaki, tētahi ki tētahi, me te wairua mahi tahi me Ngāti Awa.

##### 10 Text of apology in English
    
*   The text of the apology in English as set out in the Ngāti Awa deed of settlement is as follows:
    
    (1) The Crown formally apologises to Ngāti Awa as set out in subsections (2) to (9).
    
    (2) The Crown recognises the efforts and struggles of the ancestors of Ngāti Awa in pursuit of their claims for redress, justice, and compensation against the Crown for over 130 years, and makes this apology to them, their descendants, and nga uri o nga hapū o Ngāti Awa whanui.
    
    (3) The Crown profoundly regrets and apologises unreservedly for the breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti o Waitangi) and its principles acknowledged above.
    
    (4) The Crown profoundly regrets and unreservedly apologises for the confiscation of Ngāti Awa lands which was unconscionable.
    
    (5) The Crown profoundly regrets and unreservedly apologises for the cumulative effect of its actions over the generations which has left Ngāti Awa virtually landless, and which has undermined the social and traditional structures and autonomy of Ngāti Awa hapū.
    
    (6) The Crown regrets that Ngāti Awa as an iwi have borne the century old stigma of being labelled 'rebels' and 'tangata hara' and that this has damaged the self-esteem of the people.
    
    (7) The Crown profoundly regrets and unreservedly apologises for the destructive impact and demoralising effects of its actions which have caused significant damage to the welfare, economy, and development of Ngāti Awa as an iwi.
    
    (8) The Crown profoundly regrets its failure to acknowledge the mana and rangatiratanga of Ngāti Awa.
    
    (9) Accordingly, with this apology, the Crown seeks to atone for these wrongs and begin the process of healing and looks forward to building a relationship of mutual trust and co-operation with Ngāti Awa.

## Schedule 4  
Statutory acknowledgement for Koohi Point (Kohi Point)

[s 40][60]

#### Statutory area

The area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies (statutory area) is the area known as Koohi Point, as shown on SO 61401, South Auckland Land District.

#### Preamble

Under [section 40][60], the Crown acknowledges Ngāti Awa's statement of its cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association to Koohi Point as set out below.

#### Cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association of Ngāti Awa with statutory area

It is the historical traditions of Ngāti Awa that illustrate the relationship of Ngāti Awa to Koohi Point Scenic Reserve. For Ngāti Awa, traditions such as these represent the links between the world of the gods and present generations. These histories reinforce tribal identity, solidarity, and continuity between generations and document the events which shaped the environment of Koohi Point and Ngāti Awa as an iwi.

Ngāti Awa has resided at Koohi Point since the time of the ancestor Tīwakawaka, many generations before the arrival of the Mātaatua waka at Whakatāne. Tīwakawaka was the first explorer to discover and settle the land around Kākahoroa (Whakatāne). His waka was Te Aratauwhāiti and his descendants were the original people of Kākahoroa. Some of the crew of Te Aratauwhāiti are commemorated in the names of the rocks at Koohi Point.

Twelve generations from Tīwakawaka came the ancestor Toi te Huatahi. Toi resided at Kāpūterangi Pā which is located above the Koohi Point Scenic Reserve. On the arrival of Hoaki and Taukata to the area in search of their sister, Kanioro, they were treated to a feast consisting of fern root, berries, and other forest foods. Upon tasting these foods they took an instant dislike to them, remarking that it was just like eating wood. It was from this event that Toi became known as Toi-kai-rākau (Toi the vegetarian). Hoaki and Taukata asked for a bowl of water in which they added dried preserved kūmara or kao and asked their hosts to taste it. Having tasted this delicious kai they desired to have more of it. A canoe was built from driftwood log (tāwhaowhao) and named accordingly Te Ara Tāwhao. Tama ki Hikurangi was chosen to captain the canoe to go in search of the source of the kūmara. These events occurred near Te Haehaenga, the beach immediately below Koohi near the Whakatāne River.

A significant event in the history of Ngāti Awa was the arrival of the waka Mātaatua, captained by Toroa, the chief of Mātaatua and one of the principal ancestors of Ngāti Awa. Mātaatua faced rough waters as it approached the headland at Whakatāne (Koohi Point). The turbulence was so bad that it caused the daughter of Toroa, Wairaka, to suffer the indignity of experiencing sea sickness. The term by which Ngāti Awa tipuna later called this experience was ""kō-hī"" (to be ill). Hence the name by which the rocks, the point, and adjacent land is known today.

The name Koohi is well known in the traditions of Ngāti Awa and appears in several waiata and in the following well known proverb:
    
*   _Ngā mate i Koohi me tangi mai i Kawerau, ngā mate o_

*   _Kawerau me tangi atu i Koohi._

*   _The deaths at Koohi will be wept over at Kawerau and the deaths at Kawerau will be wept over at Koohi._

Ngāti Awa have traditionally regarded the Koohi Point Rocks as toka tipua (rocks imbued with spiritual and sacred qualities) and the places as papanga tawhito (ancient sites of traditional significance). Ngāti Awa tipuna used the naming of the rocks at Koohi to record significant events and rangatira throughout their history. The Koohi Point Rocks have been personalised with the names of some of those involved in the Mātaatua canoe's lengthy ocean passage. The Koohi Point Rocks are made up of a number of different rocks, some of which are referred to here to signify the importance of the Koohi Point Scenic Reserve and contiguous coastal area to Ngāti Awa. All the Koohi Point Rocks, aside from Hine-tū-aho-anga, Hī-moki, and Toka-tapu, are owned by Ngāti Awa.

Hi-moki is in the mouth of the Whakatāne River and was regarded as a very significant fishing spot. The next Koohi Point Rock is Hine-tū-aho-anga, named after a woman who was a leader of the sandstone people back in the ancient lands of Hawaiki. This rock was used for sharpening tools in ancient times.

To the west of Koohi Pā is Te Puke a Hawaiki, also known as Hingarae or Sugar Loaf Rock. This rock was named after an accident where a rangatira slipped and hit his forehead. Next to Hingarae are Te Toka Koakaroa, commonly referred to as Koakaroa, which is the traditional name of the entrance to the Whakatāne River, and Areiawa. The latter is submerged in the channel of the 2 former rocks and is historically known as the guardian rock of the Whakatāne River. Sited amongst these rocks is Toka Kuku-pōniania, commonly referred to as Niania Rock. Niania is a species of mussel commonly found in the area.

Kōpua Huruhuru is an area of water north-east of Te Puke a Hawaiki and encompasses the shoreline and bed of rocks north of it. This area was well known as a harvesting place for seafood. Below the very point of this headland are Koohi Point and Rukupō rocks. The latter rock is significant in Ngāti Awa mythology in that it was here that the famous tohunga Te Tahinga o te Rangi rested when he returned from Whakāri (White Island).

On the eastern coastline of Koohi Point Scenic Reserve is Te Toka o te Rua o te Ika (Fish Hole), a bay renowned by Ngāti Awa for the varieties of fish that dwell there. In the middle of this bay is a rock island of the same name. Located off its eastern point is a submerged rock called Whakāri of the same name as the island volcano. Whakāri and the adjourning bay, Pipiko, are popular nesting areas for the grey-faced petrel commonly known as muttonbird or tītī. The area was also a popular spot from which Ngāti Awa people collected kaimoana including koura, paua, and kina. Paparoa and Ōtarawairere are also areas on the eastern side of Koohi Point Scenic Reserve that were well known as recreational sites for the collection of seafood.

The particular Ngāti Awa hapū who lived on and around the lands of the Koohi Point Scenic Reserve were Te Patutātahi or Ngai Taiwhakaea II, Ngāti Hokopū, and Ngāti Pūkeko (which was previously referred to as Ngai Tonu). Patutāhora and Ngāti Rangataua were divisions of Ngāti Pūkeko. Ngāti Wharepaia, a division of Ngāti Hokopū, and Te Patuwai also have historical and cultural connections to Koohi Point by virtue of their descent from the Ngāti Awa ancestors, Taiwhakaea I, Te Rangitipukiwaho I, Taiwhakaea II, Nukutaimehameha, Paiaka, Te Hemahema, Te Pūtārera, and Te Hāmaiwaho. Other hapū of the area included Ngāti Ikapuku, Ngāti Maumoana, Ngāti Hore, Ngāti Paeko, Ngāti Whakapoi, and Ngāti Whakahinga.

Ngāti Awa people occupied a number of pā sites at Koohi Point. Aside from Kāpūterangi, the famous pā of Toi, there was a neighbouring pā site called Ōrāhiri. Ōrāhiri derived its name from Rāhiri, the son of Puhi-moana-ariki, the brother of Toroa. Although there were other pā sites on Koohi Point during the time of Puhi and Toroa, Ōrāhiri was the only settlement with a chief, namely Puhi. Toroa himself lived on the flat lands below Koohi Point.

There was an instance during the kūmara planting season when Puhi, who lived at Koohi Point, being jealous of his older brother Toroa for holding the mana of Mātaatua as bestowed upon him by his father Irakewa, set out to insult his tuakana (older brother). After hearing the insult directed at him by his younger brother, Toroa reciprocated. Bitter resentment arose between the 2 brothers, with Puhi deciding to take the Mātaatua waka and seek a new home in the North.

Papa-Whāriki was another area of occupation by Ngāti Awa at Koohi Point. Papa-Whāriki overlooked Te Ana o Muriwai (Muriwai's Cave). There were three sites at Papa-Whāriki. Below this site, directly opposite Te Ana o Muriwai at the water front, once stood Irakewa Island. Irakewa was the father of Toroa. The island held a spiritual significance for Ngāti Awa as descendants of this ancestor.

Another pā at Koohi Point was Taumata Kahawai. The name of this pā signifies a lookout place for Kahawai. Taumata Kahawai was occupied by the chief Taiwhakaea I, founder of the hapū of Te Patutātahi or Ngai Taiwhakaea and of Ngāti Ikapuku. These hapū were responsible for observing the ocean and surrounding shores for possible invasion and shoals of fish.

Other pā sites within the Koohi Point Scenic Reserve include Te Rae o te Tāmure, Koohi, and Te Whakatere. Te Rae o te Tāmure Pā is situated on the ridge between Ōhope West and Ōtarawairere beach at Koohi Point. It runs north from the vicinity of Ōtarawairere down to the cliffs at the seaside edge of the ridge. Situated at the bottom of the cliff is a very important fishing rock called Whanga-pānui where snapper would gather in abundance (hence the name ""The Gathering Place of Snapper"").

There were other pā sites at Koohi Point, adjacent to the modern day Koohi Point Scenic Reserve. Pāpaka was located directly above Pōhaturoa Rock at Koohi Point. Opposite and south of Pāpaka is another well known pā site, Puketapu. To the east of Pāpaka and towards Te Wairere Falls were Koohinepipi and Tamatea-Iwi. Below these pā to the north-east was Kuharoa. Further Ngāti Awa pā at Koohi Point were Hauwai, Kuharua, Kāeaea, Pāhau, Tikotikorere, and Tirotiro Whetū. These were all settlements named and occupied by Ngāti Awa. The people of these pā also utitilised the abundant resources of the Koohi Point Scenic Reserve.

The various pā and other sites within and in the vicinity of Koohi Point Scenic Reserve demonstrate the general and special significance of the statutory area to Ngāti Awa. They show how the region has been occupied by Ngāti Awa hapū since the time of the Mātaatua waka and before.

The Ngāti Awa tipuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the Koohi Point area, the relationship of people with the area and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to the people of Ngāti Awa today.

Koohi Point Scenic Reserve is the repository of many kōiwi tangata, secreted away in places throughout the Reserve. Urupā are the resting places of Ngāti Awa tipuna and, as such, are the focus of whānau traditions. Urupā and wāhi tapu are places holding the memories, traditions, victories, and defeats of Ngāti Awa tipuna, and are frequently protected in secret locations.

The mauri of the coastal area represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāti Awa whānui to Koohi Point Scenic Reserve.

## Schedule 5  
Statutory acknowledgement for Mokorua Scenic Reserve

[s 40][60]

#### Statutory area

The area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies (statutory area) is the area known as Mokorua Scenic Reserve, as shown on SO 310381, South Auckland Land District.

#### Preamble

Under [section 40][60], the Crown acknowledges Ngāti Awa's statement of Ngāti Awa's cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association to Mokorua Scenic Reserve as set out below.

#### Cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association of Ngāti Awa with statutory area

The traditions of Ngāti Awa illustrate the cultural, historical, and spiritual association of Ngāti Awa to the Mokorua Scenic Reserve. For Ngāti Awa, traditions such as these represent the links between the world of the gods and present generations. These histories reinforce tribal identity, connection, and continuity between generations and confirm the importance of the Mokorua Scenic Reserve to Ngāti Awa.

According to Ngāti Awa traditions Tīwakawaka was the first explorer to discover and settle the land around Kākahoroa (Whakatāne). His waka was Te Aratauwhāiti and his descendants became known as Ngāti Ngainui. The descendants of Tīwakawaka are the original people of Kākahoroa. Twelve generations from Tīwakawaka came the ancestor Toi Te Huatahi. Toi resided at Kāpūterangi above Kākahoroa. Toi is acknowledged as the principal founding ancestor of many iwi including Ngāti Awa. Ngāti Awa history then records the arrival of the waka Mātaatua (the eye of the god) at Kākahoroa (Whakatāne) from the ancestral homeland Hawaiki. Many of the ancestors of Ngāti Awa on board Mātaatua and their descendants utilised the natural bounty of what is now known as the Mokorua Scenic Reserve.

Ngāti Awa from Whakatāne, Ngāti Pūkeko, Ngāti Hokopū, and Ngai Taiwhakaea II hapū of Ngāti Awa have resided in and around the lands of the Mokorua Scenic Reserve for many generations. Battle sites, urupā and landscape features bearing the names of tipuna record their history of occupation. The result of the struggles, alliances and marriages arising out of various inter-hapū disputes within Ngāti Awa was the eventual emergence of a stable, organised and, from time to time, united series of hapū located in and around the Mokorua Scenic Reserve area.

As recently as the mid-1800s the Mokorua Scenic Reserve was the centre of debate and conflict between tribes stemming from a plan to establish a flour mill in the area. After the battles, Ngāti Awa continued to reside on the lands of the Mokorua Scenic Reserve.

The lands of the Mokorua Scenic Reserve were always regarded by Ngāti Awa, particularly the hapū of the Whakatāne area, as a valuable source of foods such as birds including the kererū. Ever since ancient times the lands of the Mokorua Scenic Reserve have been from time to time the cause of many disputes because of the abundant nature of the area for food gathering. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāti Awa whānui to the Mokorua Scenic Reserve.

The Ngāti Awa tipuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the Mokorua Scenic Reserve, the relationship of people with the area and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to the people of Ngāti Awa today.

The Mokorua Scenic Reserve is the repository of many kōiwi tangata, secreted away in places throughout the Reserve. Urupā are the resting places of Ngāti Awa tipuna and, as such, are the focus of whānau traditions. Urupā and wāhi tapu are places holding the memories, traditions, victories, and defeats of Ngāti Awa tipuna, and are frequently protected in secret locations.

#### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

Under [section 41][61], and without limiting the rest of this schedule, the purposes of this statutory acknowledgement are---
    
*   (a) to require that relevant consent authorities, the New Zealand Historic Places Trust, or the Environment Court, as the case may be, have regard to this statutory acknowledgement in relation to Mokorua Scenic Reserve, as provided in [sections 42 to 44][62]; and

*   (b) to require that relevant consent authorities forward summaries of resource consent applications to the Ngāti Awa governance entity as provided in [section 46][66]; and

*   (c) to enable the Ngāti Awa governance entity and any member of Ngāti Awa to cite this statutory acknowledgement as evidence of the association of Ngāti Awa to Mokorua Scenic Reserve as provided in [section 47][67].

#### Limitations on effect of statutory acknowledgement

Except as expressly provided in [sections 41 to 44][61] and [47][67],---
    
*   (a) this statutory acknowledgement does not affect, and is not to be taken into account in, the exercise of any power, duty, or function by any person or entity under any statute, regulation, or bylaw; and

*   (b) no person or entity, in considering any matter or making any decision or recommendation under any statute, regulation, or bylaw may give any greater or lesser weight to Ngāti Awa's association with Mokorua Scenic Reserve than that person or entity would give under the relevant statute, regulation, or bylaw, if this statutory acknowledgement had not been made.

Except as expressly provided in [subpart 3][58] of Part 4, this statutory acknowledgement does not affect the lawful rights or interests of any person who is not a party to the deed of settlement.

Except as expressly provided in [subpart 3][58] of Part 4, this statutory acknowledgement does not have the effect of granting, creating, or providing evidence of any estate or interest in, or any rights of any kind whatsoever relating to, Mokorua Scenic Reserve.

#### No limitation on the Crown

The existence of this statutory acknowledgement does not prevent the Crown from providing a statutory acknowledgement in respect of Mokorua Scenic Reserve to a person or persons other than Ngāti Awa or a representative entity.

## Schedule 6  
Statutory acknowledgement for Ōhope Scenic Reserve

[s 40][60]

#### Statutory area

The area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies (statutory area) is the area known as Ōhope Scenic Reserve, as shown on SO 61696, South Auckland Land District.

#### Preamble

Under [section 40][60], the Crown acknowledges Ngāti Awa's statement of Ngāti Awa's cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association to Ōhope Scenic Reserve as set out below.

#### Cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association of Ngāti Awa with statutory area

It is the historical traditions of Ngāti Awa such as whakapapa, waiata, kōrero, and whakairo that illustrate the cultural and spiritual association of Ngāti Awa to the Ōhope Scenic Reserve. These histories link the present generations of Ngāti Awa with their ancestors and the atua of the natural world such as Io-Matua-Kore, Ranginui, and Papatuanuku. These traditions form the foundation of the identity of Ngāti Awa as an iwi. Some of these important historical traditions are recorded below.

Ngāti Awa history records the arrival of the waka Mātaatua (the face of the god) at Kākahoroa (Whakatāne) from the ancestral homeland Hawaiki. Mātaatua brought the kūmara to Kākahoroa and a parcel of soil from Rangiātea to place in the garden called Matirerau. Toroa, the chief of Mātaatua, is acknowledged as one of the principal ancestors of Ngāti Awa. From Toroa came Ruaihona, from Ruaihona came Tahinga o Te rangi and from Tahinga o Te rangi came Awanuiārangi II. The eponymous ancestor Awanuiārangi II, great-grandson of Toroa, is acknowledged by Ngāti Awa as the paramount and principal identifying ancestor to which all hapū of Ngāti Awa can trace descent.

During the early occupation of Ōhope by Ngāti Awa, various hapū established the customary interests of the iwi. Following that, during the late 18th century 2 Ngāti Awa hapū, Ngāti Hokopū and Ngāti Wharepaia, were prominent within the Reserve and surrounding area.

A number of pā sites near the Ōhope Scenic Reserve illustrate the strong historical associations of Ngāti Awa to the Reserve. Western-most was Ōtūmanu Pā. Te Rae o Te Tāmure was nearby, on the ridge between Ōhope West and Ōtarawairere beach at Koohi Point. Both these pā were occupied by Tamaruarangi, a well-known rangatira and ancestor of Ngāti Awa. Further east, near the coast below the Ōhope Scenic Reserve were 2 key strategic pā called Maungateone Pā (Sand Mountain) and Te Paripari or Gunfighters' Pā. Further along Ōhope towards Ōhiwa were Mihi Marino Pā (Calm Greetings) and Raukawarua Pā. There were also pā within the Ōhope Scenic Reserve but their names have been lost over time.

The Ōhope Scenic Reserve was rich in resources and provided an abundance of wildlife, plant, and vegetation for the hapū of Ngāti Awa that lived within or near the Reserve. The Reserve was a favourite food gathering place for the hapū of Ngāti Awa. The use of the Reserve area has been evidenced by the discovery of artefacts along the creekbed of Te Huki o to Tuna (Spit of the Eel) in past years.

To ensnare some of the abundant bird life within the area known today as the Ōhope Scenic Reserve the people of the hapū would hollow out miro logs as drinking troughs for birds such as kererū and wait in hiding for them.

The medicinal qualities of the plant life in the Ōhope Scenic Reserve were also important to Ngāti Awa. These cultural aspects of the Reserve constitute an essential part of the heritage of Ngāti Awa. 

Particular stretches of the Ōhope Scenic Reserve also have their own traditions. West of Ōtumanu along the cliff face is the path known as Te Ara-kā which means the burning path or illuminated pathway. 

Ngāti Awa have always maintained a considerable knowledge of the lands of the Ōhope Scenic Reserve and surrounding area, its history, the traditional trails of the tipuna in the area, the places for gathering kai and other taonga, and the ways in which to use the resources of the Ōhope Scenic Reserve. Proper and sustainable resource management has always been at the heart of the relationship of Ngāti Awa with the Ōhope Scenic Reserve. The sustainable management of the resources of the reserve remains important to the people of Ngāti Awa today.

The Ōhope Scenic Reserve is the repository of many kōiwi tangata, secreted away in places throughout the reserve. These urupā are wāhi tapu and the knowledge of their location is often protected. Urupā provide an important link to the memories and traditions of Ngāti Awa tipuna and the protection of the relationship to those places is important to the spiritual wellbeing of the iwi.

The traditional values of mana, mauri, whakapapa, and tapu are central to the relationship of Ngāti Awa with the Ōhope Scenic Reserve. The mana of Ōhope describes the power and importance of the reserve to Ngāti Awa. Mana also implies the responsibility of Ngāti Awa as tangata whenua and guardians of the area. The mauri of Ōhope is the life force of Ōhope. All forms of life have a mauri and all forms of life are related. One of the roles of Ngāti Awa as tangata whenua is to protect the mauri of the Ōhope Scenic Reserve area. Whakapapa defines the genealogical relationship of Ngāti Awa to the Reserve. Tapu describes the sacred nature of the Reserve to Ngāti Awa. Mana, mauri, whakapapa, and tapu are all important spiritual elements of the relationship of Ngāti Awa with the Ōhope Scenic Reserve area. All of these values remain important to the people of Ngāti Awa today.

## Schedule 7  
Statutory acknowledgement for Moutohorā (Whale Island) Wildlife Management Reserve

[s 40][60]

#### Statutory area

The area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies (statutory area) is the area known as Moutohorā (Whale Island) Wildlife Management Reserve, as shown on SO 61405, South Auckland Land District.

#### Preamble

Under [section 40][60], the Crown acknowledges Ngāti Awa's statement of Ngāti Awa's cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association to Moutohorā (Whale Island) Wildlife Management Reserve as set out below.

#### Cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association of Ngāti Awa with statutory area

The traditions of Ngāti Awa illustrate the cultural, historical, and spiritual association of Ngāti Awa to Moutohorā. For Ngāti Awa, traditions such as these represent the links between the world of the gods and present generations. These histories reinforce tribal identity, connection, and continuity between generations and confirm the importance of Moutohorā to Ngāti Awa.

A significant event in the history of Ngāti Awa was the arrival of the waka Mātaatua to Aotearoa. Toroa, the chief of Mātaatua, is acknowledged as one of the principal ancestors of Ngāti Awa. The first occupation of Moutohorā was by the grandson of Toroa, Te-Rongo Tauaroa a Tai. Te Rongo lived at a pā called Raetihi (The Summit of Gentle Breezes), now known as Pā Hill. Some of the descendants of Rongo are found among the hapū of Ngāti Awa.

Moutohorā derives its name from the words Motu (island) and tohorā (whale). With the passage of time the name was shortened to Moutohorā. It was here that Captain Cook's first expedition described the only double-hulled war canoe that they saw during their expedition in Aotearoa. This confirms that in 1769 the Ngāti Awa hapū living at Moutohorā were using double-hulled waka for sea transport.

Taiwhakaea I, a noted chief of Ngāti Awa and eponymous ancestor of the Taiwhakaea hapū of Ngāti Awa, lived from time to time on Moutohorā. Te Ngārara, another Ngāti Awa rangatira, also made frequent use of the island.

There were a number of pā sites on Moutohorā that were used by the hapū of Ngāti Awa who occupied the Island. Raetihi is one such pā. The unusual feature of Raetihi is that it has stone walls on the lower north-eastern side of the pā. Moutohorā was occupied for relatively short periods of time when people travelled to the Island to gather food. Gathering tītī (mutton bird---grey faced petrels) and kaimoana from Moutohorā were regular seasonal activities for the Whakatāne based hapū of Ngāti Awa.

There are also a number of significant Ngāti Awa wāhi tapu on Moutohorā. Te Pari Kawau (Boulder Bay) was an ancient urupā of the hapū of Ngāti Awa. Another wāhi tapu on Moutohorā is Waiariki (Sulphur Bay). Separate areas at Waiariki were set aside for cooking, bathing, and medicinal purposes. Various Ngāti Awa people suffering from skin ailments and especially from hakihaki were able to go to the hot springs at Waiariki and bathe in the sulphur laden water. Te Puna Wai (The Water Spring) is a small spring on Moutohorā. Te Puna Wai was the only reliable source of fresh water. However, during a very dry summer it was necessary to carry additional water to Moutohorā from Whakatāne. Te Rātahi (McEwens Bay) was where the hapū of Ngāti Awa living on Moutohorā established their gardens and grew kūmara and other root vegetables.

The abundant resources of Moutohorā made it a valuable place to live for those hapū of Ngāti Awa fortunate enough to occupy the Island. The gathering of tītī was always a traditional and annual activity involving many of the hapū of Ngāti Awa. Ngāti Awa people used the cultural practice of rāhui to ensure the tītī were never depleted completely on the Island. Moutohorā was also useful as a lookout point to intercept any intruders who were en route to some other part of the eastern coast.

Moutohorā has always been a rich source of pāua, kina, crayfish, and the popular varieties of shellfish for the hapū of Ngāti Awa.

The Ngāti Awa tipuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of Moutohorā, the relationship of people with the area and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to the hapū of Ngāti Awa today.

Moutohorā is the repository of many kōiwi tangata. Urupā are the resting places of Ngāti Awa tipuna and, as such, are the focus of whānau traditions. Urupā and wāhi tapu are places holding the memories, traditions, victories, and defeats of Ngāti Awa tipuna, and are frequently protected in secret locations.

The mauri of Moutohorā represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāti Awa whānui to Moutohorā.

#### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

Under [section 41][61], and without limiting the rest of this schedule, the purposes of this statutory acknowledgement are---

*   (c) to enable the Ngāti Awa governance entity and any member of Ngāti Awa to cite this statutory acknowledgement as evidence of the association of Ngāti Awa to Moutohorā (Whale Island) Wildlife Management Reserve as provided in [section 47][67].

## Schedule 8  
Statutory acknowledgement for Part Ōhiwa Harbour

[s 40][60]

#### Statutory area

The area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies (statutory area) is Part Ōhiwa Harbour marked ""A"" on SO 61441, South Auckland Land District, being the foreshore, seabed, and coastal water (as those terms are defined in the [Resource Management Act 1991][264]) and the air space above the water and, where the boundary of the area marked ""A"" on SO 61441 is shown as a landward boundary, the landward boundary is the line of mean high water springs, except that where that line crosses a river, the landward boundary at that point is whichever is the lesser of---
    
*   (a) 1 kilometre upstream from the mouth of the river; or

*   (b) the point upstream that is calculated by multiplying the width of the river mouth by 5\.

#### Preamble

Under [section 40][60], the Crown acknowledges Ngāti Awa's statement of Ngāti Awa's cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association to Part Ōhiwa Harbour as set out below.

#### Cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association of Ngāti Awa with statutory area

The traditions of Ngāti Awa illustrate the cultural, historical, and spiritual association of Ngāti Awa to the Ōhiwa Harbour. For Ngāti Awa, traditions such as these represent the links between the world of the gods and present generations. These histories reinforce tribal identity, connection, and continuity between generations and confirm the importance of Ōhiwa Harbour to Ngāti Awa.

According to Ngāti Awa the first person to settle in the region was Maui. After him was Tīwakawaka. His descendant was Toi te Huatahi who was also known as Toi Kairākau. From Toi descended many tribes collectively known as Te Tini o Toi. Another of these ancient tribes was Te Hapūoneone, a division of Te Tini o Awa who occupied the lands around Ōhiwa. The harbour has always been a source of sustenance to those residing around the harbour, at pā such as Tauwhare, Te Horo, and Paparoa. The name Ōhiwa comes from Te Ōhiwa o Awanuiārangi II which means the standing place of Awanuiārangi II. The name arose when Awanuiārangi II stood on the summit of the pā site Paparoa at Wainui on the shores of Ōhiwa. Since then Awanuiārangi's descendants, the hapū of Ngāti Awa, have resided and maintained a presence at Ōhiwa Harbour.

There are a number of important Ngāti Awa pā sites and wāhi tapu in the Ōhiwa Harbour, which demonstrate Ngāti Awa connections with the harbour. Generations of Ngāti Awa have watched over Ōhiwa from such places. One such wāhi tapu was Te Horonga o Ngai Te Hapū (the bathing place of Te Hapū). Te Hapū was the son of Tāroakaikaha, the founding ancestor of the Patuwai hapū of Ngāti Awa who are now located at Pupuāruhe, Toroa Marae and Mōtiti Island. Te Horo, at the mouth of the Ōhiwa Harbour, was also an important settlement of Te Kooti and his Ngāti Awa followers. Taipari is a wāhi tapu also located at the mouth of the harbour near Te Horo. Taipari is the area where Ngāti Awa hapū would read the signs of the ocean, hence the name Taipari which means the rising and falling of the tides. Taipari is also the name of a chief of the Ngāti Awa hapū, Ngāti Hokopū. There are numerous other pā and wāhi tapu known to Ngāti Awa around the harbour.

Ngāti Awa from Whakatāne, Ngāti Hokopū, and Ngāti Wharepaia were instrumental in establishing and maintaining a Ngāti Awa presence at Ōhiwa Harbour. Several pā were destroyed in the many battles between Ngāti Awa and Whakatōhea until peace was finally made between the 2 tribes in 1857\. There were several minor incidents following the peace agreement regarding boundaries, but it is Ngāti Awa's tradition that a boundary between the iwi generally agreed at that time was to the Hokianga River in the Ōhiwa harbour. This boundary is still contested today. The Hokianga River, which winds its way through the harbour and out to sea, can only be seen at low tide.

The Ōhiwa harbour has provided Ngāti Awa hapū with all the resources of life they required to survive. The harbour provided an abundance of fish and shellfish such as flounder, kahawai, mussels, pipi, cockles, scallops, and oysters. The harbour was also rich in bird life and building material. The Ngāti Awa hapū, Ngāti Hokopū and Ngāti Wharepaia settled throughout the Ōhiwa Harbour. Ōtao was a favourite place of Ngāti Hokopū for gathering kaimoana particularly pipi, scallops, and cockles.

Throughout the years Ngāti Awa have exercised custodianship over the harbour and have imposed rāhui (temporary restrictions) when appropriate, restricting the taking of mussels, scallops, and other kaimōana. Proper and sustainable management of Ōhiwa Harbour has always been at the heart of the relationship of Ngāti Awa with the harbour.

Ōhiwa Harbour is the repository of many kōiwi tangata. Urupā are the resting places of Ngāti Awa tipuna and, as such, are the focus of whānau traditions. Urupā and wāhi tapu are places holding the memories, traditions, victories, and defeats of Ngāti Awa tipuna and are frequently protected in secret locations.

Ngāti Awa tipuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of Ōhiwa Harbour, the relationship of people with the area and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to the people of Ngāti Awa today.

The Ōhiwa Harbour is of great cultural and historical importance to Ngāti Awa. The mauri of Ōhiwa Harbour represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāti Awa whānui to the Ōhiwa Harbour.

## Schedule 9  
Statutory acknowledgement for Uretara Island

[s 40][60]

#### Statutory area

The area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies (statutory area) is the area known as Uretara Island, as shown on SO 61690, South Auckland Land District.

#### Preamble

##### 

Under [section 40][60], the Crown acknowledges Ngāti Awa's statement of Ngāti Awa's cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association to Uretara Island as set out below.

#### Cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association of Ngāti Awa with statutory area

It is the historical traditions of Ngāti Awa such as whakapapa, waiata, kōrero, and whakairo that illustrate the cultural and spiritual association of Ngāti Awa to Uretara Island. These histories link the present generations of Ngāti Awa with their ancestors and the atua of the natural world such as Ranginui, Papatuanuku, and Tāne. These traditions form the foundation of the identity of Ngāti Awa as an iwi. Some of these important historical traditions are recorded below.

According to Ngāti Awa, Te Hapūoneone, a division of Te Tini o Awa, were the original inhabitants of Ōhiwa Harbour. These people resided at Uretara and other pā at Tauwhare, Te Horo, and Paparoa. Ngāti Awa tipuna also whakapapa to various pre-migration iwi including Te Hapūoneone, Maruiwi, Ngā Pōtiki, Ngā Maihi, Te Mārangaranga, Te Tini o Toi, and Te Tini o Kawerau. From time to time, these groups traversed the lands around and within the Ōhiwa harbour, including Uretara Island.

The name Ōhiwa comes from Te Ōhiwa o Awanuiārangi II. Awanuiārangi II is the great grandson of Toroa, captain of the Mātaatua waka and is the principal ancestor of Ngāti Awa. Hapū of Ngāti Awa have resided at Uretara, within the Ōhiwa Harbour, since the time of Awanuiārangi II.

Uretara Island is one of a number of important Ngāti Awa pā sites and wāhi tapu in the Ōhiwa Harbour. Generations of Ngāti Awa have watched over Ōhiwa from Uretara Island. To the people of Ngāti Awa, Uretara Island is of great cultural and historical importance. Two major pā, Paripari and Karamea, were built on Uretara Island to access, protect, and watch over Ōhiwa. The strategic geographical position of the island made it an ideal fortified village. During the time of warfare the strategically built pā, terraces, surrounding water, and skilled Ngāti Awa warriors made it almost impossible for outsiders to conquer the island.

Many battles were fought between Ngāti Awa and other iwi over the control of Uretara Island. Ngāti Awa were often successful in those conflicts but sometimes suffered temporary defeats at the hands of other related Mātaatua tribes. During this time ownership of Uretara Island fluctuated between Ngāti Awa and Whakatōhea hapū, including Upokorehe. Prior to 1840 and the arrival of tauiwi (European settlers) Uretara Island was occupied by Te Kēpa Toihau and his people of the Whakatāne section of Ngāti Awa.

In 1862 a dispute over rights to Uretara Island arose between Ngāti Awa and Whakatōhea. Independent assessors were called in and they decided in favour of Ngāti Awa although Whakatōhea continued to express objections. Uretara Island was then included in the confiscation area in 1866 and was not returned to Māori by the Compensation Court. Since this time the island has been out of Ngāti Awa's control. However Ngāti Awa have always maintained a cultural and spiritual association to Uretara.

Uretara Island is one of the areas where the footprints of Ngāti Awa tipuna remain. It is a place where the people of Ngāti Awa would be able to sit and reflect on the life of their ancestors sensing the ihi (power), wehi (fear), and the mauri (life force) emanating from the land and water.

The Ngāti Awa tipuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai, other taonga, and ways in which to use the resources of Uretara Island. The tipuna were also knowleageable in the relationship of people with the area and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to the hapū of Ngāti Awa today.

Uretara Island is also the repository of kōiwi tangata. Urupā are the resting places of Ngāti Awa tipuna and, as such, are the focus of whānau traditions. Urupā and wāhi tapu are places holding the memories, traditions, victories, and defeats of Ngāti Awa tipuna.

To the people of Ngāti Awa, Uretara Island is of the utmost importance because of its physical, spiritual, and social significance in the past, present, and future. The mauri of Uretara Island represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāti Awa whānui to Uretara Island.

## Schedule 10  
Statutory acknowledgement for Whakatāne River

[s 40][60]

#### Statutory area

The area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies (statutory area) is the River known as the Whakatāne River, as shown on SO 61404, South Auckland Land District.

#### Preamble

Under [section 40][60], the Crown acknowledges Ngāti Awa's statement of Ngāti Awa's cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association to the Whakatāne River as set out below.

#### Cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association of Ngāti Awa with statutory area

It is the historical traditions of Ngāti Awa such as whakapapa, waiata, kōrero, and whakairo that illustrate the cultural and spiritual association of Ngāti Awa to the Whakatāne River. These histories link the present generations of Ngāti Awa with their ancestors and the atua of the natural world such as Ranginui, Papatuanuku, and Tāne. These traditions form the foundation of the identity of Ngāti Awa as an iwi. Some of these important historical traditions are recorded below.

The Whakatāne River is rich in historical and cultural association for Ngāti Awa. One of the founding ancestors of Ngāti Awa, Tīwakawaka, lived at the mouth of the Whakatāne River. Hoaki and Taukata landed here and were stranded at the river mouth. The Mātaatua waka also landed at the mouth of the Whakatāne River.

The present name ""Te Awa o Whakatāne"" relates to the arrival of the waka Mātaatua to Aotearoa. Wairaka was the daughter of Toroa and a member of the crew of the waka Mātaatua. When Mātaatua arrived at Whakatāne, most of the men of the waka climbed the hill at Kāpūterangi to observe the new land. They left the waka attended by a group of women. The mooring of the waka became loosened and it began to drift out to sea. Wairaka, who had been observing the situation, took the matter in hand and cried ""E! Kia Whakatāne ake au i ahau"" (Let me act the part of a man). Hence the name ""Whakatāne"". Toroa, the chief of Mātaatua, is acknowledged as one of the principal ancestors of Ngāti Awa.

The naming of various features including rocks in the Whakatāne River reflects the succession of explorers and ancestors of Ngāti Awa who lived along the Whakatāne River. Rocks in the mouth of the Whakatāne River include Te Puke-a-Hawaiki, Koakaroa, Areiawa, Toka Mauku, Toka Roa, Rangaia, and Roimata Turuturu. The Ngāti Awa people have used the Whakatāne River to access sacred sites along its banks. When the Mātaatua waka landed at Whakatāne, one of the very first tasks performed by Toroa and its other occupants was to build a sacred alter called a pouahu. The spot on which the pouahu was built was located on the bank of the Whakatāne River. The mauri of the Mātaatua waka was placed at the pouahu. This was an object that represented the physical and spiritual welfare of the waka and its occupants during its voyage. Later the mauri represented the welfare of the people in their residence. A mānuka tree was planted at the pouahu as a symbol representing life and well-being for the people of the Mātaatua waka. At this place people revealed their misfortunes, afflictions and transgressions. The symbolic nature of the mānuka tree gave expression to the term ""Te Mānuka Tūtahi"" (the lone standing mānuka tree). This term has become a strong spiritual identifying term for the people of Ngāti Awa.

Close to Te Mānuka Tūtahi on the side of the Whakatāne River was Hine Tuahoanga (ancestress of stone). This rock was once used by the hapū of Ngāti Awa for sharpening stone, aided with the waters from Whakatāne River alongside. On the other side of the river mouth from Te Mānuka Tūtahi lies the ancient urupā of Ōpihi-whanaunga-kore where many of the remains of the Ngāti Awa people who lived at Whakatāne are now buried and watch over Whakatāne River. Some notable Ngāti Awa ancestors buried at Ōpihi are Te Waiopōtanga, Toihau, Te Kēpa Toihau, Te Hāmaiwaho, Te Apanui, and Uaterangi.

There were a number of tipua (guardian spirits) and taniwha of special significance to Ngāti Awa that lived along the Whakatāne River. Tūtarakauika was one of the tipua that lived in the Whakatāne River. Tūtarakauika, because of his ability to communicate with life in the ocean, caused much jealousy among other young men of the tribe who later plotted and then clubbed him to death, and his body was taken out and cast into the sea. His father Takatūtahi and remaining sons Rongoiri and Tūtahi sought revenge, found the culprits, and took them to the same spot where they threw Tūtarakauika overboard. Takatūtahi, Rongoiri, and Tūtahi cast the offenders overboard and watched as they transformed into kutukutu moana (sea lice). Tūtarakauika, however, was revived, cared for, and became part of the family of Tangaroa, being adopted by Kiwa and Hinemōana.

Te Tahi o te Rangi is a famous taniwha of the Whakatāne River in the historical traditions of Ngāti Awa. In ancient times Te Tahi was a tohunga of great status in Ngāti Awa. It was believed that Te Tahi had great powers concerning the supernatural, and it was suspected by members of his tribe that these powers were being used for sinister purposes. These sinister suspicions were eventually brought to the fore when kūmara plants became blighted one season and it was Te Tahi who was blamed. A secret meeting was held in his absence and it was decided that he should be taken to Whakāri and left there to perish. A fishing expedition was organised and Te Tahi was led to believe that he would guide them due to his superior knowledge of the best fishing grounds. Once the expedition arrived at Whakaari, Te Tahi was tricked and the waka left without him, leaving him stranded on the island. Te Tahi summoned a whale which swam towards the rock where he sat. Te Tahi climbed onto the whale. The whale asked if the waka that had left Te Tahi should be destroyed and Te Tahi replied ""waiho ma te whakamā rātou e patu, waiho hei kōrero i a tātou kia atawhai ki te iwi"" (let their shame punish them, let us acquire fame by means of mercy). Te Tahi landed on a rock by the mouth of the Whakatāne River named Rukupō and could be seen by the returning canoes. Te Tahi then travelled to the rock Te Toka a Houmea, further inland along the Whakatāne River, where he rested. Later he was killed and his body then taken up the Rangitaiki River to Ōpuru (Te Ōpurunga o Te Tahi---The place where the body of Te Tahi was buried). His kaitiaki, the whale monster Tūtarakauika, swam up the Rangitaiki River and excavated a channel to Ōpuru, retrieved the body of Te Tahi and turned the body into a taniwha. There are several places along the Whakatāne River that are named after Te Tahi. Te Tahi is represented as a Marikihau in several carved houses of Ngāti Awa. The Whakatāne River and its banks have been occupied by the ancestors of Ngāti Awa since before the arrival of Mātaatua. More recently in the 18th and 19th centuries the chiefs Te Pūtarera, Tohi Te Ururangi, Toihau, Hokimōana, Te Ngārara, and their people resided at Te Whare o Toroa, the area around the present day Wairaka Marae which was located originally up against the banks of the river. Since this time there has been reclamation due to the change in the river's course. Cultivations and sites of houses were well established in this region. Throughout this period a number of hapū of Ngāti Awa resided along the Whakatāne River including Ngāti Maumoana, Ngai Te Hapū, Ngāti Ikapuku, Te Patuwai, Ngāti Pūkeko, Te Whānau a Taiwhakaea, Ngāti Hinanoa, Ngāti Kama, Ngai Tāpiki, and Ngāti Hokopū. The Whakatāne River was a life and spiritual source for those people. All of these hapū had various pā, kāinga, and wāhi tapu along the banks of the river.

There were also a number of wāhi tapu sites of significance to Ngāti Awa along the Whakatāne River. Mimihanui, Ōtangi-haku, Ōtarehie, Puke-rārauhe, Motueka, Rauporoa, Hūrepo, Ōtarehu, and Ōhineteraraku were kāinga (settlements) of Ngāti Awa along the river. Ōtarahioi and Te Mauku Pā are pā sites at Tāneatua. Pekapekatahi is a wāhi tapu near Tāneatua. This was the place where the Ngāti Awa tohunga Te Tahi o te Rangi crossed the Whakatāne River. Generations of Ngāti Awa have watched over the Whakatāne River from such places. The sites highlight Ngāti Awa's connections to Whakatāne River and the numerous residences along its shores. In particular, Pōhaturoa is a significant wāhi tapu site along the Whakatāne River. Pōhaturoa is important because it was where the Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti o Waitangi) was signed by Ngāti Awa. On 16 June 1840, representatives of the Ngāti Awa hapū of Ngāti Pūkeko and Ngai Tonu signed a copy of the Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti o Waitangi) at Pōhaturoa. This was an event of great historical significance for Whakatāne as well as for the people of Ngāti Pūkeko and Ngāti Awa. The chiefs that signed the Treaty were Tautari, Mōkai, Mato, Tarawatewate, Tūnui, Taupiri, Haukakawa, Pīariari, Matatehokia, Rewa, Tūpara and Mōkai II---presumed to be Mōkai's son.

Ngāti Awa have always maintained a considerable knowledge of the Whakatāne River, its history, the traditional trails of the tipuna along the river, the landing places of waka, the places for gathering kai and other taonga, and the ways in which to use the resources of the Whakatāne River. The Whakatāne River was valued by Ngāti Awa as a source of food including eels, kākahi, oysters, fish, and whitebait. The Whakatāne River was also used by Ngāti Awa to transport goods to and from the inland settlements of the iwi. Proper and sustainable resource management has always been at the heart of the relationship of Ngāti Awa with the Whakatāne River.

The traditional values of mana, mauri, whakapapa, and tapu are central to the relationship of Ngāti Awa with the Whakatāne River. The mana of the Whakatāne River is the power and importance of the river to Ngāti Awa. Mana also defines the custodian responsibility of Ngāti Awa as guardians of the river. The mauri of the Whakatāne River is the life force of the Whakatāne River. All forms of life have a mauri and all forms of life are related. One of the essential roles of Ngāti Awa is to protect the mauri of the river.

Whakapapa defines the genealogical relationship of Ngāti Awa to the Whakatāne River. Tapu describes the sacred nature of the relationship of Ngāti Awa to the Whakatāne River. Mana, mauri, whakapapa, and tapu are all important spiritual elements of the relationship of Ngāti Awa with the Whakatāne River. All of these values remain important to the people of Ngāti Awa today.

## Schedule 11  
Statutory acknowledgement for Rangitaiki River

[s 40][60]

#### Statutory area

The area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies (statutory area) is the river known as the Rangitaiki River, as shown on SO 61406, South Auckland Land District.

#### Preamble

Under [section 40][60], the Crown acknowledges Ngāti Awa's statement of Ngāti Awa's cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association to the Rangitaiki River as set out below.

#### Cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association of Ngāti Awa with statutory area

The traditions of Ngāti Awa illustrate the cultural, historical, and spiritual association of Ngāti Awa to the Rangitaiki River. For Ngāti Awa, traditions such as these represent the links between the world of the gods and present generations. These histories reinforce tribal identity, connection, and continuity between generations and confirm the importance of the Rangitaiki River to Ngāti Awa.

The Rangitaiki River has been a treasured taonga and resource for Ngāti Awa. Traditionally the Rangitaiki River and, in times past, the associated swamp area have been a source of food as well as a communication waterway. Te Mārangaranga were one group that held primacy over the swamp during the pre-migration period. They were principally located in the Rangitaiki valleys of Te Houhi and Te Whāiti. Upon the arrival of the waka Mātaatua this group inter-married with the new arrivals.

There were a number of taniwha and tipua (guardian spirits) that lived in and along the Rangitaiki River. One such taniwha was Hākai Atua. Hākai Atua was a taniwha of the Ngāti Awa hapū of Ngai Tamaoki and resided close to their kāinga. Hākai Atua travelled the river and was a kaitiaki who protected the Ngai Tamaoki people.

Raukawarua was a taniwha who lived at Kōkōhinau. Raukawarua was supposed to be a kaitiaki of other taniwha that lived in the river, thus Raukawarua became known as the rangatira of Ngāti Awa (the chief of the river tribe and of all other river creatures).

Rimurimu was a tipua of the Ngāti Awa hapū of Warahoe and Ngā Maihi who lived along the Rangitaiki River between Te Teko and Matahina. Rimurimu was only recognisable to the Warahoe hapū and only revealed itself to warn the people of danger. Rimurimu came about after Miro, daughter of Hikareia (a chief of Warahoe), drowned herself after her plan to be with her lover was thwarted. Miro chanted Te Punga i Orohia. A line in the chant refers to her being a rimu. Miro then took the form of Rimurimu.

Hine-i-Whāroa was a tipua in the form of a white eel that lived in the Rangitaiki River. Hine-i-Whāroa was the kaitiaki of all the other eels that lived in the river. Hine-i-Whāroa became the kaitiaki that limited the number of eels that could be caught by the people thereby ensuring that the fishery would survive. No matter how hard the people tried to catch Hine-i-Whāroa to clear the way so they would have unrestricted access to all eels, they could never do so.

In time the Warahoe hapū of Ngāti Awa, also descendants of Te Mārangaranga, occupied the lands along the Rangitaiki River. Warahoe was also the old name of the Ōrini Stream that connects the Rangitaiki and Whakatāne Rivers. The resources of the Rangitaiki River and swamp area were shared by the hapū of Ngāti Awa living in the area. The Ngāti Awa hapū of Ngāti Pūkeko, Ngāti Hokopū, and Te Patutātahi occupied the eastern bank of the Rangitaiki River. Te Pahipoto, Ngā Maihi, and Te Patutātahi occupied the upper (southern) portion of the river around Te Teko. Te Tāwera, Ngai Te Rangihouhiri II, and Ngāti Hikakino occupied the western edge of the river. Te Patutātahi had a large grouping of hapū that included Ngāti Hinanoa, Ngāti Kama, Ngāti Hina, Ngai Tāpiki, and Te Whānau a Taiwhakaea II. This group occupied the important central reaches of the Rangitaiki River. Te Patutātahi are today known as Ngai Taiwhakaea II. The Rangitaiki River was an essential resource and taonga for those hapū communities from the Ngātamawahine, Pōkairoa, Pāhekeheke, and Waikōwhewhe streams to the original outlet of the river at Mātata, where it once converged with the Tarawera River.

A number of settlements have been established by the hapū of Ngāti Awa along the Rangitaiki River. Such settlements highlight the connections of Ngāti Awa with the Rangitaiki River and their occupation of the river's catchments. One such settlement was Te Pūtere located on the coast between the Tarawera and Rangitaiki Rivers. Te Pūtere was a block of land slightly higher than the surrounding swamp area, originally inhabited by Ngāti Patuwai and later Te Patutātahi, Te Pahipoto, and Te Patuwai. Inland hapū used Te Pūtere as a fishing Nohoanga allowing them access to the resources of the lower reaches of the Rangitaiki River and the sea.

Further inland along the Rangitaiki River were the Ngāti Awa settlements of Te Kupenga and Te Teko (which remains one of the principal Ngāti Awa settlements along the river). Kōkōhinau Marae is another important Ngāti Awa settlement located in the Te Teko area along the bank of the Rangitaiki River. Te Pahipoto are the hapū of Kōkōhinau. Ngā Maihi, Ngāti Tamawera, and Ngai Tamaoki also had villages along the river. Ngāti Hāmua also have their kāinga and marae on the banks of the Rangitaiki River. Ōtipa Pā, occupied at different times by Ngā Maihi, Warahoe, and Ngāti Hāmua, is another Ngāti Awa kāinga located along the Rangitaiki River.

The Rangitaiki River provided the hapū of Ngāti Awa, particularly those living in pā along the river, with abundant food and material resources. Water from the river was used by Ngāti Awa to irrigate crops along the riverbanks. Flax and raupo grew well along the river and, in times past, in the swamp ground. These provided materials for clothing, building, and trade for the Ngāti Awa hapū. Fish, eels, and birds were also in plentiful supply. Not only did the Rangitaiki River provide the Ngāti Awa hapū with food, trade, and building materials but it also allowed easy internal movement for the hapū of Ngāti Awa from one end of the rohe to the other and provided refuge in times of danger.

The tipuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the Rangitaiki River, the relationship of people with the river and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of resources. All of these values remain important to the people of Ngāti Awa today.

All elements of the natural environment possess a life force and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāti Awa whānui to the Rangitaiki River.

The Rangitaiki River has always been an integral part of the social, spiritual, and physical lifestyle of the Ngāti Awa people.

## Schedule 12  
Statutory acknowledgement for Tarawera River

[s 40][60]

#### Statutory area

The area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies (statutory area) is the river known as the Tarawera River, as shown on SO 61403, South Auckland Land District.

#### Preamble

Under [section 40][60], the Crown acknowledges Ngāti Awa's statement of Ngāti Awa's cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association to the Tarawera River as set out below.

#### Cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association of Ngāti Awa with statutory area

The traditions of Ngāti Awa illustrate the cultural, historical, and spiritual association of Ngāti Awa to the Tarawera River. For Ngāti Awa, traditions such as these represent the links between the world of the gods and present generations. These histories reinforce tribal identity, connection, and continuity between generations and confirm the importance of the Tarawera River to Ngāti Awa.

The Tarawera River was created by the tears of Tarawera. Tarawera yearned for her husband, Pūtauaki, who left her for the island of Moutohorā. In ancient times before the arrival of the waka Mātaatua the banks of the Tarawera River were inhabited by ancestors of Ngāti Awa including Te Tini o Toi, Te Tini o Awa, and Te Tini o Kawerau. In more modern times, but long before the arrival of Europeans, hapū such as Ngai Te Rangihouhiri II, Ngāti Hikakino, and Te Tāwera utilised the resources of the river and occupied its banks.

A number of tipua (guardian spirits) and taniwha of special significance to Ngāti Awa inhabited the Tarawera River. Taratua was one such taniwha. This feared taniwha of Ngāti Awa lived at Ruataniwha. In ancient times Taratua terrorised and devoured people attempting to travel along the river. Taratua was later killed by an ancestor of Ngāti Awa named Iratūmoana. The story of Taratua is well known and features the Ngāti Awa tipuna Iratūmoana, who was successful in killing the feared taniwha.

Te Awa a Te Atua is the name of the mouth of the Tarawera River. When the Mātaatua waka arrived at Te Awa a Te Atua, Wairaka bathed at the river mouth. While Wairaka was swimming she was overcome with her menstruation. Her father, Toroa, chief of the Mātaatua waka saw blood floating down the river and asked whose godly blood it was. Wairaka confirmed that it was her blood and Toroa named the river mouth Te Awa a Te Atua (the river of the Gods).

The people of Ngāti Awa lived in many villages located along the banks of the Tarawera River. The riverbanks thus became the repository of many kōiwi tangata. Urupā are the resting places of Ngāti Awa tipuna and, as such, are the focus of whānau traditions. Urupā and wāhi tapu are places holding the memories, traditions, victories, and defeats of Ngāti Awa tipuna, and are frequently protected in secret locations. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāti Awa whānui to the Tarawera River.

Awaiti is a well-known Ngāti Awa wāhi tapu along the Tarawera River. Awaiti was named by the Ngāti Awa chief Tīhori when he released the two taniwha Tūtarakauika and Tūpai into the Tarawera River. These two taniwha formed the Kōmutumutu River, which connects the Rangitaiki and Tarawera Rivers. The Kōmutumutu River flows into the Tarawera River (the smaller river), hence the name, Te Awaiti o Tīhori. Another site near the Tarawera River named by Tīhori was Kōpai o Piko. Kōpai o Piko was named when Tīhori found out that his wife had been unfaithful to him and he decided to leave Matahina. Tīhori built a waka, Whakapaukarakia, and he left the district via the Rangitaiki River and then through Kōmutumutu into the Tarawera River and finally out at Te Awa a Te Atua. The two taniwha, Tūtarakauika and Tūpai, dug out a channel which enabled Tīhori to travel to Te Awa a Te Atua. The channel they created formed bends in the land that established the Kōmutumutu River, hence the name Kōpai o Piko.

Te Tatau o Hape is another wāhi tapu of Ngāti Awa at the Tarawera Falls. Hape was a great ancestor of Ngāti Awa who went in search of greenstone. Hape travelled along the Tarawera River during his journey. When Hape arrived at the Tarawera Falls, he placed a huge boulder in the path of the Tarawera River, hence the Māori name of the Tarawera Falls, Te Tatau a Hape (the door of Hape).

The Tarawera River was a major food and water resource to the Ngāti Awa people both prior to and since the arrival of the Mātaatua waka. Ngāti Awa people resided in a number of pā sites located along the riverbank. Such sites are significant to Ngāti Awa and illustrate Ngāti Awa connections to the Tarawera River. A sacred pā site along the Tarawera River is Parawai. Parawai was one of the pā of Te Tāwera hapū of Ngāti Awa. Parawai was the site of many battles between Ngāti Awa and other iwi. Another important pā of Ngāti Awa was Te Kohika. This was located toward the coast and near the island pā of Te Matata and Ōmarupōtiki and was used to access the reefs at the mouth of the river. Ōmataroro was another important Ngāti Awa pā near the Tarawera River. Ngāti Awa watched over and protected the Tarawera River from such pā.

From time to time other hapū such as Ngāti Pūkeko and Ngāti Hāmua also lived along the Tarawera River near its mouth.

The Tarawera River provided an abundance of fish, eels, kākahi, and whitebait for the hapū of Ngāti Awa. The junction of the Waikāmihi Stream and the Tarawera River was an important fishing location for whitebait, eels, and other fish for Te Tāwera hapū of Ngāti Awa. As well as being an abundant source of food for the hapū of Ngāti Awa, the Tarawera River was also used as a highway to assist the transportation of materials and people up and down the river. Waka that travelled up and down the Tarawera River were launched at Ōkauneke.

The tipuna had considerable knowledge of whakapapa, traditional trails and tauranga waka, places for gathering kai and other taonga, ways in which to use the resources of the Tarawera River, the relationship of people with the river and their dependence on it, and tikanga for the proper and sustainable utilisation of its resources. All of these values remain important to the hapū of Ngāti Awa today.

## Schedule 13  
Statutory acknowledgement for Te Kaokaoroa Historic Reserve

[s 40][60]

#### Statutory area

The area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies (statutory area) is the area known as Te Kaokaoroa Historic Reserve, as shown on SO 61402, South Auckland Land District.

#### Preamble

Under [section 40][60], the Crown acknowledges Ngāti Awa's statement of Ngāti Awa's cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association to Te Kaokaoroa Historic Reserve as set out below.

#### Cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association of Ngāti Awa with statutory area

It is the historical traditions of Ngāti Awa that illustrate the cultural and spiritual association of Ngāti Awa to Te Kaokaoroa. For Ngāti Awa, traditions such as these represent the links between the world of the gods and present generations. These histories reinforce tribal identity, solidarity, and continuity between generations and document the events which shaped the environment of Te Kaokaoroa and Ngāti Awa as an iwi.

A significant event in the history of Ngāti Awa was the arrival of the waka Mātaatua to Aotearoa. Toroa, the chief of Mātaatua, is acknowledged as one of the principal ancestors of Ngāti Awa. When the Mātaatua canoe made landfall at Te Awa o Te Atua (Matata), Toroa, observing that the shore line from the river mouth right across to Ōtamarakau was like a rib bone, named it Te Kaokaoroa o Toroa (the long rib of Toroa). Over time a number of pā sites and wāhi tapu of Ngāti Awa hapū, including Ngai Te Rangihouhiri II, Ngāti Hikakino, and Te Tāwera, developed along Te Kaokaoroa o Toroa. The pā sites included Mōkaingārara and Te Matata (near Matata) and Nohonoho, Hauone, and Te Paripari (towards Ōtamarakau). The wāhi tapu included Arakino and Te Awatarariki. Te Kaokaoroa Reserve is part of this landscape named by Toroa.

Te Kaokaoroa Reserve is sacred to several hapū of Ngāti Awa including Ngai Te Rangihouhiri II, Ngāti Hikakino, and Te Tāwera, because it commemorates a great battle between Government forces and the Tai Rawhiti force along Te Kaokaoroa o Toroa coastline in 1864\.

The Tai Rawhiti force was a collection of armies of the East Coast tribes who intended to travel to Waikato to support the Kingitanga to defend the invasion of their lands by Government forces and European settlers. The Tai Rawhiti force included Ngāti Awa, Whakatōhea, Tūhoe, Te Whānau-a-Apanui, and Ngāti Porou.

The Tai Rawhiti forces established a camp on the eastern side of the Waihi lagoon at Maketu. The joint Crown and Te Arawa force set up camp on the western side. The stalemate was broken with the arrival of two Government warships, the _HMS Falcon_ and _HMS Sandfly_. The ships began shelling the Tai Rawhiti forces who were then forced to retreat towards Ōtamarakau. The battle of Te Kaokaoroa ensued. Many of the Tai Rawhiti force lost their lives. The dead included those of Whakatōhea, Te Whānau-a-Apanui, Ngāti Porou, and Ngāti Awa.

Te Kaokaoroa Reserve is the resting place of Te Rangi-i-paea, a chief of Ngāti Hikakino, who was killed at the battle of Te Kaokaoroa. Many unnamed dead of Ngai Te Rangihouhiri II, Ngāti Hikakino, Te Tāwera, and other hapū of Ngāti Awa were buried at this site by Hori Kawakawa and other Ngāti Awa chiefs. Hoera-tama-titahi, chief of the Ngāti Porou contingent that was part of the Tai Rawhiti Force, also lies buried at Te Kaokaoroa.

Te Kaokaoroa is therefore the repository of many kōiwi tangata. Urupā are the resting places of Ngāti Awa tipuna and, as such, are the focus of whānau traditions. Urupā and wāhi tapu are places holding the memories, traditions, victories, and defeats of Ngāti Awa tipuna, and are frequently protected in secret locations.

The mauri of Te Kaokaoroa Reserve represents the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding life. All elements of the natural environment possess a life force and all forms of life are related. Mauri is a critical element of the spiritual relationship of Ngāti Awa whānui to Te Kaokaoroa.

#### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

Under [section 41][61], and without limiting the rest of this schedule, the purposes of this statutory acknowledgement are---
    
*   (a) to require that relevant consent authorities, the New Zealand Historic Places Trust, or the Environment Court, as the case may be, have regard to this statutory acknowledgement in relation to Te Kaokaoroa Historic Reserve, as provided in [sections 42 to 44][62]; and

*   (b) to require that relevant consent authorities forward summaries of resource consent applications to the Ngāti Awa governance entity as provided in [section 46][66]; and

*   (c) to enable the Ngāti Awa governance entity and any member of Ngāti Awa to cite this statutory acknowledgement as evidence of the association of Ngāti Awa to Te Kaokaoroa Historic Reserve as provided in [section 47][67].

#### Limitations on effect of statutory acknowledgement

Except as expressly provided in [sections 41 to 44][61] and [47][67]---
    
*   (a) this statutory acknowledgement does not affect, and is not to be taken into account in, the exercise of any power, duty, or function by any person or entity under any statute, regulation, or bylaw; and

*   (b) no person or entity, in considering any matter or making any decision or recommendation under any statute, regulation, or bylaw, may give any greater or lesser weight to Ngāti Awa's association with Te Kaokaoroa Historic Reserve than that person or entity would give under the relevant statute, regulation, or bylaw if this statutory acknowledgement had not been made.

Except as expressly provided in [subpart 3][58] of Part 4, this statutory acknowledgement does not affect the lawful rights or interests of any person who is not a party to the deed of settlement.

Except as expressly provided in [subpart 3][58] of Part 4, this statutory acknowledgement does not have the effect of granting, creating, or providing evidence of any estate or interest in, or any rights of any kind whatsoever relating to, Te Kaokaoroa Historic Reserve.

#### No limitation on the Crown

The existence of this statutory acknowledgement does not prevent the Crown from providing a statutory acknowledgement in respect of Te Kaokaoroa Historic Reserve to a person or persons other than Ngāti Awa or a representative entity.

## Schedule 14  
Statutory acknowledgement for Former Matahina A5 Block

[s 40][60]

#### Statutory area

The area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies (statutory area) is the area known as Former Matahina A5 Block, as shown on SO 61685, South Auckland Land District.

#### Preamble

Under [section 40][60], the Crown acknowledges Ngāti Awa's statement of Ngāti Awa's cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association to Former Matahina A5 Block as set out below.

#### Cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association of Ngāti Awa with statutory area

It is the historical traditions of Ngāti Awa such as whakapapa, waiata, kōrero, and whakairo that illustrate the cultural and spiritual association of Ngāti Awa to Matahina A5\. These histories link the present generations of Ngāti Awa with their ancestors and the atua of the natural world such as Ranginui, Papatuanuku, and Tāne. These traditions form the foundation of the identity of Ngāti Awa as an iwi. Some of these important historical traditions are recorded below.

Ngāti Awa tipuna whakapapa to various pre-migration iwi including Te Hapūoneone, Maruiwi, Ngā Pōtiki, Ngā Maihi, Te Mārangaranga, Te Tini o Toi, and Te Tini o Kawerau. From time to time, these groups also traversed the lands, rivers, mountains, and forests of the Eastern Bay of Plenty region including the Matahina Valley. Prior to the arrival of tauiwi (European settlers), the tipuna of Ngāti Awa established important communities all along the banks of the principal rivers of the region, including the Rangitaiki. The ancestors of Ngā Maihi, Warahoe, Ngāti Hāmua, Ngai Tamaoki, Ngai Taipoti, Ngāti Ahi, Ngai Taiwhakaea, Te Tāwera, and Ngāti Pūkeko had settlements over the Matahina blocks and along the Rangitaiki River including the pā at Ōtipa.

The rich soils and waterways of the Rangitaiki and the Matahina Valley provided Ngāti Awa hapū with an abundance of food (birds, animals, fish), building materials, material for clothing, and cultivation sites. As communities became established around pā and kāinga, like those of Ngāti Awa along the banks of the Rangitaiki River, so too did the need for urupā (burying places). Urupā are the resting places of Ngāti Awa tipuna and, as such, are the focus of whānau traditions. Urupā and wāhi tapu are places holding the memories, traditions, victories, and defeats of Ngāti Awa tipuna.

Many battles were fought between Ngāti Awa and other iwi in the Matahina region and even further inland over several centuries, despite their close whakapapa and kin relationships. Ngāti Awa were often successful in those conflicts but sometimes suffered temporary defeats at the hands of other iwi and hapū. Hostilities between Ngāti Awa and other iwi continued for several decades following the arrival of the first settlers and missionaries to the area. Matahina A5 is an urupā site in the far north of the former Matahina block. Once near the Rangitaiki River since the late 1960s it has been partially submerged within Lake Matahina.

As a consequence of settlement patterns, warfare, and migrations, many Ngāti Awa hapū have dead buried in what became Matahina A5 including Ngā Maihi, Warahoe, Ngāti Hāmua, Ngai Tamaoki, Ngai Taipoti, Ngāti Ahi, Ngai Taiwhakaea, Te Tāwera, and Ngāti Pūkeko. Ngāti Awa have maintained strong connections in their custodianship role over this urupā across many generations. Matahina A5 is therefore an ancient and important urupā for the hapū of Ngāti Awa.

According to Ngāti Awa traditions, after the arrival of Europeans Te Rangitūkehu restored Warahoe and Ngāti Hāmua to the Matahina area as an act of aroha for those hapū, including those who were and remain part of Ngāti Awa. They had previously been driven away by Te Rangitūkehu and his tipuna in the inter-iwi and hapū conflicts of an earlier era. It was on account of the gift from Te Rangitūkehu that Ngāti Awa say other iwi and hapū were permitted to re-settle in the Matahina region.

In 1881 and 1884, the Native Land Court recognised the customary interests of Ngāti Awa in Matahina A5 and a nearby urupā, Matahina A4, by vesting those wāhi tapu in Te Rangitūkehu Hātua and Te Whāiti Paora as trustees. Te Rangitūkehu, as one of the leading rangatira of Ngāti Awa at that time, undertook the principal kaitiaki role over Matahina A5 on behalf of the iwi in accordance with Ngāti Awa custom. During the 20th century Ngāti Awa continued to maintain their custodianship over Matahina A5 without interference from other iwi and hapū.

In the 1960s, using public works legislation, the Crown took land from Ngāti Awa including Matahina A5 to create the Matahina Lake and power project and Te Māhoe village. During the construction of Matahina Dam, the Crown advised that it intended to destroy parts of Matahina A5\. The elders of Ngāti Awa at the time, while expressing dismay at these proposals, acted to ensure the kōiwi tangata were protected and removed them from those burial sites including Matahina A5 that were threatened by the power project. Even though the title of Matahina A5 was taken from Ngāti Awa, the site remains a sacred urupā and wāhi tapu for the iwi.

#### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

Under [section 41][61], and without limiting the rest of this schedule, the purposes of this statutory acknowledgement are---
    
*   (a) to require that relevant consent authorities, the New Zealand Historic Places Trust, or the Environment Court, as the case may be, have regard to this statutory acknowledgement in relation to Former Matahina A5 Block, as provided in [sections 42 to 44][62]; and

*   (b) to require that relevant consent authorities forward summaries of resource consent applications to the Ngāti Awa governance entity as provided in [section 46][66]; and

*   (c) to enable the Ngāti Awa governance entity and any member of Ngāti Awa to cite this statutory acknowledgement as evidence of the association of Ngāti Awa to Former Matahina A5 Block as provided in [section 47][67].

#### Limitations on effect of statutory acknowledgement

Except as expressly provided in [sections 41 to 44][61] and [47][67]---
    
*   (a) this statutory acknowledgement does not affect, and is not to be taken into account in, the exercise of any power, duty, or function by any person or entity under any statute, regulation, or bylaw; and

*   (b) no person or entity, in considering any matter or making any decision or recommendation under any statute, regulation, or bylaw, may give any greater or lesser weight to Ngāti Awa's association with Former Matahina A5 Block than that person or entity would give under the relevant statute, regulation, or bylaw if this statutory acknowledgement had not been made.

Except as expressly provided in [subpart 3][58] of Part 4, this statutory acknowledgement does not affect the lawful rights or interests of any person who is not a party to the deed of settlement.

Except as expressly provided in [subpart 3][58] of Part 4, this statutory acknowledgement does not have the effect of granting, creating, or providing evidence of any estate or interest in, or any rights of any kind whatsoever relating to, Former Matahina A5 Block.

#### No limitation on the Crown

The existence of this statutory acknowledgement does not prevent the Crown from providing a statutory acknowledgement in respect of Former Matahina A5 Block to a person or persons other than Ngāti Awa or a representative entity.
