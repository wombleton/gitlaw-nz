NZTA 43 

The Detailed Mitigation Options shall be implemented prior to completion of construction of the Project, with the exception of any low-noise road surfaces, which shall be implemented within 12 months of completion of construction.

NZTA 44

    *   (iv) the owner of the Category C Building cannot, after reasonable enquiry, be found prior to completion of construction of the Project; or
    
    

*   (d) if any of (c)(ii) to (iv) above apply to a particular Category C Building, the Agency shall not be required to implement any Building-Modification Mitigation at that Category C Building.
