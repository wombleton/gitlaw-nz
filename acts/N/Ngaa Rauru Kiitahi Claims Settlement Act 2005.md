    (2) Recitals (3) to (21) of this Preamble present, in summary form, the background to the Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi historical claims that is set out in the deed of settlement entered into by Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi and the Crown:
    
    ###### Rohe of Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi
    
    (3) According to the oral traditions of Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi the rohe of Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi at 1840 began at Kaihau-a-Kupe (the mouth of the Whanganui River). The kainga or occupied sites at Kaihau-a-Kupe included Kaihokahoka (ki tai), Kokohuia (the swampy area at Castlecliff), Te Whare Kakaho (the Wordsworth Street area), Pungarehu/Te Ahi Tuatini (Cobham Bridge), Te Oneheke (between Karamu Stream and Churton Creek), Patupuhou, Nukuiro, and Kaieerau (St Johns Hill):
    
    (4) The rohe then extended from Kaieerau along the watershed to Motuhou, Kaihoahoka (ki uta), Taurangapiopio, Taumatarata, Mataimoana, Taurangakawa and north into the Matemateaonga Ranges and the area known as Tawhiwhi:
    
    (5) After the Matemateaonga Ranges is the Mangaehu Stream where the Mangaehu Pa was situated, near the source of Te Awa-nui-a-Taikehu (Patea River). Between Te Awanui-a-Taikehu and Whenuakura Rivers (Te Arei o Rauru) were the pa of Maipu and Hawaiki:
    
    (6) Many Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi pa and kainga were also situated along Te Awanui-a-Taikehu, such as Oowhio, Kaiwaka, Arakirikiri, Ngaa-papa-tara-iwi, Tutumaahoe, and Parikaarangaranga. At the mouth of the river sat the kainga and marae of Rangitaawhi and Wai-o-Turi which remain today. Along the shoreline between Rangitaawhi and Tuaropaki lies Te Kiri o Rauru:
    
    (7) Between Rangitaawhi and the mouth of the Whenuakura River stood Tihoi Pa (where Te Rauparaha rested). From Tihoi the rohe extends to Waipipi, Tapuarau, Waitotara River, Waiinu, Waikaramihi, and Te Wai-o-Mahuki (near Te Ihonga). It continues past the Ototoka Stream to Poopoia (the marae of Aokehu at the mouth of the Okehu Stream), and then continues onwards to the mouth of the Kai Iwi Stream near the marae of Taipake Tuturu. From here the rohe stretches past Tutaramoana (the kaitiaki moana) back to Kaihau-a-Kupe:
    
    (8) The area of the Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi rohe in 1840, as described above, was approximately 210 000 hectares (520 000 acres), according to a digital map calculation in 2003:
    
    ###### Relationship of Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi with Whanganui River
    
    (9) Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi has whakapapa interests in the Whanganui River. Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi recognises that Whanganui iwi has mana and rangatiratanga on the Whanganui River:
    
    ###### Background to the deed of settlement  
    Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi makes submissions to the Waitangi Tribunal
    
    (10) Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi has longstanding claims against the Crown. Claims against the Crown have been expressed through petitions and protests made by Taranaki Maori, including Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi. Those petitions and protests contributed to the establishment, in the 19th and 20th centuries, of various commissions of inquiry into lands confiscated from Taranaki Maori (including Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi):
    
    (11) [Section 6][165] of the Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975 enabled Maori (including Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi) to submit claims to the Waitangi Tribunal in respect of acts or omissions on or after 6 February 1840 by or on behalf of the Crown that were inconsistent with the principles of the [Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti o Waitangi)][164]:
    
    (12) The Waitangi Tribunal between 1990 and 1995 investigated 21 claims concerning Taranaki made to the Waitangi Tribunal under [section 6][165] of the Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975 (the _Taranaki Claims_). The Taranaki Claims included claims of Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi. A considerable number of submissions and research reports were filed by Taranaki Maori (including Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi) with the Waitangi Tribunal in relation to the claims of Taranaki Maori (including Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi):
    
    ###### The Crown's acknowledgements to Waitangi Tribunal
    
    (13) The Crown advised the Waitangi Tribunal, after hearing the claimants' evidence, that it considered there was a basis for negotiation with claimants and that the Crown had invited claimants to meet with it for that purpose. The Crown asked the Waitangi Tribunal to issue an interim report in order to assist the negotiation process between the Crown and claimants (including Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi):
    
    (14) The Waitangi Tribunal asked the Crown to indicate those matters upon which it would not wish to give evidence before the Tribunal. The Crown provided this advice to the Waitangi Tribunal on 28 December 1995 in its Interim Response (which is Document 2.108 on the Waitangi Tribunal's Record of Inquiry for Taranaki):
    
    (15) The Crown acknowledged to the Waitangi Tribunal in its Interim Response that---
        
    *   (a) the Waitara purchase and the wars that followed constituted an injustice and were, therefore, in breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti o Waitangi)][164] and its principles; and
    
    *   (b) the confiscation of land, as it occurred in Taranaki, also constituted an injustice and was, therefore, in breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti o Waitangi)][164] and its principles; and
    
    *   (c) the confiscation had a severe impact upon the welfare, economy, and development of the iwi of Taranaki; and
    
    *   (d) in general terms, the delays in setting aside reserves contributed to the adverse effects of the confiscation; and
    
    *   (e) events relating to the implementation of the confiscation leading to the invasion of Parihaka in 1881, the invasion itself, and its aftermath constituted a breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti o Waitangi)][164] and its principles:
    
    ###### Interim Taranaki Report of Waitangi Tribunal
    
    (16) The Waitangi Tribunal issued in June 1996 an interim report called The Taranaki Report: Kaupapa Tuatahi (the _Interim Taranaki Report_) giving its preliminary views on the Taranaki Claims:
    
    (17) The Waitangi Tribunal issued the Interim Taranaki Report---
        
    *   (a) based on the Waitangi Tribunal's inquiry up to the date of the report (and noted that the Crown had yet to be heard on many matters raised); and
    
    *   (b) in order to expedite negotiations for a settlement of the Taranaki Claims (including the claims of Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi):
    
    ###### Views of the Waitangi Tribunal in the Interim Tribunal Report
    
    (18) The Waitangi Tribunal, in the Interim Report, expressed some preliminary views concerning the Taranaki Claims including that---
        
    *   (a) the claims could be the largest in the country. There may be no others where as many Treaty breaches had equivalent force and effect over a comparable time (section 1.1); and
    
    *   (b) the claims stood on two major foundations, land deprivation and disempowerment, with the latter being the main foundation. By ""disempowerment"", the Waitangi Tribunal meant the denigration and destruction of Maori autonomy or self-government (section 1.4); and
    
    *   (c) the Tribunal's Interim Report has introduced the historical claims of the Taranaki hapuu. It has shown the need for a settlement (section 12.3.1); and
    
    *   (d) generous reparation policies were needed to remove the prejudice to Maori, to restore the honour of the Government, to ensure cultural survival, and to re-establish effective interaction between the Treaty partners (section 12.2):
    
    ###### The settlement negotiations with Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi
    
    (19) The Nga Rauru Iwi Authority received in 1999 a mandate from Ngaa Uki o Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi to negotiate a deed of settlement with the Crown. The Crown recognised the mandate of the Nga Rauru Iwi Authority in April 2000:
    
    (20) The Nga Rauru Iwi Authority and the Crown entered into---
        
    *   (a) a terms of negotiation dated 11 October 2000, which specified the scope, objectives, and general procedures for the negotiations; and
    
    *   (b) an agreement in principle dated 16 May 2002 recording that the Nga Rauru Iwi Authority and the Crown were, in principle, willing to enter into a deed of settlement on the basis set out in the agreement in principle:
    
    (21) Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi ratified the Crown's final settlement offer and entered into a deed of settlement on 27 November 2003\. The deed records the agreement between Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi and the Crown to settle the historical claims of Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi.

##### 8 Text of acknowledgements in English
    
*   The text of the acknowledgements in English as set out in the deed of settlement is as follows:
    
    (1) The Crown acknowledges that the cumulative effect of its breaches of the [Treaty of Waitangi][164] and its principles outlined below has contributed to the dismantling of Ngaa Raurutanga, and the loss of Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi land, language, and social structures. This has affected the economic capacity and physical, cultural, and spiritual well-being of Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. The Crown acknowledges that it has failed to adequately recognise and respect Ngaa Raurutanga in breach of its obligations guaranteeing Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi the exercise of rangatiratanga under Article Two of the Treaty of Waitangi.
    
    (2) The Crown acknowledges that:
        
    *   (a) Crown purchasing, such as the Waitotara purchase that commenced in 1859, created tensions that contributed to the continuation of the Taranaki wars in which Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi participated; and
    
    *   (b) the continuation of the Waitotara purchase during a time of war was not appropriate and exacerbated divisions within Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi; and
    
    *   (c) because of the circumstances prevailing in Taranaki between 1859 and 1863, elements of the Waitotara purchase constituted a breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi][164] and its principles.
    
    (3) The Crown acknowledges that:
        
    *   (a) it proclaimed martial law in Taranaki in 1860 and that later in 1864--1865 it launched an offensive in south Taranaki; and
    
    *   (b) Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi suffered loss of life during the wars, including the lives of unarmed children killed by government militia at Handley's Woolshed in an unprovoked attack; and
    
    *   (c) Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi suffered the destruction of their homes, property, cultivations, and taonga at the Crown's hands during the wars and as a result of the Crown's ""scorched earth"" policy in south Taranaki; and
    
    *   (d) during the wars those Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi who were driven off their land had to rely on the goodwill of other iwi for refuge; and
    
    *   (e) Ngaa Uki o Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi were forced into exile from their rohe and rendered homeless from 1869 until 1873, and remained without permanent homes until they received the reserves to which they were entitled after the West Coast Commissions of Inquiry in 1880 and 1881; and
    
    *   (f) its treatment of Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi taken prisoner during the wars of the 1860s, such as those who were at Weraroa in 1865, resulted in hardships for those imprisoned and their whaanau and hapuu and that these hardships were suffered again in 1879--1880; and
    
    *   (g) the wars constituted an injustice and were in breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi][164] and its principles.
    
    (4) The Crown acknowledges that:
        
    *   (a) it acted unfairly in labelling some Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi as rebels, which had detrimental consequences for the whole iwi whose land was confiscated as a result; and
    
    *   (b) the confiscation was indiscriminate in extent and application; and
    
    *   (c) as a result of the confiscation in 1865, Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi was dispossessed of land and resources and unable to exercise Ngaa Raurutanga over them, which had a devastating effect on the economic development and the social and cultural well-being of Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi; and
    
    *   (d) the prejudicial effect of the confiscation was compounded by the inadequacies in the Compensation Court process, by which reserves were to be granted to Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi; and
    
    *   (e) delays in the implementation of the Compensation Court awards and systematic Crown acquisition of Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi interests meant that ultimately Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi received only 3 000 of the 17 000 acres granted to south Taranaki Maori by the Compensation Court; and
    
    *   (f) when land was finally returned, Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi found that its customary title to this land had been compulsorily extinguished by the Crown's confiscation, and this was a breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi][164] and its principles; and
    
    *   (g) the confiscation was unjust, compulsorily extinguished Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi customary title to land, and was a breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi][164] and its principles.
    
    (5) The Crown acknowledges that the treatment of those Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi and Taranaki Maori imprisoned and exiled as a result of the passive resistance campaign from 1879 to 1880 deprived those people of basic human rights, inflicted unwarranted hardships on them and their whaanau and hapuu, and this was a breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi][164] and its principles.
    
    (6) The Crown acknowledges that:
        
    *   (a) the West Coast Commissions were inadequate in their scope and did not address the injustices perpetrated by the confiscations; and
    
    *   (b) the reserves formalised by the Commissions were not sufficient for the ongoing needs of Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi within the confiscation boundary; and
    
    *   (c) its actions with respect to the West Coast Settlement Reserves, including the imposition of a regime of perpetually renewable leases and the sale of land by the Public and Maori Trustees in the 20th century---
            
        *   (i) have ultimately deprived Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi hapuu of the control and ownership of the minimal land set aside for them; and
        
        *   (ii) considered cumulatively, were in breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi][164] and its principles.
        
        
    
    (7) The Crown acknowledges that:
        
    *   (a) some Crown policies relating to Maori land have had a prejudicial effect on those Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi who wished to retain their land and diminished their ability to exercise Ngaa Raurutanga over that land; and
    
    *   (b) the town of Waverley, the Nukumaru Domain, the vast scenic reserves, and other tracts of land now making up the conservation estate, were once under the protection of Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi as kaitiaki; and
    
    *   (c) the people of Taranaki and New Zealand generally have benefited from the land and other resources confiscated and otherwise alienated from Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi, while the cumulative effect of the Crown's actions has been to leave Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi virtually landless; and
    
    *   (d) the Crown has failed to ensure that sufficient land was retained by Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi for their present and future needs and this failure was a breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi][164] and its principles.
    
    (8) The Crown acknowledges that Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi has pursued grievances that relate to Crown action in the 19th and 20th centuries in addition to those grievances the Crown acknowledges are in breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi][164] and its principles. Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi has sought redress for its grievances for the last 150 years and, despite efforts made in the 20th century, the Crown has failed to deal with the grievances of Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi and its breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles in an appropriate way. The recognition of these grievances and breaches is long overdue. The sense of grief and loss suffered by Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi remains today.

## Schedule 4  
Statutory acknowledgement for Nukumaru Recreation Reserve

[s 40][60]

#### Statutory area

The area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the area known as Nukumaru Recreation Reserve, the general location of which is indicated on SO 314760\.

#### Preamble

Under [section 40][60], the Crown acknowledges the statement by Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi of the cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association of Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi with the Nukumaru Recreation Reserve as set out below.

#### Cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association of Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi with statutory area

Waikaramihi is the name given to the marae tawhito that is situated within the Nukumaru Recreation Reserve, on the coast between Waiinu and Tuaropaki. Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi traditionally camped at Waikaramihi from October to March each year. The main food gathering area was between the Waitotara river mouth and Tuaropaki. The sources of food include kakahi (fresh water mussels), sea mussels, kina, paua, papaka (crabs), karingo (seaweed), and very small octopus stranded in the small rock pools from the receding tides. While Ngaati Maika and Ngaati Ruaiti were the main hapuu that used Waikaramihi, all Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi hapuu traditionally gathered kai moana in accordance with the values of Ngaa Raurutanga.

The Karewaonui canoe (over 100 years old) was until 1987 housed at Waikaramihi and was used by Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi (mainly Ngaati Maika and Ngaati Ruaiti) to catch stingray, shark, snapper, and hapuka about 10 miles off the coast. Karakia were used when Karewaonui was ""put to sea"", and an offering of the first fish caught on Karewaonui was always given to the Kaitiaki-o-te-moana.

The area is still significant to Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi as a mahinga kai source from which the physical well-being of Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi is sustained, and the spiritual well-being nourished.

## Schedule 5  
Statutory acknowledgement for Coastal Marine Area adjoining Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi area of interest

[s 40][60]

#### Statutory area

The area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the area known as the Coastal Marine Area adjoining the Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi area of interest, the general location of which is indicated on SO 314770\.

#### Preamble

Under [section 40][60], the Crown acknowledges the statement by Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi of the cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association of Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi with the Coastal Marine Area adjoining the Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi area of interest as set out below.

#### Cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association of Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi with statutory area

Within this coastal area between Rangitaawhi and Wai-o-Turi Marae is ""Te Kiri o Rauru"", the skin of Rauru. Te Kiri o Rauru is an important life force that has contributed to the physical and spiritual well-being of Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi.

Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi used the entire coastal area from Te Awanui o Taikehu (Patea River) to the mouth of the Whanganui River and inland for food gathering, and as a means of transport. The coastal area was a rich source of all kai moana. Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi exercised the values of Ngaa Raurutanga in both harvesting and conserving kai moana.

Ngaati Hine Waiata, and Ngaati Tai hapuu of the Waipipi (Waverley) area gathered food according to the values of Ngaa Raurutanga and kawa along the coast from the Patea River to Waipipi. Along the wider coastal area Rangitaawhi, Pukorokoro, Ngaati Hine, Kairakau, Ngaati Maika, and Manaia hapuu of the Patea area gathered food according to the values of Ngaa Raurutanga and kawa.

Ngaa Ariki, Ngaati Hou Tipua, Ngaati Pourua, Ngaati Hine Waiatarua, Ngaati Ruaiti, and Ngaati Maika gathered food according to the values of Ngaa Raurutanga and kawa along the coast from Waipipi to Mowhanau and the Kai Iwi stream.

Tamareheroto (Ngaati Pukeko and Ngaati Iti) exercised food gathering according to the values of Ngaa Raurutanga and kawa along the coast from the Okehu stream to the mouth of the Whanganui River, including from the fishing station of Kaihau a Kupe (at the mouth of the Whanganui River). Ngaa Kaainga at Kaihau a Kupe included Kaihokahoka (ki tai), Kokohuia (swampy area at Castlecliff), Te Whare Kakaho (Wordsworth St area), Pungarehu/Te Ahi Tuatini (Cobham bridge), Te Oneheke (between Karamu stream and Churton Creek), Patupuhou, Nukuiro, and Kaierau (St Johns Hill).

There are many sites of cultural, historical, and spiritual significance to Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi along the coastal area from the Patea River to the mouth of the Whanganui River. Important kaainga are situated along this coastal area. These include Tihoi Paa (where Te Rauparaha rested), which is situated between Rangitaawhi and the mouth of the Whenuakura River, Poopoia (Te kaainga a Aokehu), and Te Wai o Mahuku (near Te Ihonga). This coastal area includes outlets of streams and rivers that nourish and sustain Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi, such as Waipipi, Waiinu, Tapuarau Lagoon, the Ototoka Stream, the Okehu Stream, and the Kai Iwi Stream. Other areas of special significance to Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi include Taipake Tuturu, Tutaramoana (he kaitiaki moana), Tuaropaki, and Waikaramihi Marae along the coast from Tuaropaki.

The area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the area known as Hawkens Lagoon Conservation Area, the general location of which is indicated on SO 314758\.

#### Preamble

Under [section 40][60], the Crown acknowledges the statement by Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi of the cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association of Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi with the Hawkens Lagoon Conservation Area as set out below.

#### Cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association of Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi with statutory area

Tapuarau is the name given to the area at the mouth of the Waitotara River within the Tapuarau Conservation Area. The main hapuu of Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi that used Tapuarau included Ngaati Hine Waiatarua, Ngaati Hou Tipua, Ngaa Ariki, and Ngaati Ruaiti. Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi has used Tapuarau as a seasonal campsite from where it has gathered mahinga kai in accordance with the values of Ngaa Raurutanga. Tapuarau extends from the mouth of the Waitotara River to Pukeone and includes several small lagoons, including Tapuarau Lagoon, which are the source of tuna, flounder, mullet, whitebait, and inanga. During flooding, Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi was able to take tuna as it attempted to migrate from the nearby lagoons to the river mouth. The old marae named Hauriri was also situated in this area.

The area is still significant to Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi as a mahinga kai source from which the physical well-being of Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi is sustained, and the spiritual well-being is nourished.

## Schedule 7  
Statutory acknowledgement for Lake Beds Conservation Area

[s 40][60]

#### Statutory area

The area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the area known as Lake Beds Conservation Area, the general location of which is indicated on SO 314762\.

#### Preamble

Under [section 40][60], the Crown acknowledges the statement by Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi of the cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association of Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi with the Lake Beds Conservation Area as set out below.

#### Cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association of Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi with statutory area

## Schedule 8  
Statutory acknowledgement for Ototoka Scenic Reserve

[s 40][60]

#### Statutory area

The area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the area known as Ototoka Scenic Reserve, the general location of which is indicated on SO 314764\.

#### Preamble

Under [section 40][60], the Crown acknowledges the statement by Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi of the cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association of Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi with the Ototoka Scenic Reserve as set out below.

#### Cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association of Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi with statutory area

The Ototoka Scenic Reserve is adjacent to Pakaraka Marae. The Reserve and its surrounding area are of great cultural significance for the Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi hapuu of Ngaati Maika and Ngaati Ruaiti.

The name Ototoka refers to the abundance of shellrock and sands from its puna to Matangitonga (the mouth of the river) at Te Kiri o Rauru. In ancient times the local people built caves for shelter and to store food that sustained Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi hapuu and iwi. The caves maintained a steady temperature that made them ideal storage places. Some of these caves can still be seen today.

Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi have another significant site at Ototoka, just north of State Highway 3\. This site is significant for 2 reasons: it has a kaitiaki that protects the kai, and it also bears a tohu Aitua. The kaitiaki is in the form of a tuna, and to sight or catch a tuna here will inevitably lead to the death of that Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi person.

The tohu still stands today, and it is considered that, if a Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi person sights one, they have transgressed the tikanga of Ototoka.

#### Cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association of Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi with statutory area

Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi knows the Patea River by the name of Te Awanui o Taikehu. Te Awanui o Taikehu is the life force that has sustained all whaanau and hapuu of Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi who have resided along the banks of the Patea River, and within this area. Ngaa hapuu o Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi who settled along Te Awanui o Taikehu include Rangitaawhi, Pukorokoro, Ngaati Hine, Kairakau, Ngaati Maika I, and Manaia.

There are many paa and kaainga situated along Te Awanui o Taikehu. The Mangaehu Paa is situated near, and nourished by, Te Awanui o Taikehu.

Along the Patea River are Owhio, Kaiwaka, Arakirikiri, Nga-papa-tara-iwi, Tutumahoe Paa and kaainga. Further along Te Awanui o Taikehu sits Parikarangaranga, Rangitaawhi, and Wai-o-Turi Marae at the mouth of Te Awanui o Taikehu.

Wai-o-Turi Marae, which is situated above the south bank towards the mouth of Te Awanui o Taikehu, is the landing site of Turi (commander of the Aotea Waka) who came ashore to drink from the puni wai, hence the name of the marae, Wai-o-Turi.

Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi used the entire length of Te Awanui o Taikehu for food gathering. Sources of food included kakahi (fresh water mussels), tuna, whitebait, smelt, flounder, and sole.

## Schedule 12  
Toopuni site

[ss 85][118], [86][119]

#### Description of site

The site to which this schedule applies is the site known as Lake Beds Conservation Area, as shown marked ""pink"" on SO 314762\.

#### Statement of Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi values relating to Toopuni

##### Rauru of the gods, sky, lands, and seas

Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi emanated from the cosmogenic tree of the gods. It came by way of the legion of spirits who were not seen but heard, down through the generations of the Kaahui Rere and the genealogies of the ""immediate assembly of elders"". In this respect, Rauru is a progeny of both ""divine and human parentage"" and, therefore, so is Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi.

This divine origin is particular to the sacred, mystical, and theological insight of the people of Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi. The esoteric nature of these claims is expressed through their own pertinent whakapapa link. It is through a knowledge and awareness of this whakapapa that one is able to gain a perception of the attitudes of the tribe towards the almighty powers of the celestial realm, the cosmic emanations of the divine beginning, the world and its creation, and the evolution of earth and its people.

Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi makes a direct acclamation by stating its origins from the period of the Absolute Void to Rangi and Papa, to Rauru the man, and Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi the tribe. This claim draws together the spiritual and temporal manifestations of which Rauru is the central figure, it deals specifically with the origins of: the gods, man, vegetation, and taonga.

Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi has a spiritual and physical relationship through whakapapa to its taonga. It is espoused within mana atua, mana whenua, and mana tangata. These taonga encompass the expanses of Ranginui (sky), the vastness of Tangaroa (sea), and the immensity of Papa-tua-nuku (land), from the Te Awa nui o Taikehu Patea River inland to the Matemateaonga Ranges, seaward to the river mouth of Whanganui to our furthermost fishing boundaries to the south, Te Moana o Raukawa, and across the western horizon then back inland to Te Awa nui a Taikehu Patea.

Ngaa Raurutanga has been exercised in relation to Toopuni. These values have been practised in the following ways:

Te reo:Waiata and koorero relating to Toopuni are preserved in te reo.

Wairuatanga:The relationship between Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi and Toopuni is expressed in waiata, koorero, and karakia. Karakia, in particular, have always been used when harvesting kai. Wairua impacts upon the way in which individuals conduct themselves around kai, the harvesting of kai and the tikanga around the eating of kai.

Maatauranga:Maatauranga was passed on from one generation to another through karakia, waananga, and mihimihi. The knowledge that has been passed on includes the history of Toopuni and conservation methods exercised by Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi as kaitiaki of Toopuni.

Kaitiakitanga:Kaitiakitanga has been continuously practised through sustainable land and resource management methods. It was the responsibility of the hapuu to harvest only enough kai to sustain their own, and other Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi hapuu, and ensure the ongoing health and sustainability of Toopuni.

Waiora:Waiora manifests itself in individuals through the practice of te reo, wairuatanga, maatauranga, and kaitiakitanga, and in the fulfilment of an individual's responsibilities in relation to both Toopuni and to all of Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi.

Whakapapa:The relationship with Toopuni has been fostered through individuals' knowledge of the use and occupation of Toopuni that has been passed on throughout the generations.

#### Cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association of Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi with statutory area

The Lake Beds Conservation Area is located within the Moumahaki Lakes catchment area, and is situated inland above Kohi. These lakes and the surrounding area have great cultural significance for the Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi hapuu of Ngaa Ariki.

These lakes were the main food source for those hapuu.

Temporary kaainga and tuna weir were dotted along some of the lakes. Other food gathered from the lakes included kakahi and koura.

Special varieties of flaxes from around the lakes were used to make tuna traps and clothing.
