##### 7 Crown acknowledgements in English and te reo Maori
    
*   ###### Ngati Porou has honoured its Treaty obligations
    
    (1) The Crown acknowledges that, as a Treaty partner, Ngati Porou has fulfilled its obligations under the Treaty of Waitangi.
    
    (2) The Crown also acknowledges the significant contribution that Ngati Porou, its rangatira, whanau and hapu have made to New Zealand including military service in many parts of the world, as well as to the economy, education, farming, politics, culture, arts, public service, and business.
    
    (3) The Crown acknowledges that, despite Ngati Porou fulfilling its Treaty obligations, the Crown has breached the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles in a number of respects. The Crown also acknowledges that, despite Ngati Porou's significant contribution to New Zealand, it has failed to address the longstanding grievances of Ngati Porou in an appropriate manner, and that recognition of Ngati Porou grievances is long overdue.
    
    ###### Conflict in 1865 and its aftermath
    
    (4) The Crown acknowledges that some Ngati Porou today are aggrieved at the role of the Crown in the fighting on the East Coast in 1865\.
    
    (5) The Crown acknowledges that the detention without trial of some Ngati Porou who suffered in harsh conditions on the Chatham Islands for more than 2 years between 1866 and 1868 was an injustice and a breach of the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles.
    
    ###### Native land laws and Native Land Court
    
    (6) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) it did not consult Ngati Porou about the introduction of the native land laws; and
    
    *   (b) the resulting individualisation of land tenure was inconsistent with Ngati Porou tikanga; and
    
    *   (c) some key Crown goals in introducing these laws were to make Ngati Porou land available for European settlement, and eventually to detribalise Ngati Porou and assimilate them to European culture; and
    
    *   (d) the individualisation of land tenure made Ngati Porou land more susceptible to alienation, and quickly had a severe impact on Ngati Porou as nearly two thirds of their land had its title individualised between 1874 and 1886; and
    
    *   (e) the individualisation of land tenure also made Ngati Porou land susceptible to fragmentation and partition, making it difficult for Ngati Porou to access the benefits of the modern economy; and
    
    *   (f) it refused to provide a means for the collective administration of Ngati Porou land in the native land legislation until 1894 and this was a breach of the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles.
    
    (7) The Crown acknowledges that it promoted legislation that had the effect of allowing the sale of several Ngati Porou blocks to be completed despite these transactions having failed to comply with all the requirements of the native land laws that governed the alienation of Maori land at the time the transactions were entered into.
    
    (8) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) it required Ngati Porou to engage with the Native Land Court if they wanted to participate in the modern economy; and
    
    *   (b) the Court's processes could be expensive, disruptive, and were inconsistent with Ngati Porou tikanga; and that Ngati Porou had to sell some land to meet the costs of surveys that were part of this process.
    
    ###### Crown land purchasing
    
    (9) The Crown acknowledges that its land purchase agents sometimes opened negotiations to purchase Ngati Porou land without adequately identifying and consulting with all the owners.
    
    (10) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) it failed to exercise its monopoly powers in a reasonable manner when it purchased blocks such as Tapatu and Waitangirua and caused Ngati Porou to lose opportunities to lease these blocks; and
    
    *   (b) this misuse of its monopoly powers breached the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles.
    
    ###### Crown provisions for administration of Ngati Porou land
    
    (11) The Crown acknowledges that it failed to provide for Ngati Porou beneficial owners to be involved in the development of policy for the administration of their land vested in the East Coast Trust once it became clear that this Trust would have a long term existence, and that this was a breach of the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles.
    
    (12) The Crown acknowledges that it did not allow Ngati Porou to select any of the members of the Tairawhiti Maori Land Board. The Crown also acknowledges that the compulsory vesting of more than 35 000 acres of Ngati Porou land in this Board between 1906 and 1909 was a breach of the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles.
    
    ###### Native townships
    
    (13) The Crown acknowledges that its failure to seek consent from the landowners before establishing a township at Te Puia under the Native Townships Act 1895 was a breach of the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles.
    
    (14) The Crown acknowledges that the Native Townships Act 1895 allowed the Crown to take ownership of roads and public reserves in the townships without paying compensation to the owners.
    
    (15) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) it established Waipiro township closer to Te Puia than the 10 miles prescribed by the native townships legislation as the minimum distance required between townships; and
    
    *   (b) it was slow to distribute rents collected on some native townships on the East Coast; and
    
    *   (c) it did not fully comply with the valuation provisions of the native land laws when purchasing Te Puia township; and
    
    *   (d) it converted a number of fixed-term leases at Tuatini, Waipiro and Te Araroa to perpetual leases despite Ngati Porou's strong opposition.
    
    ###### Public works takings
    
    (16) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) it compulsorily acquired Ngati Porou land for public purposes on more than 2 000 occasions; and
    
    *   (b) some land was taken for roads without compensation; and
    
    *   (c) Ngati Porou lost some land of great importance in public works takings; and
    
    *   (d) the Crown's public works takings are a significant grievance for Ngati Porou.
    
    ###### Development schemes
    
    (17) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) its administration of development schemes deprived Ngati Porou of effective control of large areas of their land for many years; and
    
    *   (b) the Crown charged the costs of development schemes against the land for which they were incurred; and
    
    *   (c) the return of land to Ngati Porou control was frequently delayed by the need to reduce the large debts which had accumulated against development scheme land to manageable levels; and
    
    *   (d) some of the land returned to Ngati Porou from development schemes was returned carrying debt; and
    
    *   (e) the development schemes did not achieve the outcomes that Ngati Porou were led to expect, and it was difficult for Ngati Porou to farm profitably some of the land returned to them.
    
    ###### Consolidation schemes and amalgamation
    
    (18) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) the consolidation schemes carried out by the Crown of what were deemed to be ""uneconomic interests"" sometimes resulted in Ngati Porou losing their interests in land to which they had customary connections, and acquiring interests in land to which they had none; and
    
    *   (b) the consolidation schemes did not stop the process of fragmentation that continued as each successive generation died; and
    
    *   (c) owners in some blocks had their interests amalgamated into larger blocks for inclusion in development schemes against their wishes; and
    
    *   (d) no provision was made at the time of amalgamation for the owners of contributing blocks subsequently to withdraw their land.
    
    ###### Compulsory acquisition of uneconomic interests
    
    (19) The Crown acknowledges that the compulsory acquisition of uneconomic interests in Maori land between 1953 and 1974 by the Maori Trustee deprived many Ngati Porou of their turangawaewae.
    
    ###### Waiapu River and erosion
    
    (20) The Crown acknowledges the special relationship Ngati Porou have with the Waiapu River and that, in attempting to provide for the effective administration of the East Coast's natural resources, it vested control of that river in the Poverty Bay Catchment Board without consulting Ngati Porou.
    
    (21) The Crown acknowledges that deforestation in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries fuelled significant acceleration of erosion and flooding that has had a devastating impact on Ngati Porou rohe wide. It also acknowledges that the measures it adopted to address this problem failed effectively to resolve it.
    
    ###### Petroleum
    
    (22) The Crown acknowledges that its nationalisation of petroleum resources in New Zealand in 1937 caused a great sense of grievance within Ngati Porou that is still held today.
    
    ###### Socio-economic issues
    
    (23) The Crown acknowledges the significant harm Ngati Porou children suffered by being punished for speaking their own language in Crown-established schools for many decades. It also acknowledges that the education system historically had low expectations for Maori academic achievement, and that the educational achievements of students in East Coast schools have lagged well behind those of other New Zealand children.
    
    (24) The Crown acknowledges that its policies contributed to most Ngati Porou now living outside their rohe, and Ngati Porou living on the East Coast have endured social deprivation for too long.
    
    (25) The Crown acknowledges that the health of Ngati Porou living on the East Coast has been worse than that of many other New Zealanders, and they have not had the same opportunities in life that many other New Zealanders have enjoyed.

    *   (f) i takatakahia e Te Karauna te Tiriti o Waitangi me nga kaupapa o Te Tiriti, no te mea kare ke he ahuatanga i roto i nga Ture Whenua Maori a Te Karauna e ahei ai a Ngati Porou ki te whakahaere whakatoopu i o ratau whenua. No te tau 1894 katahi ano ka whakamanatia he ture e pa ana ki nga whakahaere whakatoopu nei.
    
    (7) E whakaae ana Te Karauna, nana tonu i whakahau ki a waihangatia nga ture ma reira nei e whakamana te hoko o etahi o nga whenua o Ngati Porou, ahakoa noa kare he mana o enei whakahaere i raro i nga ture whenua Maori, ara te ture whakamana i nga take raupatu i whakahaeretia ana i taua wa.
    
    (8) Kei te whakaae hoki Te Karauna nana i kii---
        
    *   (a) mehemea e hiahia ana a Ngati ki te whakauru atu ki nga mahi whakatipu rawa i wenei ra, me mahi tahi ratau i raro i nga take whakahaere o Te Kooti Whenua Maori; a

Na te tino nui o te utu mo enei whakahaere, me enei kaupapa i hoko ai a Ngati Porou i wetahi o o ratau whenua hei utu i nga mahi ruri whenua.
    
    ###### Te mahi hoko whenua a Te Karauna
    
    (9) He wa na ka panui whanuitia e nga kaihoko a Te Karauna a ratau kaupapa mo te hoko i nga whenua o Ngati Porou. Ko te raruraru ke o enei o a ratau whakahaere, kare nga kaihoko a Te Karauna e marama ana ko wai nga mea tika hei korerotanga atu ma ratau mo a ratau kaupapa hoko whenua.
    
    (10) Ka whakaae hoki Te Karauna---
        
    *   (a) kei te tautoko hoki Te Karauna, i tino hapa ana whakamahi i ana mana huhua, no te mea kare, i tika tana whakamana i aua mana e pa ana ki te hokotanga mai o Tapatu me Waitangirua, a, na enei ahuatanga i aukati te tango riihi a Ngati Porou ki enei whenua:
    
    *   (b) na te hapa, me te he o nga mahi a Te Karauna i takatakahi Te Tiriti o Waitangi me nga kaupapa hoki o Te Tiriti.
    
    (11) I takatakahia e Te Karauna Te Tiriti o Waitangi me nga kaupapa o te Tiriti, no te mea i mahi he Te Karauna, ina hoki kare ke he wahanga i tukua atu ki te iwi kaenga hei whakarite i nga kaupapa whakahaere mo o ratau whenua i tukua atu ra ki nga whakahaere a te East Coast Trust, ahakoa noa e mohio ana Te Karauna, ka noho roa enei whakahaere ki nga ringa o te Trust.
    
    (12) E tautoko ana Te Karauna i takatakahia e a ia Te Tiriti o Waitangi me nga kaupapa o Te Tiriti no te mea kare i whakaingoatia e a ia he tangata no Ngati Porou hei mema mo Te Tairawhiti Maori Land Board. E whakaae ana ano hoki Te Karauna neke atu i te 35000 eka nga whenua o Ngati Porou i taka ki raro o tenei Poari i waenganui o nga tau 1906 me 1909\.
    
    ###### Nga ""township"" Maori
    
    (13) E tautoko ana Te Karauna i takatakahia e a ia Te Tiriti o Waitangi me nga kaupapa o Te Tiriti no to mea kare a ia i kimi i te whakaaetanga a te hunga no ratau aua whenua i mua i te whakamanatanga o te ""township"" o Te Puia i raro i te Native Townships Act 1895\.
    
    (14) E kii ana Te Karauna ko tana mana ki nga rori, ki nga whenua i rahuitia mo nga tangata katoa mo te kore utu, a, me te kore tuku utu kopaheina ranei ki te iwi kaenga, kei raro i te mana o te Ture Native Townships Act 1895\. Heoi, na enei mahi a Te Karauna, i takatakahi Te Tiriti o Waitangi me nga kaupapa o Te Tiriti.
    
    (15) Kei te whakaae Te Karauna---
        
    *   (a) nana i whakatu te Waipiro township kia tu tata ki te township o Te Puia, i runga ano o te mohio kare ke tenei whakahau i noho tika ana i raro i te ture o nga Maori townships no te mea, e noho marama ana te ture me te kau maero te tawhiti o ia township i tetahi atu:

    *   (a) na nga kaupapa whakahaere a Te Karauna i enei whenua, i aukati, te mana whakahaere o Ngati Porou, ki o ratau panga whenua tino kaita rawa atu mo nga tau tokomaha rawa atu:
    
    *   (b) ko nga nama ahuwhenua i uhia atu e Te Karauna ki ia whenua kei raro i tenei whakahaere:
    
    *   (c) i tomuri ai te whakahoki atu o nga whenua nei ki a Ngati Porou, na te hiahia o Te Karauna ki a heke iho te kaita o nga nama kei nga whenua nei, kia ngawari ai nga whakahaere o nga whenua nei, a:
    
    *   (d) i whakahokia atu etahi o nga whenua nei ki a Ngati Porou me nga nama e mau tonu ana:
    
    *   (e) na Te Karauna i whakapuaki nga hua ka puta i nga momo ahuwhenua nei, engari, kare i mana nga korero a Te Karauna, a, kare hoki i ea nga tumanako o Ngati Porou. Heoi he mahi tino uaua rawa atu ma Ngati Porou ki te whakatipu rawa i nga paamu kua whakahokia mai nei ki a ratau.
    
    (18) Consolidation schemes and amalgamations (Whakatopu me te Whakamoana)---
        
    *   (a) he kaupapa muru whenua nga whakahaere whakatopu a Te Karauna e pa ana, ki nga ""uneconomic interests"" no te mea, ka murua nga panga whenua tipu o te tangata, i heke mai ra i ona tipuna, a, katahi ka whakanohoa te tangata ki nga whenua, kare nei ona take tipuna ki aua whenua:
    
    *   (b) kare e taea e nga take whakatopu nei te arai atu i te whakuruuru mai a nga uri tokomaha ki roto ki nga whenua nei, a, ka mau tonu tenei ahuatanga mai i tena whakatipuranga ki tetahi atu whakatipuranga:
    
    *   (c) ahakoa te whakahe a te iwi no ratau nga panga whenua kaita pera me nga ""development schemes"" ra, ka haere tonu nga mahi whakamoana taitara a Te Karauna:
    
    *   (d) kare he kaupapa i whakaritea i raro i nga take whakamoana nei, mo te hunga e hiahia ana ki te whakaputa mai i o ratau whenua i waho o nga whenua whakamoana.
    
    ###### Nga muru o nga ""uneconomic interests""
    
    (19) E whakaae ana Te Karauna na ana kaupapa muru i nga ""uneconomic interests"" i raro i te mana o Te Maori Trustee mai i te tau 1953 ki te tau 1973 i kore turangawaewae ai nga hunga tokomaha rawa atu o Ngati Porou.
    
    ###### Waiapu Awa me nga horohoro (The Waiapu River and erosion)
    
    (20) E whakaae ana Te Karauna he tino nui rawa atu te piri pono o Ngati Porou ki te awa o Waiapu, engari i roto i nga whiringa a Te Karauna hei a wai nga mahi whakahaere i nga rawa o nga whenua o te Rawhiti, ka tukua atu e Te Karauna te mana ki te Poverty Bay Catchment Board, engari kore rawa tetahi kupu kotahi nei a Ngati Porou mo wenei whakaritenga.
    
    (21) E whakaae ana ano hoki Te Karauna, na nga mahi turaki i nga ngahere i nga tau whakamutunga o te 20th Century i whakatere te horo haere o nga whenua, a, me nga waipuke hoki i pa ki roto o Ngati Porou. He tino kino rawa atu te panga o enei ahuatanga ki nga rohenga whanui o Ngati Porou. Ka whakaae ano hoki Te Karauna, kare he painga o nga whakahaere i whakaritea e ratau hei whakaora i nga horohoro e pa nei ki te whenua me nga waipuke e whakaruke nei i te rohe.
    
    ###### Petroleum (hinu)
    
    (22) Kei te tautoko Te Karauna, na tana waihanga he ture i te tau 1937 ki te whakamana hei a ia tuturu te mana mo nga hinu kei Niu Tirena i tino mamae ai a Ngati Porou mo tenei mahi a Te Karauna a, e mau tonu ana te mamae i te ra nei.
    
    ###### Socio-economic issues
    
    (23) E tautoko ana Te Karauna i te nui o nga kino kua heipu ki nga tamariki o Ngati Porou no te mea i whiua ratau mo nga tau tokomaha rawa atu ki te korero i to ratau ake reo ki roto ki nga kura o Te Karauna. Ko tetahi atu take, ko te iti o te whakapono tera ka taea e te Maori nga taumata o te matauranga, no te mea, kei muri rawa atu nga taumata o te matauranga o nga tamariki kei nga kura o te Rawhiti i era atu o nga tamariki o Niu Tireni. 
    
    (24) E tautoko ana ano hoki Te Karauna ko ana kaupapa tetahi o nga take i noho marara ai te nuinga o Ngati Porou ki waho ake i to ratau rohe a, na nga kaupapa ano nei hoki i noho whakamomori ai a Ngati Porou no te mea kare nga awhina-a-iwi i puta ngawari mai ki a ratau.
    
    (25) E tautoko ana hoki Te Karauna he kino rawa atu nga oranga tinana o nga Ngati Porou e noho mai ra i te Rawhiti, i nga oranga tinana o te nuinga atu o nga tangata o Niu Tireni, a, kare hoki te orite nga painga i te puta ki a ratau, pera me nga painga e kaiponohia mai ra e era atu o nga tangata o Niu Tireni.

    (2) Contracts and other instruments are binding on, and enforceable by, against, or in favour of, the trustee as if the contracts or other instruments had been entered into by, made with, given to or by, or addressed to or by, the trustee and not Te Runanga.

##### 140 Status of existing securities
    
*   (1) A security held by Te Runanga as security for a debt or other liability to the board of Te Runanga incurred before the commencement of this Act---

##### 143 Registers
    
*   (1) The Registrar-General or any other person charged with keeping books or registers is not required to change the name of Te Runanga to the names of the trustee in the books or registers or in a document, solely because of the provisions of this subpart.
    
    (2) If the trustee presents an instrument referred to in subsection (3) to a registrar or other person, the presentation of that instrument is, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, sufficient proof that the property is vested in the trustee, as specified in the instrument.
    
    (3) For the purposes of this section, the instrument need not be an instrument of transfer, but must---
        
    *   (a) be executed or purport to be executed by the trustee; and
    
    *   (b) relate to assets or liabilities held, managed, or controlled by Te Runanga or any entity wholly or partly owned or controlled by the board of Te Runanga immediately before the commencement of this Act; and

##### 144 Interpretation
    
*   In [sections 145 to 149][191], _transferred employee_ means a person employed by Te Runanga immediately before the commencement of this Act who becomes an employee of the trustee on the commencement of this Act.

##### 145 Liability of employees and agents
    
*   (1) A person who, at any time before the commencement of this Act, held office as a member of Te Runanga or who was an officer, employee, agent, or representative of that board, is not personally liable in respect of an act or thing done or omitted to be done by him or her before the commencement of this Act in the exercise or bona fide purported exercise of an authority conferred by or under the [Maori Trust Boards Act 1955][338] or any other enactment.
    
    (2) This section applies only---
        
    *   (a) in the absence of actual fraud; and
    
    *   (b) if the act or omission does not amount to an offence under any enactment or rule of law.
    
    

##### 146 Transfer of employees
    
*   On and from the commencement of this Act, each employee of Te Runanga ceases to be an employee of the board and becomes an employee of the trustee.

##### 147 Protection of terms and conditions of employment
    
*   (1) The employment of a transferred employee must be on terms and conditions no less favourable to the transferred employee than those applying to the employee immediately before the commencement of this Act.
    
    (2) Subsection (1)---
        
    *   (a) continues to apply to the terms and conditions of employment of a transferred employee until they are varied by agreement between the transferred employee and the trustee; and
    
    *   (b) does not apply to a transferred employee who receives any subsequent appointment with the trustee.
    
    

##### 148 Continuity of employment
    
*   For the purposes of an enactment, rule of law, determination, contract, or agreement relating to the employment of a transferred employee, the transfer of the employee from Te Runanga to the trustee does not, of itself, break the employment of that person, and the period of his or her employment by Te Runanga is to be regarded as having been a period of service with the trustee.

##### 149 No compensation for technical redundancy
    
*   A transferred employee is not entitled to receive any payment or any other benefit solely on the ground that---
        
    *   (a) the position held by the employee with Te Runanga has ceased to exist; or
    
    *   (b) the employee has ceased, as a result of his or her transfer to the trustee, to be an employee of Te Runanga.

    (3) Income derived or expenditure incurred by Te Runanga before the assets and liabilities become those of the trustee does not become income derived or expenditure incurred by the trustee just because the assets and liabilities become those of the trustee under [section 131(1)(a)][175].
    
    (4) Subsection (5) applies if income of Te Runanga---
        
    *   (a) is derived from a financial arrangement, trading stock, revenue account property, or depreciable property; and
    
    *   (b) is exempt income of Te Runanga but is not exempt income of the trustee.

    > is the total amounts derived by Te Runanga that, but for the application of [sections CW 41][344] and [CW 42][345] of the Income Tax Act 2007, would have been taxable income derived by Te Runanga before the commencement of this Act
    
    **y**
    > 
    > is the amounts described in x that have been distributed before the commencement of this Act.
    
    (7) The undistributed charitable amounts described in subsection (6) are excluded from the corpus of the trustee for the purposes of the [Income Tax Act 2007][346], to the extent to which they are otherwise included but for this subsection.
    
    (8) If the trustee distributes an undistributed charitable amount to a person, that amount is treated as beneficiary income for the purposes of the [Income Tax Act 2007][346], unless subsection (9) applies.
    
    (9) If the trustee distributes an undistributed charitable amount for a charitable purpose, the distribution is exempt income of the recipient.

    *   (a) exempt income if the distribution is applied for a charitable purpose; or
    
    *   (b) a taxable Maori authority distribution.
    
    (2) If this section applies, the amount must be disregarded for the purposes of [section HF 8][348] of the Income Tax Act 2007\.
    
    Section 152(1): amended, on 12 December 2012, by [section 6][349] of the Ngati Porou Claims Settlement Amendment Act 2012 (2012 No 111).

*   (1) This section applies provided---
        
    *   (a) the assets and liabilities of the relevant subsidiaries remain the assets and liabilities of those subsidiaries; and
    
    *   (b) income of a relevant subsidiary derived from a financial arrangement, trading stock, revenue account property, or depreciable property is exempt income of that subsidiary before the commencement of this Act, and ceases to be exempt income as a result of the application of [section 131(4)][175].
    
    (2) The subsidiary is to be treated as having acquired the financial arrangement, trading stock, revenue account, or depreciable property for a consideration that is its market value on the date of the commencement of this Act.

##### 154 Election by relevant subsidiary to be Maori authority
    
*   (1) If a relevant subsidiary makes an election under [section HF 11][347] of the Income Tax Act 2007 to become a Maori authority, income derived by the subsidiary before the commencement of this Act that was exempt income under [sections CW 41][344] and [CW 42][345] of that Act must be treated as a taxable Maori authority distribution if, after the commencement of this Act, it is distributed by the subsidiary in an income year.
    
    (2) If this section applies, the distribution must be disregarded for the purposes of [section HF 8][348] of the Income Tax Act 2007\.
