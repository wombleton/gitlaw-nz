#### Historical account, acknowledgements, and apology for Ngāti Kōata

##### 8 Summary of historical account for Ngāti Kōata
    
*   The historical account set out in the deed of settlement for Ngāti Kōata is summarised as follows:
    
    (1) Ngāti Kōata first came to Te Tau Ihu (the northern South Island) in the mid-1820s after receiving a tuku of land from Tūtepourangi, and also as part of an invasion. Ngāti Kōata primarily settled at Rangitoto Island, Croisilles, Whakapuaka, and Whakatū.
    
    (2) In 1839 the New Zealand Company signed deeds with other iwi that purported to purchase the entire northern South Island. The following year several Ngāti Kōata chiefs signed the [Treaty of Waitangi][298] at Rangitoto Island.
    
    (3) In 1842 the Company presented gifts to local Māori upon establishing its Nelson settlement. In 1844 a Crown-appointed commissioner investigated the Company's purchases. He heard only one Māori witness in Nelson before suspending the inquiry to enable the Company to negotiate a settlement. Māori signed deeds of release in return for accepting payments described by the commissioner as gifts to assist settlement rather than payments for the land.
    
    (4) In 1845, on the commissioner's recommendation, the Crown prepared a Company grant of 151 000 acres in Tasman and Golden Bays, which would have reserved 15 100 acres for Māori. However, the Company objected to several aspects of this grant. In 1848 the Company accepted a new Crown grant for a larger area of land that reserved only 5 053 acres at Nelson and Motueka, and areas in the Wairau and Golden Bay.
    
    (5) Ngāti Kōata had negligible involvement in the administration of the Nelson and Motueka reserves, known as "Tenths", which were leased to settlers to generate income that was spent on Māori purposes. From 1887 the Tenths were let under perpetually renewable leases. Rentals were infrequently reviewed and over time inflation reduced rental returns. During the twentieth century the Tenths were reduced by the compulsory acquisition of uneconomic shares and the sale of reserves.
    
    (6) In 1852 the Crown purchased the mineral-rich Pakawau block and paid only for its agricultural value. In 1853 the Crown signed the Waipounamu deed with other iwi, and purported to have purchased most of the remaining Māori land in Te Tau Ihu. Ngāti Kōata did not sign the deed, but were to receive a share of the purchase money. The Crown used the 1853 deed as the basis for negotiations with resident Ngāti Kōata in 1856, which led to the alienation of most of their remaining interests for £100\. Rangitoto Island was excluded from this purchase.
    
    (7) The reserves created for Ngāti Kōata from the Waipounamu sale were mostly inadequate for customary use or effective development. In 1883 and 1892 the Native Land Court awarded ownership of the reserves and Rangitoto Island to individual Ngāti Kōata. Over time, sales and successions to the titles made the lands increasingly fragmented and uneconomic.
    
    (8) In 1883 Ngāti Kōata participated in the Native Land Court's title investigation of Whakapuaka. Ngāti Kōata claimed interests on the basis of the tuku and ongoing occupation. The Court deemed that Ngāti Kōata did not have interests and they were excluded from ownership. Ngāti Kōata were again excluded at a rehearing of the block in 1937\.
    
    (9) By the late nineteenth century, some Ngāti Kōata were virtually landless. In 1894 the Crown allocated some landless Ngāti Kōata individuals land at Te Māpou and Te Raetihi, but did not issue titles to them until 1968\.
    
    (10) Ngāti Kōata struggled to secure safe drinking water and social services on their reserves and Rangitoto Island well into the twentieth century. Many Ngāti Kōata came to Nelson for work and educational and health purposes. A Māori hostel in Nelson used by Ngāti Kōata families was frequently overcrowded resulting in unhygienic conditions.
    
    (11) By the end of the twentieth century most of Ngāti Kōata's remaining land, including their reserves and Rangitoto Island, had been sold. Ngāti Kōata had also lost ownership or access to several islands surrounding Rangitoto and in Croisilles Harbour. Virtual landlessness has meant that Ngāti Kōata has lost connection and access to many of their traditional resources and sites, and the demise of a strong cultural base.

##### 9 Text of acknowledgements for Ngāti Kōata
    
*   The text of the acknowledgements set out in the deed of settlement for Ngāti Kōata is as follows:
    
    (1) The Crown acknowledges that it has failed to deal with the long-standing grievances of Ngāti Kōata in an appropriate way and that recognition of these grievances is long overdue.
    
    (2) The Crown acknowledges that it failed to adequately inform itself of and protect the interests, including the ongoing needs, of Ngāti Kōata during the process by which land was granted to the New Zealand Company in 1848, and this failure was a breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi][298] and its principles.
    
    (3) The Crown acknowledges that in the reserves that became known as the Nelson and Motueka "tenths" it failed to ensure that the area ultimately reserved was sufficient for the ongoing use and benefit of Ngāti Kōata. The Crown acknowledges that this failure was in breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi][298] and its principles.
    
    (4) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) Ngāti Kōata had negligible involvement in the administration of the tenths reserves between 1842 and 1977:
    
    *   (b) on occasion, the Crown used tenths funds as a partial replacement to government spending:
    
    *   (c) it was not until 1892, several decades after the establishment of the tenths, that the beneficiaries of the tenths fund were identified.
    
    (5) The Crown acknowledges that certain actions and omissions with respect to the administration of the Nelson and Motueka tenths reserves, including the imposition of a regime of perpetually renewable leases, and permitting the Māori Trustee to sell "uneconomic interests" and tenths land in the twentieth century, resulted in prejudice to those Ngāti Kōata who held a beneficial interest in the tenths reserves fund and were in breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi][298] and its principles.
    
    (6) The Crown acknowledges that in 1852 it sought to purchase the Pakawau block before Ngāti Kōata and other Māori became aware of the full potential value of its minerals, and the price paid reflected the agricultural value of the land only.
    
    (7) The Crown acknowledges that when it purchased most of the remaining Māori land in Te Tau Ihu between 1853 and 1856---
        
    *   (a) it did not negotiate with Ngāti Kōata as an iwi prior to signing the 1853 Te Waipounamu deed, and used the 1853 deed as the basis for its negotiations with resident Ngāti Kōata in 1856, whereby Ngāti Kōata alienated most of their remaining interests for a small price; and
    
    *   (b) it did not set aside adequate reserves for the present and future needs of Ngāti Kōata in Te Tau Ihu.
    
    The Crown acknowledges that it failed to adequately protect the interests of Ngāti Kōata when purchasing their land and this was a breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi][298] and its principles.
    
    (8) The Crown acknowledges that the operation and impact of the native land laws on the remaining lands of Ngāti Kōata, in particular the awarding of land to individual Ngāti Kōata rather than to iwi or hapū, made those lands more susceptible to partition, fragmentation, and alienation. This further contributed to the erosion of the traditional tribal structures of Ngāti Kōata. The Crown failed to take adequate steps to protect those structures and this was a breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi][298] and its principles.
    
    (9) The Crown acknowledges that the alienation of the Whakapuaka block has remained a significant grievance for Ngāti Kōata down to the present day. The Crown also acknowledges that it did not take steps to effect a reinvestigation of the Whakapuaka case until 1936\.
    
    (10) The Crown acknowledges that it failed to issue title to the Ngāti Kōata owners of the Te Māpou and Te Raetihi ""landless natives"" reserves until 1968\. The Crown's failure to implement the scheme effectively meant that it did nothing to alleviate the landless position of those Ngāti Kōata in Te Tau Ihu and this was a breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi][298] and its principles.
    
    (11) The Crown acknowledges that since 1856 much of Ngāti Kōata's reserve land, Rangitoto Island, and its surrounding islands, including Puangiangi and Whakaterepapanui, have been alienated from Ngāti Kōata ownership. This included the Crown's acquisition of Takapourewa Island for public works purposes and purchase of part of Whangarae reserve for scenery preservation purposes.
    
    (12) The Crown acknowledges that several islands at the entrance to Croisilles Harbour continued to be used by Ngāti Kōata as mahinga kai following their sale to the Crown in 1856\. The Crown also acknowledges that when it declared the islands as scenic reserves in 1980 this detrimentally impacted on Ngāti Kōata's customary use of the islands.
    
    (13) The Crown acknowledges that it made several attempts to acquire ownership of Kurupongi Island from Ngāti Kōata. The Crown also acknowledges that by gazetting Kurupongi as a wildlife sanctuary in 1957 the Crown took effective control of the island, although Ngāti Kōata retained ownership and mutton-birding rights.
    
    (14) The Crown acknowledges that the cumulative effect of the Crown's actions and omissions left Ngāti Kōata virtually landless. The Crown's failure to ensure that Ngāti Kōata retained sufficient land was a breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi][298] and its principles.
    
    (15) The Crown acknowledges that the discouragement of the use of Te Reo Māori in Native Schools established in areas where Ngāti Kōata lived detrimentally impacted on the retention of Ngāti Kōata culture.
    
    (16) The Crown acknowledges that the isolation and poor quality of their reserve land at Croisilles and Rangitoto, and the lack or slow delivery of social services in these areas, resulted in poor economic and health conditions for Ngāti Kōata communities. The Crown also acknowledges that these circumstances forced many Ngāti Kōata to leave their land and seek economic, social, and educational opportunities elsewhere, including outside of Te Tau Ihu.
    
    (17) The Crown acknowledges that through the alienation of most of their land Ngāti Kōata have lost control over many of their significant sites and resources. This has had an ongoing impact on the ability of Ngāti Kōata to maintain spiritual connections to their ancestral lands.

##### 10 Text of apology for Ngāti Kōata
    
*   The text of the apology set out in the deed of settlement for Ngāti Kōata is as follows:
    
    (1) The Crown makes the following apology to Ngāti Kōata, to their ancestors, and to their descendants.
    
    (2) When Ngāti Kōata rangatira signed the [Treaty of Waitangi][298] at Rangitoto Island in May 1840, they entered into a relationship with the Crown based on hope and mutual respect. However, the Crown accepts and is deeply sorry that it has not always fulfilled its obligations under the Treaty of Waitangi and, for this, unreservedly apologises to Ngāti Kōata.
    
    (3) The Crown regrets and apologises for its failure to properly respect the rangatiratanga of Ngāti Kōata. Crown actions, moreover, left Ngāti Kōata virtually landless in Te Tau Ihu and alienated them from many of their most sacred sites. For this too the Crown apologises. Their disconnection from their lands marginalised Ngāti Kōata in the economic development of Te Tau Ihu, and had devastating consequences for the social, cultural, and spiritual well-being of Ngāti Kōata. Those consequences continue to be felt today.
    
    (4) With this apology and settlement the Crown seeks to atone for its wrongs. The Crown hopes that through this apology and settlement it can build a new, positive, and enduring relationship with Ngāti Kōata based on mutual trust and co-operation and respect for the [Treaty of Waitangi][298] and its principles.

#### Historical account, acknowledgements, and apology for Ngāti Rārua

##### 11 Summary of historical account for Ngāti Rārua
    
*   The historical account set out in the deed of settlement for Ngāti Rārua is summarised as follows:
    
    (1) Ngāti Rārua came to the northern South Island in the late 1820s. Ngāti Rārua established pā and kainga at Te Tai Tapu, Golden Bay, Tasman Bay, and Wairau.
    
    (2) In 1839 the New Zealand Company signed deeds with Māori that purported to purchase the entire northern South Island. No Ngāti Rārua resident in the west of the northern South Island signed the Company deeds. In 1842 the Company presented gifts to local Māori, including Ngāti Rārua, upon establishing its Nelson settlement. Ngāti Rārua expressed an interest in European settlement, but denied that the 1839 transactions had effected a sale of their land.
    
    (3) In 1844 a Crown-appointed commissioner investigated the Company's purchases. He heard from only one Māori witness in Nelson, who was Ngāti Rārua, before suspending the inquiry to enable the company to negotiate a settlement. Local Māori signed deeds of release in return for accepting payments described by the commissioner as gifts to assist settlement rather than payments for the land. A share of the money was set aside for Golden Bay Ngāti Rārua not present at the commissioner's hearing or arbitration.
    
    (4) In 1845, on the commissioner's recommendation, the Crown prepared a grant to the New Zealand Company of 151 000 acres of land in Tasman and Golden Bays, which would have reserved 15 100 acres for Māori. However, the Company objected to several aspects of this grant. In 1848 the Company accepted a new Crown grant for a larger area of land that reserved only 5 053 acres at Nelson and Motueka, and areas in Wairau and Golden Bay.
    
    (5) Ngāti Rārua had negligible involvement in the administration of the Nelson and Motueka reserves, known as "Tenths". Most were leased to settlers to generate income that was spent on Māori purposes. In the 1850s and 1860s the Crown allocated a number of Motueka Tenths sections to Ngāti Rārua for their occupation. However, ownership of these lands was not granted separately to Ngāti Rārua. From 1887 the Tenths were leased under perpetually renewable leases. Rentals were infrequently reviewed and over time inflation reduced rental returns. During the twentieth century the Tenths were reduced by the compulsory acquisition of uneconomic shares and the sale of reserves.
    
    (6) In 1847 the Crown purchased the Wairau district from three North Island chiefs. No other right holders, including Ngāti Rārua, were consulted or involved in the transaction. In 1852, the Crown purchased the mineral-rich Pakawau block, paying only for its agricultural value. The 1853 Te Waipounamu deed purported to purchase all remaining land in the region. Ngāti Rārua in the west of the northern South Island did not sign the deed, but were to receive a share of the purchase money. Ngāti Rārua protested the Crown's actions, but it was not until 1855 that the Crown met with resident Māori to finalise the purchase. During these negotiations the Crown applied pressure on Ngāti Rārua, including presenting their land as already sold. Ngāti Rārua and another iwi were paid £600 for their remaining interests in Te Waipounamu. The reserves created by the Crown for Ngāti Rārua from the Waipounamu purchase, particularly at Wairau and Pukatea, were generally inadequate for customary use or agricultural farming.
    
    (7) Ngāti Rārua had excluded the 88 350 acre Te Tai Tapu block from the Waipounamu sale. In 1873 the Crown took effective control of Te Tai Tapu to regulate gold mining on the land. However, Ngāti Rārua obtained little financial benefit from the arrangement. In 1883 Ngāti Rārua sold the block.
    
    (8) By the late nineteenth century, Ngāti Rārua were virtually landless. At this time the Crown allocated landless Ngāti Rārua individuals land on Stewart Island, but never granted them title to the land.
    
    (9) In the decades following the major land purchases of the mid-nineteenth century, the socio-economic position of Ngāti Rārua and the Māori population of the northern South Island became characterised by marginal economic status, poor health, and low educational attainment.

##### 12 Text of acknowledgements for Ngāti Rārua
    
*   The text of the acknowledgements set out in the deed of settlement for Ngāti Rārua is as follows:
    
    (1) The Crown acknowledges that it has failed to deal with the long-standing grievances of Ngāti Rārua in an appropriate way and that recognition of these grievances is long overdue.
    
    (2) The Crown acknowledges that it failed to adequately inform itself of and protect the interests, including the ongoing needs, of Ngāti Rārua during the process by which land was granted to the New Zealand Company in 1848, and this failure was a breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi][298] and its principles.
    
    (3) The Crown acknowledges that when it purchased most of the remaining Māori land in Te Tau Ihu between 1847 and 1856---
        
    *   (a) it did not deal with Ngāti Rārua in its negotiation of the 1847 Wairau purchase:
    
    *   (b) it did not negotiate with Ngāti Rārua in Te Tau Ihu prior to signing the 1853 Te Waipounamu deed and applied heavy pressure in its negotiations with resident Ngāti Rārua in 1855, including presenting the land as already sold:
    
    *   (c) it did not set aside adequate reserves for the present and future needs of Ngāti Rārua in Te Tau Ihu.
    
    The Crown acknowledges that it failed to adequately protect the interests of Ngāti Rārua when purchasing their land and this was a breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi][298] and its principles.
    
    (4) The Crown acknowledges that it sought to purchase the Pakawau block before Ngāti Rārua and other Māori became aware of the full potential value of its minerals, and the price paid reflected the agricultural value of the land only.
    
    (5) The Crown acknowledges that the absence of defined interior boundaries in the 1855 Te Waipounamu deed with Ngāti Rārua contributed to later uncertainty among Ngāti Rārua over what they had alienated and numerous applications to the Native Land Court in 1883 for land they considered they had not sold.
    
    (6) The Crown acknowledges that in the reserves that became known as the Nelson and Motueka "tenths" it failed to adequately provide for Ngāti Rārua to control those lands they occupied and used, and failed to ensure that the area ultimately reserved was sufficient for the ongoing use and benefit of Ngāti Rārua. The Crown acknowledges that these failures were in breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi][298] and its principles.
    
    (7) The Crown acknowledges that the grant of tenths land at Whakarewa in 1853 meant that some Ngāti Rārua whanau had to move from land they were occupying at the time. The Crown further acknowledges that despite protests from Māori beginning in 1881 the Whakarewa lands were not returned until 1993\.
    
    (8) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) Ngāti Rārua had negligible involvement in the administration of the tenths reserves between 1842 and 1977:
    
    *   (b) on occasion, the Crown used tenths funds as a partial replacement to government spending:
    
    *   (c) it was not until 1892, several decades after the establishment of the tenths, that the beneficiaries of the tenths fund were identified.
    
    (9) The Crown acknowledges that certain actions and omissions with respect to the administration of the Nelson and Motueka tenths reserves, including the imposition of a regime of perpetually renewable leases, and permitting the Māori Trustee to sell "uneconomic interests" and tenths land in the twentieth century, resulted in prejudice to those Ngāti Rārua who held a beneficial interest in the tenths reserves fund and were in breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi][298] and its principles.
    
    (10) The Crown acknowledges that the operation and impact of the native land laws on the remaining lands of Ngāti Rārua, in particular the awarding of land to individual Ngāti Rārua rather than to iwi or hapū, made those lands more susceptible to partition, fragmentation, and alienation. This further contributed to the erosion of the traditional tribal structures of Ngāti Rārua. The Crown failed to take adequate steps to protect those structures and this was a breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi][298] and its principles.
    
    (11) The Crown acknowledges that the Wairau reserve had only a small area of cultivatable land and its flood-prone nature limited the effectiveness of the development scheme that operated on the reserve during the mid-twentieth century.
    
    (12) The Crown acknowledges that owing to its isolation and poor quality the Pukatea reserve provided little return to the Ngāti Rārua owners. The Crown further acknowledges that Ngāti Rārua felt that considerable public pressure contributed to their decision to sell their land at Pukatea to the Crown in the 1950s.
    
    (13) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) the Ngāti Rārua rangatira Riwai Turangapeke excluded the Te Tai Tapu block from the Crown's Te Waipounamu purchase:
    
    *   (b) between 1862 and 1873 the Crown did not properly manage the issuing of licences and collection of fees from gold miners on Te Tai Tapu:
    
    *   (c) in 1873 Ngāti Rārua gave up effective control of Te Tai Tapu to the Crown in order to properly regulate gold mining on the block:
    
    *   (d) between 1862 and 1883 Ngāti Rārua obtained little financial benefit from its agreements with the Crown to allow gold mining on Te Tai Tapu.
    
    (14) The Crown acknowledges that the cumulative effect of the Crown's actions and omissions left Ngāti Rārua virtually landless. The Crown's failure to ensure that Ngāti Rārua retained sufficient land was a breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi][298] and its principles.
    
    (15) The Crown acknowledges that members of Ngāti Rārua were never issued title to land allocated to them on Stewart Island under the ""landless natives"" scheme. The Crown's failure to implement the scheme effectively meant that it did nothing to alleviate the landless position of those Ngāti Rārua in Te Tau Ihu and this was a breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi][298] and its principles.

##### 13 Text of apology for Ngāti Rārua
    
*   The text of the apology set out in the deed of settlement for Ngāti Rārua is as follows:
    
    (1) The Crown sincerely offers the following apology to Ngāti Rārua, to their tūpuna, and to their descendants.
    
    (2) The Crown recognises the efforts and struggles of Ngāti Rārua and their tūpuna over several generations in pursuit of justice.
    
    (3) The Crown is deeply sorry that it has not fulfilled its obligations to Ngāti Rārua under Te Tiriti o Waitangi/the [Treaty of Waitangi][298] and, for this, unreservedly apologises to Ngāti Rārua.
    
    (4) The Crown admits it did not include Ngāti Rārua in its purchase of the Wairau district in 1847, and only belatedly recognised Ngāti Rārua interests in its Te Waipounamu purchase. The Crown apologises for these failures to recognise the rangatiratanga of Ngāti Rārua and protect their interests.
    
    (5) The Crown is sorry that its actions rendered Ngāti Rārua virtually landless in their rohe. This had a devastating impact on the social and cultural well-being of the people of Ngāti Rārua that continues to be seen today. The Crown also accepts that the loss of their land and their restriction to inadequate reserves has significantly marginalised Ngāti Rārua from the benefits of economic development, and limited the autonomy and ability of the iwi to exercise customary rights and responsibilities throughout the Ngāti Rārua rohe.
    
    (6) The Crown with this settlement acknowledges the rangatiratanga of Ngāti Rārua and seeks to restore the Crown's honour. The Crown hopes this apology and settlement will mark the beginning of a renewed and enduring relationship with Ngāti Rārua based on mutual trust, co-operation, and respect for Te Tiriti o Waitangi/the [Treaty of Waitangi][298] and its principles.

#### Historical account, acknowledgements, and apology for Ngāti Tama ki Te Tau Ihu

##### 14 Summary of historical account for Ngāti Tama ki Te Tau Ihu
    
*   The historical account set out in the deed of settlement for Ngāti Tama ki Te Tau Ihu (_Ngāti Tama_) is summarised as follows:
    
    (1) Ngāti Tama came to Te Tau Ihu o te Waka a Maui (the northern South Island) in the late 1820s and established pā and kainga at several localities in Te Tau Ihu including Te Tai Tapu, Golden Bay, and Wakapuaka.
    
    (2) In 1839 the New Zealand Company signed deeds with Māori that purported to purchase the entire northern South Island. No Ngāti Tama signed the Company's deeds. In 1842 the New Zealand Company established its Nelson settlement and distributed gifts to local Māori, including Ngāti Tama, as "a present upon settling on the land". Some Ngāti Tama from Wakapuaka who received gifts also objected to their land being sold by the 1839 deeds.
    
    (3) In 1844 a Crown-appointed Commissioner investigated the Company's purchases. He heard from only one Māori witness in Nelson before suspending the inquiry to enable the Company to negotiate a settlement. Māori, including Ngāti Tama, signed deeds of release in return for payments which the Commissioner described as gifts to assist settlement rather than payments for the land. Golden Bay Ngāti Tama were not present at the Commissioner's hearing or arbitration. Nonetheless a share of the money was set aside for them.
    
    (4) In 1845, on the Commissioner's recommendation, the Crown prepared a grant to the New Zealand Company of 151 000 acres of land in Tasman and Golden Bays which would have reserved 15 100 acres for Māori. However, the Company objected to several aspects of this grant. In 1848 the Company accepted a new Crown grant for a larger area of land in Te Tau Ihu that reserved only 5 053 acres of land at Nelson and Motueka, as well as areas in Golden Bay and Wairau.
    
    (5) Ngāti Tama had negligible involvement in the administration of the Nelson and Motueka reserves, known as the "Tenths". Most were leased to settlers to generate income that was spent on Māori purposes. In 1862 the Crown allocated parts of at least four Motueka Tenths sections for Ngāti Tama occupation. However, ownership of these lands was not separately granted to Ngāti Tama. From 1887 the Tenths were leased under perpetually renewable leases. Rentals were infrequently reviewed and over time inflation reduced the value of rental returns. During the twentieth century the Tenths reserves were reduced by the compulsory acquisition of uneconomic shares and the sale of reserves.
    
    (6) In 1853 the Crown granted land at Motueka to the Church of England to establish a school. The grant comprised 160 acres of Crown land and 918 acres of Tenths reserves. Ngāti Tama whanau had to move from the reserves when the school was established. The school was closed in 1881 but the land was not restored to Māori until 1993\. Ngāti Tama were not included in the trust established to administer the land.
    
    (7) In 1852 the Crown purchased the mineral-rich Pakawau block paying only for its agricultural value. In 1853 the Crown purported to purchase all remaining Māori land in Te Tau Ihu through the Waipounamu deed. Ngāti Tama as an iwi was not involved in the negotiation and protested the Crown's actions. The Crown did not meet with resident Māori to finalise the purchase until 1855 when Crown agents applied pressure on Ngāti Tama by presenting their land as already sold. Ngāti Tama and another iwi received £600 for their remaining interests in Te Waipounamu, although Ngāti Tama excluded Wakapuaka from the sale. Many of the reserves created for Ngāti Tama from the Waipounamu purchase were found over time to be inadequate for development in the new economy. Some reserves were quickly sold. In 1892 the Native Land Court awarded the remaining reserves to individual Ngāti Tama. Over time, ownership of the reserves became increasingly fragmented through successions to the interests of deceased owners.
    
    (8) In 1883 the Native Land Court awarded Wakapuaka to a sole Ngāti Tama individual. This disinherited other Ngāti Tama who had lived on Wakapuaka since the 1830s. Protests from Ngāti Tama eventually led the Crown to promote legislation authorising a reinvestigation of the remaining portions of Wakapuaka. In 1937 some Ngāti Tama were awarded interests, but not all Ngāti Tama whanau who had previously resided on Wakapuaka were admitted to the title.
    
    (9) By the end of the twentieth century the virtual landlessness of Ngāti Tama had contributed to some Ngāti Tama leaving Te Tau Ihu and losing their connection with their iwi and turangawaewae.

##### 15 Text of acknowledgements for Ngāti Tama ki Te Tau Ihu
    
*   The text of the acknowledgements set out in the deed of settlement for Ngāti Tama ki Te Tau Ihu (_Ngāti Tama_) is as follows:
    
    (1) The Crown acknowledges that it has failed to address the long-standing grievances of Ngāti Tama in an appropriate way and that recognition of these grievances is long overdue.
    
    (2) The Crown acknowledges that it failed to adequately inform itself of and protect the interests of Ngāti Tama, including their ongoing needs, during the process by which land was granted to the New Zealand Company in 1848\. The Crown acknowledges that this failure was a breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi][298] and its principles.
    
    (3) The Crown acknowledges that, in respect of the reserves that were formally established following the 1848 Crown grant of land to the New Zealand Company and which became known as the Nelson and Motueka "Tenths",---
        
    *   (a) it failed to adequately provide for Ngāti Tama to control those lands they occupied and used; and
    
    *   (b) it failed to ensure that the area ultimately reserved was sufficient for the ongoing use and benefit of Ngāti Tama.
    
    The Crown acknowledges that these failures were in breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi][298] and its principles and that as a consequence Ngāti Tama was unable to fully benefit from the developing economy of Nelson and the wider Te Tau Ihu region.
    
    (4) The Crown acknowledges that the grant of Tenths land at Whakarewa in 1853 meant that some Ngāti Tama whanau had to move from land they were occupying at the time. The Crown further acknowledges that despite protests from Māori beginning in 1881 the Whakarewa lands were not returned until 1993\.
    
    (5) The Crown acknowledges that in 1852 it sought to purchase the Pakawau block before Ngāti Tama and other Māori became aware of the full potential value of its minerals and that the price paid reflected the agricultural value of the land only.
    
    (6) The Crown acknowledges that it did not include Ngāti Tama in its negotiations in 1862 to regulate gold mining on the Te Tai Tapu block.
    
    (7) The Crown acknowledges that when it purchased most of the remaining Māori land in Te Tau Ihu between 1853 and 1856---
        
    *   (a) it did not negotiate with Ngāti Tama as an iwi prior to signing the 1853 Te Waipounamu deed and applied heavy pressure in its negotiations with resident Ngāti Tama in 1855, including presenting the land as already sold; and
    
    *   (b) it did not set aside adequate reserves for the present and future needs of Ngāti Tama in Te Tau Ihu.
    
    The Crown acknowledges that these failures meant that it failed to adequately protect the interests of Ngāti Tama when purchasing their land and this was in breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi][298] and its principles.
    
    (8) The Crown acknowledges that the operation and impact of the native land laws on the remaining lands of Ngāti Tama and, in particular, the awarding of land to individuals, rather than to Ngāti Tama as an iwi,---
        
    *   (a) made those lands more susceptible to partition, fragmentation, and alienation; and
    
    *   (b) further contributed to the erosion of the traditional social and cultural structures of Ngāti Tama.
    
    The Crown acknowledges that it failed to take adequate steps to protect the traditional social and cultural structures of Ngāti Tama and that this was a breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi][298] and its principles.
    
    (9) The Crown acknowledges that it first became aware of protest by Ngāti Tama over the Native Land Court's Wakapuaka decision in 1896, but that it did not take steps to effect a reinvestigation of the Wakapuaka case until 1936\. The Crown also acknowledges that the alienation of the Wakapuaka block has remained a significant grievance for Ngāti Tama down to the present day.
    
    (10) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) Ngāti Tama had negligible involvement in the administration of the Tenths reserves between 1842 and 1977:
    
    *   (b) on occasion, the Crown used Tenths funds as a partial replacement to government spending:
    
    *   (c) it was not until 1892, several decades after the establishment of the Tenths, that the beneficiaries of the Tenths fund were identified:
    
    *   (d) while the interests of Ngāti Tama in the Tenths reserves were recognised, beneficial interests in the Tenths fund were awarded to individuals, rather than to Ngāti Tama as an iwi.
    
    (11) The Crown acknowledges that certain actions and omissions with respect to the administration of the Nelson and Motueka Tenths reserves resulted in prejudice to those Ngāti Tama who held a beneficial interest in the Tenths reserves fund, including---
        
    *   (a) the imposition of a regime of perpetually renewable leases; and
    
    *   (b) permitting the Māori Trustee to sell "uneconomic interests" and Tenths land in the twentieth century.
    
    The Crown acknowledges that these actions and omissions were in breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi][298] and its principles.
    
    (12) The Crown acknowledges that the loss of lands and resources over time has damaged the mana, social structure, and well-being of Ngāti Tama as an iwi. The Crown also acknowledges that this contributed to some Ngāti Tama leaving Te Tau Ihu and losing their connection with Ngāti Tama and their turangawaewae.
    
    (13) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) the cumulative effect of the Crown's actions and omissions has left Ngāti Tama virtually landless; and
    
    *   (b) the Crown's failure to ensure that Ngāti Tama retained sufficient land for its present and future needs was a breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi][298] and its principles.
    
    (14) The Crown further acknowledges that the cumulative effect of these actions and omissions has---
        
    *   (a) hindered Ngāti Tama's economic, social, and cultural development; and
    
    *   (b) undermined Ngāti Tama's relationship with the Crown.
    
    

##### 16 Text of apology for Ngāti Tama ki Te Tau Ihu
    
*   The text of the apology set out in the deed of settlement for Ngāti Tama ki Te Tau Ihu (_Ngāti Tama_) is as follows:
    
    (1) The Crown makes the following apology to Ngāti Tama and to their ancestors and descendants.
    
    (2) The Crown profoundly regrets and unreservedly apologises for breaching its obligations to Ngāti Tama under the [Treaty of Waitangi][298].
    
    (3) The Crown profoundly regrets and apologises for its cumulative acts and omissions which left Ngāti Tama virtually landless in Te Tau Ihu. The Crown deeply regrets and sincerely apologises that it did not adequately protect the interests of Ngāti Tama and appropriately respect Ngāti Tama rangatiratanga when purchasing their land.
    
    (4) The Crown is deeply remorseful for the significant damage that the alienation of Ngāti Tama from their whenua and customary resources in Golden and Tasman Bays has caused over many generations to the traditional social and cultural structures, mana, and well-being of Ngāti Tama.
    
    (5) The Crown is sincerely sorry that its actions and omissions have detrimentally affected the ability of Ngāti Tama to exercise customary rights and responsibilities within their rohe and contributed to their economic and social marginalisation in Te Tau Ihu.
    
    (6) With this apology the Crown seeks to atone for its past wrongs, restore its honour, which has been damaged by its actions, and begin the process of healing. With this settlement the Crown looks forward to beginning a renewed and enduring relationship with Ngāti Tama based on good faith, mutual trust and co-operation, and respect for the [Treaty of Waitangi][298] and its principles.

#### Historical account, acknowledgements, and apology for Te Ātiawa o Te Waka-a-Māui

##### 17 Summary of historical account for Te Ātiawa o Te Waka-a-Māui
    
*   The historical account set out in the deed of settlement for Te Ātiawa o Te Waka-a-Māui (_Te Ātiawa_) is summarised as follows:
    
    (1) Te Ātiawa came to Te Tau Ihu (the northern South Island) in the late 1820s. Te Ātiawa established pā and kainga at Queen Charlotte Sound (Totaranui), Tasman Bay, Golden Bay, and Te Tai Tapu.
    
    (2) In 1839 the New Zealand Company signed deeds with Māori that purported to purchase the entire northern South Island. In 1840 over twenty Te Ātiawa signed the [Treaty of Waitangi][298] at Totaranui.
    
    (3) In 1842 the Company presented gifts to local Māori, including Te Ātiawa, upon establishing its Nelson settlement. Te Ātiawa also contested the meaning of the Company's 1839 transactions. In 1844 a Crown-appointed commissioner investigated the Company's purchases. He heard from one Māori witness in Nelson before suspending the inquiry to enable the Company to negotiate a settlement. Māori signed deeds of release in return for accepting payments described by the commissioner as gifts to assist settlement rather than payments for the land. Some Te Ātiawa from Golden Bay were not present at the commissioner's hearing.
    
    (4) In 1845, on the commissioner's recommendation, the Crown prepared a grant to the New Zealand Company of 151 000 acres in Tasman and Golden Bays, which would have reserved 15 100 acres for Māori. However, the Company objected to several aspects of this grant. In 1848 the Company accepted a new Crown grant for a larger area of land that reserved only 5 053 acres at Nelson and Motueka, and areas in the Wairau and Golden Bay.
    
    (5) Te Ātiawa had negligible involvement in the administration of the Nelson and Motueka reserves, known as "Tenths", which were leased to settlers to generate income that was spent on Māori purposes. In the 1850s and 1860s the Crown allocated a number of Motueka Tenths sections to Te Ātiawa for their occupation. However, ownership of these lands was not granted separately to Te Ātiawa. From 1887 the Tenths were leased under perpetually renewable leases. Rentals were infrequently reviewed and over time inflation reduced rental returns. During the twentieth century the Tenths were reduced by the compulsory acquisition of uneconomic shares and the sale of reserves.
    
    (6) Between 1848 and 1850 the Crown assisted the New Zealand Company to purchase Waitohi (now known as Picton), the principal settlement of Te Ātiawa in Totaranui. As part of the sale Te Ātiawa relocated to a reserve at Waikawa that had less suitable soil for cultivation than Waitohi.
    
    (7) In 1852, the Crown purchased the mineral-rich Pakawau block. The Crown only paid for the agricultural value of Pakawau. In 1853, the Crown signed the Waipounamu deed with other iwi, and purported to have purchased most of the remaining Māori land in Te Tau Ihu. Te Ātiawa did not sign the deed, but were to receive a share of the purchase money. The Crown used the 1853 deed to pressure resident Te Ātiawa to agree to the sale and the alienation of their land. Resident Te Ātiawa received £613 for the Waipounamu purchase compared with £900 paid to non-resident Te Ātiawa. The reserves created for Te Ātiawa were generally inadequate for customary use or agricultural or pastoral farming. Over time most Te Ātiawa reserves in Totaranui and Golden Bay were alienated, including several hundred acres taken by the Crown for public works and scenery preservation purposes.
    
    (8) By the late nineteenth century, Te Ātiawa were virtually landless. At this time the Crown allocated landless Te Ātiawa individuals land on Stewart Island and on the West Coast, but never granted them title to the land.
    
    (9) The loss of land and poor quality reserves have contributed to socio-economic hardship for Te Ātiawa. Crown policies of assimilation and integration as well as urbanisation exacerbated cultural dislocation. Te Ātiawa have lost connection with many significant sites and resources, which has had a detrimental effect on their spiritual, economic, and cultural well-being.

##### 18 Text of acknowledgements for Te Ātiawa o Te Waka-a-Māui
    
*   The text of the acknowledgements set out in the deed of settlement for Te Ātiawa o Te Waka-a-Māui (_Te Ātiawa_) is as follows:
    
    (1) The Crown acknowledges that it has failed to deal with the long-standing grievances of Te Ātiawa in an appropriate way and that recognition of these grievances is long overdue.
    
    (2) The Crown acknowledges that it failed to adequately inform itself of and protect the interests, including the ongoing needs, of Te Ātiawa during the process by which land was granted to the New Zealand Company in 1848, and this failure was a breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi][298] and its principles.
    
    (3) The Crown acknowledges that Waitohi, at the head of Totaranui (Queen Charlotte Sound), was Te Ātiawa's principal settlement on the mainland, and that---
        
    *   (a) the Crown's promise to survey a town at Waikawa was the main incentive for Te Ātiawa to finally agree to sell Waitohi and move to Waikawa:
    
    *   (b) the Crown did not precisely define the boundaries of the land to be purchased in the preliminary 1848 agreement and did not show the boundaries of the purchase on a map until a deed was signed in 1850:
    
    *   (c) the land set aside for Te Ātiawa at Waikawa was less suitable for their cultivations than the land they gave up at Waitohi:
    
    *   (d) the Crown did not fulfil its promise in the 1850 deed to build a chapel for Te Ātiawa at Waikawa until 1860\.
    
    The Crown acknowledges the sense of grievance felt by Te Ātiawa at having to relocate from Waitohi to Waikawa and that this grievance exists to the present day.
    
    (4) The Crown acknowledges that it sought to purchase the Pakawau block before Te Ātiawa and other Māori became aware of the potential value of its minerals, and the price paid reflected the agricultural value of the land only.
    
    (5) The Crown acknowledges that when it purchased most of the remaining Māori land in Te Tau Ihu between 1847 and 1856:---
        
    *   (a) it did not negotiate with Te Ātiawa in Te Tau Ihu prior to signing the 1853 Te Waipounamu deed and applied heavy pressure in its negotiations with resident Te Ātiawa in 1856 to agree to the Waipounamu purchase; and
    
    *   (b) it did not set aside adequate reserves for the present and future needs of Te Ātiawa in Te Tau Ihu.
    
    The Crown acknowledges that it failed to adequately protect the interests of Te Ātiawa when purchasing their land and that this was a breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi][298] and its principles.
    
    (6) The Crown acknowledges that it did not include Te Ātiawa in its negotiations in 1862 to regulate gold mining on the Taitapu block.
    
    (7) The Crown acknowledges that in the reserves that became known as the Nelson and Motueka "tenths" it failed to adequately provide for Te Ātiawa to control those lands they occupied and used, and failed to ensure that the area ultimately reserved was sufficient for the ongoing use and benefit of Te Ātiawa. The Crown acknowledges that these failures were in breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi][298] and its principles.
    
    (8) The Crown acknowledges that the grant of tenths land at Whakarewa in 1853 meant that some Te Ātiawa whanau had to move from land they were occupying at the time. The Crown further acknowledges that despite protests from Māori beginning in 1881 the Whakarewa lands were not returned until 1993\.
    
    (9) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) Te Ātiawa had negligible involvement in the administration of the tenths reserves between 1842 and 1977; and
    
    *   (b) it was not until 1892, several decades after the establishment of the tenths, that the beneficiaries of the tenths fund were identified.
    
    (10) The Crown acknowledges that certain actions and omissions with respect to the administration of the Nelson and Motueka tenths reserves, including the imposition of a regime of perpetually renewable leases, and permitting the Māori Trustee to sell "uneconomic interests" and tenths land in the twentieth century, resulted in prejudice to those Te Ātiawa who held a beneficial interest in the tenths reserves fund and were in breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi][298] and its principles.
    
    (11) The Crown acknowledges that the operation and impact of the native land laws on the reserves granted to Te Ātiawa, in particular the awarding of land to individual Te Ātiawa rather than to iwi or hapū, made those lands more susceptible to partition, fragmentation, and alienation. This further contributed to the erosion of the traditional tribal structures of Te Ātiawa. The Crown failed to take adequate steps to protect those structures and this was a breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi][298] and its principles.
    
    (12) The Crown acknowledges that most of the reserves set aside for Te Ātiawa from the Waitohi and Te Waipounamu purchases have over time been alienated from Te Ātiawa ownership, including through Crown takings from their Waikawa reserve for public works, and from their Queen Charlotte Sound reserves for scenery preservation purposes.
    
    (13) The Crown acknowledges that members of Te Ātiawa were never issued title to land allocated to them on Stewart Island and at Whakapoai under the ""landless natives"" scheme. The Crown's failure to implement the scheme effectively meant that it did nothing to alleviate the landless position of those Te Ātiawa in Te Tau Ihu and this was a breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi][298] and its principles.
    
    (14) The Crown acknowledges that the cumulative effect of Crown actions and omissions left Te Ātiawa virtually landless. The Crown's failure to ensure that Te Ātiawa retained sufficient land for their present and future needs was a breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi][298] and its principles.
    
    (15) The Crown acknowledges that environmental modification and degradation, particularly in the Marlborough Sounds, has had a detrimental impact on sites of cultural and spiritual significance to Te Ātiawa and limited the ability of Te Ātiawa to access some of their traditional land and sea resources.

##### 19 Text of apology for Te Ātiawa o Te Waka-a-Māui
    
*   The text of the apology set out in the deed of settlement for Te Ātiawa o Te Waka-a-Māui (_Te Ātiawa_) is as follows:
    
    (1) The Crown makes the following apology to Te Ātiawa, and to their ancestors and descendants.
    
    (2) The Crown is deeply sorry that it has failed to live up to the obligations it accepted when more than twenty Te Ātiawa rangatira signed the [Treaty of Waitangi][298] at Totaranui (Queen Charlotte Sound) in May 1840\.
    
    (3) The Crown profoundly regrets and apologises for its actions, which left Te Ātiawa virtually landless in Te Tau Ihu. The Crown recognises that by 1860 Crown land purchases in Te Tau Ihu had largely restricted Te Ātiawa to isolated reserves and marginalised the iwi from the new emerging economy. In particular the Crown regrets that when it arranged the purchase of Waitohi as the site of a town for settlers, this meant Te Ātiawa had to forsake their principal settlement in Totaranui.
    
    (4) The Crown acknowledges that it has failed to appropriately respect Te Ātiawa rangatiratanga. It is greatly remorseful that, over the generations to the present day, Crown actions have undermined your social and traditional structures, and your autonomy and ability to exercise your customary rights and responsibilities.
    
    (5) The Crown unreservedly apologises to Te Ātiawa for failing to honour its obligations under the [Treaty of Waitangi][298]. Through this apology the Crown seeks to atone for these wrongs and hopes that this settlement will mark the beginning of a new relationship with Te Ātiawa based on the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles.

    (2) However, although the licensed property does not cease to be Crown forest land until the transfer to the relevant trustees is registered, neither the Crown nor any court or tribunal may do any thing or omit to do any thing if that act or omission would, between the settlement date and the date of registration,---
        
    *   (a) be permitted by the [Crown Forest Assets Act 1989][430]; but
    
    *   (b) be inconsistent with part 6 of a deed of settlement.
    
    

##### 173 Trustees confirmed beneficiaries and licensors in relation to licensed property
    
*   (1) The relevant trustees are, in relation to a licensed property, the confirmed beneficiaries under clause 11.1 of the Crown forestry rental trust deed.
    
    (2) The effect of subsection (1) is that---
        
    *   (a) the relevant trustees are entitled to the rental proceeds paid for the property to the trustees of the Crown forestry rental trust under the relevant Crown forestry licence since the commencement of the licence; and
    
    *   (b) all the provisions of the Crown forestry rental trust deed apply on the basis that the relevant trustees are the confirmed beneficiaries in relation to the property.
    
    (3) Despite subsection (2)(a), the trustees of the settlement trusts and the trustee of the Toa Rangatira Trust are entitled to the rental proceeds referred to in subsection (2)(a) for all of the licensed properties as provided for in---
        
    *   (a) clause 6.9 of the deeds of settlement for Ngāti Kōata and Ngāti Rārua:

    *   (d) clause 6.22 of the deed of settlement for Ngati Toa Rangatira.
    
    (4) The Crown must give notice in accordance with [section 17(4)(b)][431] of the Crown Forest Assets Act 1989 in respect of each relevant Crown forestry licence, even though the Waitangi Tribunal has not made recommendations under [section 8HB(1)(a)][432] of the Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975 for the return of the 1 or more licensed properties to which the licence applies.
    
    (5) Notice given by the Crown under subsection (4) has effect as if---
        
    *   (a) the Waitangi Tribunal had made recommendations under [section 8HB(1)(a)][432] of the Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975 for the return of each licensed property; and
    
    *   (b) the recommendations had become final on the settlement date.
    
    (6) The relevant trustees are the licensors under the relevant Crown forestry licence in relation to a licensed property as if the property had been returned to Māori ownership---
        
    *   (a) on the settlement date; and
    
    *   (b) under [section 36][433] of the Crown Forest Assets Act 1989\.
    
    (7) However, [section 36(1)(b)][433] of the Crown Forest Assets Act 1989 does not apply to a licensed property.

##### 174 Effect of transfer of licensed property
    
*   (1) [Section 173][216] applies whether or not---
        
    *   (a) the transfer of the fee simple estate in the 1 or more licensed properties to which the relevant Crown forestry licence applies has been registered; or
    
    *   (b) the processes described in clause 17.4 of the relevant Crown forestry licence have been completed.
    
    (2) To the extent that the Crown has not completed the processes referred to in subsection (1)(b) before the settlement date, it must continue those processes---
        
    *   (a) on or after the settlement date; and
    
    *   (b) until the processes are completed.
    
    (3) Subsection (4) provides for the licence fee payable for a property under the relevant Crown forestry licence---
        
    *   (a) for the period starting on the settlement date until the completion of the processes referred to in subsections (1) and (2) for the 1 or more licensed properties to which the licence applies; and
    
    *   (b) that is not part of the rental proceeds referred to in [section 173(2)(a)][216].
    
    (4) The licence fee payable is the amount calculated in the manner described in---
        
    *   (a) paragraphs 6.24 and 6.25 of the property redress schedule of the deed of settlement for Ngāti Kōata:
    
    *   (b) paragraphs 6.26 and 6.27 of the property redress schedule of the deed of settlement for Ngāti Rārua and Ngāti Tama ki Te Tau Ihu:
    
    *   (c) paragraphs 6.27 and 6.28 of the property redress schedule of the deed of settlement for Te Ātiawa o Te Waka-a-Māui.
    
    (5) However, the calculation under subsection (4) of the licence fee payable is overridden by any agreement between the licensors and the licensee of the relevant Crown forestry licence.
    
    (6) With effect on and from the settlement date, references to the prospective proprietors in clause 17.4 of the relevant Crown forestry licence must, in relation to a licensed property, be read as if they were references to the relevant trustees.
    
    (7) Subsections (8) and (9) apply if, in completing the processes described in clause 17.4 of the relevant Crown forestry licence for a licensed property, the balance of the land referred to in clause 17.4.1 of the licence is to be transferred as another licensed property under the deed of settlement for Ngāti Rārua, Ngāti Tama ki Te Tau Ihu, Te Ātiawa o Te Waka-a-Māui, or Ngati Toa Rangatira (instead of being retained by the Crown).
    
    (8) The interests of the trustees to whom the balance is to be transferred replace the interests of the Crown in respect of the balance of the land in clause 17.4.1 of the relevant Crown forestry licence, and those trustees must be treated as if they were another set of prospective proprietors under clause 17.4 of the licence.
    
    (9) The separate licence for the balance of the land referred to in clause 17.4.3 of the relevant Crown forestry licence must include clauses similar to clauses 16.3 to 16.9 of the licence, as described in clause 17.4.4\.

##### 176 Management of marginal strips
    
*   (1) Any lessee of the unlicensed land under registered lease 9269596.1 is to be treated as if it had been appointed, under [section 24H(1)][434] of the Conservation Act 1987, to be the manager of any marginal strip within the unlicensed land.
    
    (2) The lessee may do 1 or more of the following things in relation to the marginal strip:

##### 225 No compensation for technical redundancy
    
*   A transferred employee is not entitled to receive any payment or any other benefit solely on the ground that---

    (3) If income of the charitable trust board is derived from a financial arrangement, trading stock, revenue account property, or depreciable property and is exempt income of the charitable trust board but is not exempt income of the NTTW trustees, the NTTW trustees are to be treated as having acquired the financial arrangement, trading stock, revenue account property, or depreciable property---

    (6) If the NTTW trustees distribute any of the undistributed charitable amount to a person, that amount is treated as beneficiary income for the purposes of the [Income Tax Act 2007][468], unless subsection (7) applies.
    
    (7) If the NTTW trustees distribute any of the undistributed charitable amount for a charitable purpose, the distribution is exempt income of the recipient.
