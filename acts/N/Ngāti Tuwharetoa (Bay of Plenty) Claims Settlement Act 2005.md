    (1) Kua whakatakotoria te Tiriti o Waitangi, tauira reo Māori, tauira reo Pākehā hoki, i roto i te Wāhanga Tuatahi o te Ture Tiriti o Waitangi 1975\. I hainatia te Tiriti nei i te tau 1840:
    
    (2) Mā ngā whiti (3) ki (44) o tēnei Kupu Whakataki ka kitea he whakarāpopototanga o ngā kōrero o muri i te kerēme o neherā o Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) kua whakatakotoria ki roto i te whakaaetanga whakataunga i whakamanahia i waenga i a Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) rāua ko te Karauna:
    
    ###### Tāhuhu kōrero
    
    (3) Ko tā tēnei wāhanga, he whakatakoto i te tāhū kōrero e whakakaupapa mai ana i ngā manakohanga me te whakapāha a te Karauna:
    
    ###### Te rohe o Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty)
    
    Ko Pūtauaki te Maunga, Ko Te Takanga i ō Apa te Awa, Ko Te Aotahi te Tangata, Ko Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) te Iwi:
    
    (4) E kī ana a Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty), ko tōna rohe mai Ōtamarākau ka whai i te awa o Waitahanui ki Ōtari ki Motuotara ki Maungawhakamana ki Ngārararua takiwā ki Haehaenga ki Kākahuoteritenga ki Waikareao ki Maraetahia ki Monehu ki Ōkorotere ki Panepane ki Pūtauaki ki Tāhuna ki Rākeihopukia ki Wahieroa ki Rurima ki Ōtamarākau. Ko te rohe o Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) kua huaina i runga ake nei, kei kō atu o te rārangi raupatu. Ko te Rangitaiki rāua ko Tarawera ngā awa nui o roto i te rohe. Tāpae atu ki ngā tohu whenua nei, ko ngā pūkorero nui a te iwi:
    
    (5) I runga i tōna tūranga hei tangata whenua o te rohe nei, ko ētahi o ngā wāhi nui kei roto i ngā kōrero a te iwi o Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty), ko Ōtamarākau, ko Ōtari, ko Motuotara, ko Maungawhakamana, ko Ngārararua, ko Haehaenga, ko Kākahuoteritenga, ko Waikareao, ko Maraetahia, ko Te Monehu, ko Ōkorotere, ko Panepane, ko Pūtauaki, ko Tāhuna, ko Rākeihopukia, ko Wahieroa, ko Ngā Moutere o Rurima, ko Ōtaramuturangi, ko Pāniwhaniwha (Ngāpariwhakairo), ko Mangāti, ko Tūwatawata, ko Te Waikoukou, ko Moturoa, Puketapu, ko Ōtukoiro, ko Te Kiore Pohoroa, ko Korotiwha, ko Otitapu, ko Paokoroiti, ko Te Pātaua, ko Te Pakipaki, ko Tainapekapeka, ko Taumanawa, ko Tūmanuka, ko Peketā, ko Te Waha-o-te-Parata, ko Ōpeke, ko Tāhunaroa, ko Tahutu, ko Whakarewa, ko Ōniao, ko Umuhika, ko Hāhūru, ko Ōkōtuku, ko Ōwhirirangi, ko Whātangi, ko Koroaha, ko Tutarautawhai, ko Parangaehe, ko Mangapehi, ko Ōterangikahamai, ko Poutakamoko, ko Pukehīnau, ko Pokanui, ko Ōteao, ko Te Ahi-inanga, ko Te Atua Reretahi, ko Te Kopua, ko Huratoki, ko Te Haehaenga, ko Ōtangihia, ko Pōkohu, ko Ōtangiwaka, ko Taranaki, ko Mātirawhāiti, ko Whakapaukōrero, ko Whakapaukarakia, ko Mōkaingārara, ko Ōhinetewai, ko Tūhaepō, ko Te Kōhika, ko Te Ahikōkōwai, ko Kākaramea, ko Whakahoro, ko Mangawhio, ko Ruataniwha. Ko ētahi o ngā awaawa ko: Waitahanui, ko Hauone, ko Herepuru, ko Pikowai, ko Mimiha/Whakarewa, ko Ōhinekoao, ko Waihoko, ko Kohi-o-Awa, ko Wai-te-Ariki, ko Wai-te-puru, ko Awakaponga, ko Whāriki-te-toki, ko Waikamihi, ko Wairere-a-tu (te ingoa mohiotia ai e Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) a Braemar Springs), ko Pōkerekere, ko Te Kaokaoroa:
    
    (6) I kī a Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) i mua o te tau 1866 ko ā ratou mahi i aua wā ko te whakatipu māra kūmara, rīwai, wīti, harakeke hoki hei hoko ki ngā kaihokohoko Pākehā, ko te hari hoki i aua taonga ki ngā mākete. Ko Ōkākāru (wāhi ngāwhā) i te takiwā o Kawerau tētahi wāhi motuhake mō te whakaora me te whakamāui, me te whakatō moata o ngā tipu pēnei i te kūmara. I rongonui te wāhi nei mō te mahi a te tuna, a te ika, hei wāhi hoki mō te whāngai tuna, me kī, i ngā wāhi e mahana ana i te waiariki. Ko te haere mā runga waka ka mutu, nui ana te kai i ngā repo:
    
    ###### Ngā whakamārama mō te Raupatu---Te Riri i te Waiariki ki te Rāwhiti
    
    (7) Nō te marama o Hūrae o te tau 1863 pakaru mai ai te riri ki waenganui i te Karauna me ngā Māori i Waikato; hei wāhanga o te riri nei, i pakaru ētahi whawhai ki te Waiariki i te haurua tōmua o te tau 1864:
    
    (8) Nō te marama o Hūrae o te tau 1865, whai muri o tētahi wā whakariuka, ka patua a James Fulloon, tētahi āpiha nā te Karauna, me ētahi heremana tokotoru o runga i te kaipuke _Kate_, e ētahi Māori i Whakatāne. Nā T H Smith, te Komihana Karauna i Maketū te whakamana kia hopukina te hunga i whai wāhi ki ngā mahi kōhuru i te hunga i runga i te kaipuke _Kate_:
    
    (9) Nō te marama o Ākuhata o te tau 1865 takatū ai tētahi ope taua a te Karauna e 500 ngā hōia, tae noa ki ētahi Māori mai i ngā hapū me ngā iwi e noho tata ana, kei raro i ngā whakahau a Meiha William Mair, Kaiwhakawā ā-Rohe, ki te mauhere i ērā i ingoatia i te whakamana. Ka whāia ērā i ingoatia i te whakamana, ka awhitia ētahi pā i te Waiariki ki te rāwhiti. Ko ētahi o Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) e noho ana ki aua pā:
    
    (10) Nō te hipanga o te ope taua i te pā o Pārawai ka pakaru mai te whawhai. Ka murua e ngā hōia o te Karauna ngā kararehe me ngā pātaka kai engari kore rawa te pā i horo. Kātahi ka neke ngā hōia ki Te Umuhika, i reira tū ano te puehu i waenganui i ngā hōia me ētahi tāngata mai i te pā o Pārawai. I te pakanga nei, ka mate a Hoete o te hapū o Te Tāwera, i a ia e aukati ana i ngā hōia e whakaeke ana i te pā. E toru tāima a ia e pūhia ana. Ko te whakapae i whiua ki runga i atahi o Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty), nā rātou ētahi o ngā ""tāngata hara"" i atawhai. Ka whakamatea ēnei e te ope taua a te Karauna, kātahi ia ka neke ki Te Kupenga. E ai ki a Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) ko ētahi o ngā tāngata i whakamatea, kāore i te paku aha, i te manaaki noa iho i ērā i te whāia e te Karauna:
    
    (11) Nō te 2 o Hepetema o te tau 1865 whakaputaina ai e te Karauna tētahi Pānui Rongomau e kī ana kua mutu te pakanga. I kī te Pānui, kāore e hāmenetia ērā i tū mārō ki te Karauna mai i te tau 1863, mō ā rātou hara o mua. Kāore i whakaurua ki te Pānui Rongomau te hunga nā rātou a Fulloon me ētahi atu i kōhuru. I kī anō te Pānui, ki te kore e hoatuna ki te Karauna te hunga nā rātou a Fulloon mā i kōhuru, ""ka raupatutia e te Karauna tētahi wāhanga o ngā whenua o ngā iwi kei te huna i ngā kaikohuru nei"":
    
    (12) Nō te 4 o te marama o Hepetema o te tau 1865 whakaputaina ai e te Kawana tētahi Pānui Ture Taua ki ngā rohe o Whakatāne me Ōpotiki, e tareka ai te hopu i te hunga nā rātou a Fulloon mā i kōhuru. Noho ai ngā hōia a te Karauna ki waho o ētahi pā, ki te whai i te hunga tērā i roto rātou i ngā mahi kōhuru:
    
    (13) I te marama o Oketopa o te tau 1865, ka mahue te pā o Pārawai e ngā tāngata i roto, ka haere ki te pā o Te Kupenga, ki reira hono atu ai ki ētahi atu o ngā iwi o te Waiariki, tae rawa ki ētahi o te hunga i ingoatia he tangata hara. Ka whakaekea a Te Kupenga e te Karauna. Nō te 20 o Oketopa o te tau 1865 taka ai te toenga o ngā tāngata i te pā o Te Kupenga ki raro i te mana o te Karauna:
    
    ###### Te Raupatu i raro i Te Ture Whakatau Manene ki Niu Tireni 1863
    
    (14) Nō te 17 o Hānuere o te tau 1866, nā tētahi Whakahau Kaunihera, i raupatutia e te Karauna ētahi 448 000 eka i te Waiariki ki te rāwhiti, i raro i Te Ture Whakatau Manene ki Niu Tireni 1863\. I whakahouhia te raina raupatu i raro i tētahi pānui Karauna i te 1 o Hepetema o te tau 1866\. I uru atu ki ngā whenua raupatu nei ko te 87 000 eka o Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty):
    
    (15) E ai ki ngā korero a te ture, ko ētahi take i whakaturia ai Te Ture Whakatau Manene ki Niu Tireni 1863, ko te whakaū i te rongomau me te maru, me te whakatu me te pupuri i te mana o te Kuini. E ai ki tā te Ture nei, ko te whakakuhu mai i ētahi tāngata whai te ""huarahi pai, tōtika rawa"" e tūtuki ai aua kaupapa:
    
    (16) Kāore te Ture i kōrero mō te whakawhiu, engari koia tērā tōna whāinga. I whakamahia te Ture ki te raupatu i ngā whenua Māori inā tau ana te Kāwana kei te ""hara tētahi iwi, tētahi wāhanga rānei o tētahi iwi, ētahi tāngata tokomaha rēnei mai i tētahi iwi"" ki te mana o te Kuini mai i te 1 o te marama o Hanuere o te tau 1863\. Ka āhei te Kāwana ki te whakatau i tētahi Rohe i raro i te Ture, i runga i te mea he whenua kei taua rohe nō ētahi tāngata e kīia nei he tangata hara rātou:
    
    (17) I whakatau te Karauna, he iwi hara ngā iwi o te Waiariki i te mea i ""ātete"" rātou ki ngā hōia i haere ki te rohe ki te mauhere i te hunga nā rātou a Fulloon mā i kōhuru:
    
    ###### Te Tikanga Pāremata
    
    (18) I whakatūria Te Kōti Pāremata i raro i ngā tikanga o Te Ture Whakatau Manene ki Niu Tireni 1863, ki te whakarongo ki ngā kerēme mō te whakahoki i ngā whenua raupatu. I mua o te wā noho o te Kōti Pāremata, i te marama o Pepuere o te tau 1866, tohungia ai ko Āpiha Karauna John A Wilson hei komihana motuhake, ki te whakarongo ki ngā wāwāhitanga o ngā whenua raupatu i Te Waiariki:
    
    (19) I whakaritea e Wilson kia wehea ki ētahi poraka ngā whenua e 87 000 eka i raupatutia, mai i te raina raupatu ki te uru, ahu atu ki te awa o Tarawera. He rahi tonu te wāhanga o te whenua nei, e kerēmehia ana e Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) me ētahi atu iwi, i tukuna kē ki ētahi iwi mai i Te Arawa me ētahi atu hei utu mō ngā mahi hōia. I riro atu anō ngā whenua, he pānga nō Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) i te taha rāwhiti o te awa o Tarawera:
    
    (20) I rongo Te Kōti Pāremata i ētahi korero mai i ētahi tāngata o Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) e pā ana ki ngā whenua kei roto i te raupatu, kei te taha hauāuru o te awa o Tarawera. Ko ētahi o ngā kerēme a Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) e whakaaehia ana e te Koti, mō ngā poraka whenua o Tawhitinui (e 6 320 eka) rāua ko Rotoitipaku (e 13 675 eka):
    
    (21) Nō te marama o Tīhema o te tau 1867 whakawhiwhia ai e Te Kōti Pāremata te poraka o Rotoitipaku ki ētahi tāngata tekau ā, ko te poraka o Tawhitinui i whakawhiwhia ki ētahi tāngata tekau mā tōru. I whakawhiwhia ēnei tāngata i te mea ko rātou te hunga whai pānga ki aua whenua ā, kāore rātou i kuhu ki ngā mahi ""hara"":
    
    (22) Ko te titiro a Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) ki ēnei whakawhiwhinga, mō te iwi kē ā, ko ngā tāngata i tohungia, i te tū kē hei kaitiaki mō te hapū. Hāunga, nō te pānuitanga o ngā whakawhiwhinga a Te Kōti Pāremata i roto i Te Kāhiti o Niu Tireni i te tau 1874, kāore he kōrero mō te kaitiaki, engari he kōrero kē mō te whakawhiwhi noa ki te hunga nei:
    
    (23) I whakawhiwhia ētahi o ngā tāngata o te hapū o Te Tāwera ki ētahi whenua i te takiwā o Umuhika, i runga tonu i ngā whakaritenga a Wilson; hei tāna, he rahi tonu ngā whenua o Te Tāwera i taua takiwā i mua o te pakaru mai o te riri:
    
    (24) Nō te marama o Tīhema o te tau 1867, whakawhiwhia ai e Te Kōti Pāremata ētahi pito whenua e 50 eka te rahi mai i ngā poraka whenua o Rotoitipaku me Tawhitinui ki ētahi tāngata tekau. Katoa ēnei whakawhiwhinga i raro i ngā tekiona 4 me te 6 o Te Ture Whenua Raupatu 1867, e āhei ana te Karauna ki te whakahoki whenua ki ētahi tāngata e whakaaro ana te Karauna kua ""tāngata hara kua tūohu ki te Karauna"":
    
    (25) I mahia e Wilson āna mahi i raro i ngā tekiona o Te Ture Whakatau Manene ki Niu Tireni 1863, me āna whakarereketanga. Nō muri kē ka whakatakoto ture hōu te Karauna, pēnei i Te Ture Whenua Raupatu 1867 e aha ai, e mana ā-ture ai ngā whakaritenga a Wilson:
    
    (26) Ahakoa te mea i whakawhiwhia a Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) ki ētahi whenua mā te huarahi o te tikanga pāremata, i ngaro ā rātou tika ki te kuhu ki ērā o ō rātou whenua me ā ratou rawa:
    
    (27) Ko ngā whenua i hoki mai mā te tikanga pāremata, i hoki mai ke ki ngā tangata takitahi, āpā te hapū, te iwi rānei. Kāore i hāngai ngā momo whakawhiwhinga nei ki ngā tikanga tiaki whenua o mua, nā reira i mōrearea te noho o aua whenua kei wehea:
    
    ###### Ngā Hoko a te Karauna
    
    (28) Nō te tau 1873, tīmata ai ngā āpiha hoko whenua a te Karauna ki te whakarite mō te rīhi i ngā poraka whenua o Rotoitipaku me Tawhitinui. Tokowaru ngā tāngata o Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) i haina i tētahi whakaaetanga rīhi mō ngā poraka. Ko ētahi o ngā tāngata nei i ingoatia hei kaitiaki mō ngā poraka e rua i roto i ngā whakamārama a Wilson i te wā o ngā whiwhi pāremata:
    
    (29) Nō te tau 1874, whai muri i te pānuitanga o ngā whakawhiwhinga mō ngā poraka o Rotoitipaku me Tawhitinui i roto i _Te Kāhiti o Niu Tireni_, i mārama te kitea atu, i te hē kē ngā ingoa i runga i ngā whakaaetanga rīhi. I ngana ngā āpiha hoko whenua a te Karauna ki te tutuki i te whakaaetanga rīhi mā te tiki i ngā hainatanga mai i te hunga katoa i roto i te rārangi i te pānui kāhiti. Uaua te mahi nei, i te taha whakahaere me te mea i te ngaro ētahi o te hunga i rārangitia i te kāhiti. Nō muri ka whakatau te Karauna kia hokona kē aua poraka:
    
    (30) Nō te tau 1878 āta wehea ai ētahi wāhi i roto i ngā poraka whenua o Rotoitipaku me Tawhitinui ā, i te nuinga o te wā, i ruritia ēnei whenua hei whenua rāhui, i raro tonu i ngā whakahau a ngā āpiha a te Karauna. I te tau o muri mai, i te wā o ngā whakaritenga me ētahi o te hunga i te rārangi kāhiti, i whakaae ngā āpiha hoko whenua a te Karauna kia kaua e uru aua whenua i rāhuitia ki ngā hokohoko:
    
    (31) I roto i ngā tau ka whai, ka whakarite te Karauna me ētahi o te hunga nō rātou ngā whenua kia hokona te katoa o te poraka o Tawhitinui; nō te tau 1883 i tutuki tērā. I wehea mai tētahi whenua rāhui e 88 eka te korahi i ngā mahi hokohoko:
    
    (32) I whakarite anō ngā āpiha a te Karauna kia hokona ngā pānga o ētahi tokorima o te hunga i whakawhiwhia ki te poraka o Rotoitipaku. I tuhi reta ki te Minita mō ngā Take Māori ētahi atu o te hunga i whakawhiwhia, i runga i tā rātou whakahē ki te hoko o te whenua. Ka tono te Karauna ki Te Kōti Whenua Māori kia pānuitia ōna pānga i roto i te poraka. I te wā e noho ana Te Kōti Whenua Māori, ka whakahē ētahi o te hunga kāore i hiahia ki te hoko i te whenua, kia whakaae rā anō ngā tāngata tekau katoa i whakawhiwhia ki te poraka, tae rawa ki ō rātou hapū. Ahakoa ō rātou whakahē, nō te 25 o Hūne o te tau 1883 whakawhiwhia ai e te Kōti ki te Karauna te hāwhe whaka-te-tonga o te poraka whenua o Rotoitipaku. Nō te 25 o Hūne o te tau 1883 tuhi atu ai ētahi o Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) ki te Minita mō ngā Take Māori, e whakamārama ana i ngā whakahē o ētahi o Ngāti Tuwharetoa ki Kawerau me Ngāti Umutahi ki te hoko, me te pātai mēnā e pai ana kia whakahokia ngā moni he mea homai e te Karauna mō ngā whenua:
    
    (33) Nō te rironga atu o ō rātou whenua mā te raupatu, mā ngā māhi hoko a te Karauna me ētahi atu tikanga wehe i te tāngata mai i ōna whenua, he mea uaua i nāianei mō Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) ki te whātoro ki ana rawa pēnei i te takutai me ngā repo, me kī, ngā kaiwhakarato kai, rongoā, haumaru hoki. Ka ngaro hoki tō rātou mana ki runga i ētahi o ō rātou urupā me ō rātou wāhi nui. Hei tā Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) he pēhi kino tēnei i runga i tō rātou hononga ā-wairua, ā-kikokiko me te whenua:
    
    ###### Ngā Nekeneke o te Rau Tau 20
    
    (34) Mai i te timatanga o te tekau tau 1890 i ngana ngā tāngata whai kia whakatahea ngā wai o te repo o Rangitaiki, e noho ātaahua ake ai te whenua mō ngā mahi ahuwhenua. I whakaae te Karauna ki tēnei mahi. Nō te tau 1910 ka riro mā te Karauna e whakahaere ngā mahi whakatahe wai ā, nō te tau 1914 oti ai te keria o tētahi maero e puta tika ai te awa o Rangitaiki ki te moana. Rerekē katoa te āhua o ngā repo i ngā mahi kerikeri me te aha, ka raru ngā wāhi tapu me ngā wāhi kohi kai, aha noa atu:
    
    (35) Nō te tekau tau 1950 whakaturia ai te tāone me te mīra pepa o Kawerau, i runga paku noa ake o te kāinga o Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty). Ko te otinga, ko te whakaparuparu me te whakaparahako i te awa o Tarawera (he wāhi nui mō te mahi kai, rawa hoki) me te takiwā o Ōkākāru (e ai ki a Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty), he wāhi tenei mō te whakaora me te whakangā) i ngā paru mai i ngā kāinga, ahumahi hoki. Nā te Tasman Pulp and Paper Company Enabling Act 1954 i mana ai te tuku para mai i te mīra ki te awa o Tarawera, i raro i ngā aratohu a te Pollution Advisory Council:
    
    (36) Nā te whakamanatanga o te Geothermal Energy Act 1953, ka riro ki te Karauna anake ngā tika mō ngā rawa ngāwhā. Kāore te Karauna i kōrero ki a Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) i mua o tana haere i tēnei huarahi. Nā runga i tēnei mahi, kua kore te mana me te āheinga o Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) ki ngā rawa ngāwhā kei te takiwā o Kawerau:
    
    ###### Ngā Kerēme o Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) me ngā Whakaritenga mō te Whakataunga
    
    (37) Ki tā Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty), i takahia e te Karauna te Tiriti o Waitangi, me te aha, kua pā mai ngā whakawhiunga ki te iwi. Mai anō i te wā o te raupatu, kua rapu a Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) i te tika mō ēnei takahitanga o te Tiriti kei te whakapaetia. Puta noa i ngā rau tau 19 me te 20, kua pīkauria e Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) tana whakamau ki te Karauna, mā ngā petihana me ngā hui me ngā āpiha a te Karauna i Kawerau, i Matatā, me Te Whanganui-a-Tara. Kāore tonu i aro mai te Karauna ki ēnei tono; kua noho tēnei hei whakamau nui mā Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty):
    
    (38) Nō te tau 1988 rehitatia ai e Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) tana kerēme raupatu (Wai 62), whai muri o tētahi whakahōunga o Te Ture mō [Te Tiriti o Waitangi][173] e aha ai, e tareka ai te tirohia o ngā kerēme hoki rā anō ki te tau 1840\. I te tau 1994 me te tau 1995 i rongohia e Te Rōpu Whakamana i te Tiriti te kerēme a Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) i te marae i Hāhuru me ētahi atu wāhi; hei wāhanga noa ēnei noho o ngā noho a Te Rōpu Whakamana i te Tiriti i te rohe o Te Waiariki ki te rāwhiti. I taua wā i aro nui Te Rōpu Whakamana i te Tiriti ki te tūranga o Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) hei rōpu motuhake me ""ana kerēme nui, whai kiko hoki"" i te rohe o Te Waiariki ki te rāwhiti. Nō te marama o Oketopa o te tau 1999 whākina ai ngā putanga a Te Rōpu Whakamana i te Tiriti e pā ana ki ana noho i Te Waiariki ki te rāwhiti:
    
    (39) Nō te marama o Hānuere o te tau 1998 tukuna ai e Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) tētahi Whakaaetanga Mana Kōkiri ki te Karauna ā, nō te marama o Maehe o te tau 1998 mana ai te mana kōkiri, ki ta te Karauna titiro. Ka whakamanatia e ngā kaiwhakarite i tētahi hui-a-iwi i tū ki te marae o Ngāti Umutahi, ā, tīmata ana ngā whakarite me te Karauna:
    
    (40) Nō te marama o Ākuhata o te tau 1998 whakatakotoria ai e Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) ki mua i te aroaro o te Karauna te whakamārama mō ngā whakamau i te iwi i roto i ngā tau i mua o te tau 1992, kia tāpaea ki te taha o te kerēme Wai 62\. I roto i ngā whakamau i tāpaea e Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) ko ngā rongotanga i ngā mamae o te raupatu i runga i a Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) e rongohia tonu i tēnei wā tonu, te tauwehe o ngā whenua i hē te raupatu, te korenga ake o te whakamahi, whakahaere me te whai hua mai i ēnei whenua me ngā rawa pēnei i ngā awaawa. I uru atu ki ēnei whakapā kino, ko te keria o te repo o Rangitaiki, te rironga atu o ngā rawa ngāwhā (he taonga nui rawa atu tēnei nā Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty)) me ngā putanga o te whakatū o te tāone o Kawerau me te ahumahi pepa:
    
    (41) Nō te 8 o te marama o Hepetema 1998 hainahia ai e Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) me te Karauna Ngā Tikanga Whakarite ā, ko tāna, he whakamārama i te hōkai, ngā whāinga me ngā tikanga whakahaere i ngā whakaritenga:
    
    (42) I raro i Ngā Tikanga Whakarite, i whakaū ngā kaiwhakarite whaimana ki te Karauna, he mana kōkiri tā rātou ki te tū hei māngai mō Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) i roto i ngā whakaritenga me te Karauna mō te whakatau o ngā kerēme katoa:
    
    (43) Tīmata ai ngā whakaritenga whai kiko i waenganui i te Karauna me Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) i te marama o Oketopa o te tau 1998\. I titiro ēnei whakaritenga ki ngā whakamau i roto i ngā tau i whakaarahia ake e Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) pēnei i ngā ture whenua Māori, te whakatakitahi i ngā taitara whenua me ngā ture mahi tumatanui. Nō te marama o Tīhema o te 2000 whakaae tahi ai a Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) me te Karauna mō te whānui o te whakatika hapa ā, nō te marama o Hānuere o te tau 2001 whakatakotoria ai e te Karauna tana tāpaetanga:
    
    (44) I te 22 o Oketopa 2002 ka whakaretangia e te Karauna me Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) he whakaaetanga o ngā whakataunga. Ka tatū i te Karauna me Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) taua whakaaetanga o ngā whakataunga i te 6 o Hune 2003, e whakatatū ana i ngā take katoa e tika ana kia whakatauria tuturutia te katoa o ngā kerēme o neherā o te iwi o Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty).
    
    ##### Background
    
    (1) The [Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti o Waitangi)][173], as set out in English and in Māori in Schedule 1 of the Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975, was signed in 1840:
    
    (2) Recitals (3) to (44) of this Preamble present, in summary form, the background to the Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) historical claims that is set out in the deed of settlement entered into by Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) and the Crown:
    
    ###### Historical account
    
    (3) The acknowledgements and the apology from the Crown to Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) are based on the following historical account:
    
    ###### Rohe of Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty)
    
    Ko Pūtauaki te Maunga, Ko Te Takanga i ō Apa te Awa, Ko Te Aotahi te Tangata, Ko Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) te Iwi:
    
    (4) Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) describe their rohe as running from Ōtamarākau following the Waitahanui Stream to Ōtari to Motuotara to Maungawhakamana to Ngārararua in Haehaenga territory to Kākahuoteritenga to Waikareao to Maraetahia to Monehu to Ōkorotere to Panepane to Pūtauaki to Tāhuna to Rākeihopukia to Wahieroa to Rurima to Ōtamarākau. The rohe of Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) as described extends beyond the confiscation lines. The Rangitaiki and Tarawera rivers are the major rivers within the rohe. Significant tribal pūkorero are connected to these tribal landmarks:
    
    (5) As tangata whenua of the described rohe, places of historical and cultural significance to Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) include Ōtamarākau, Ōtari, Motuotara, Maungawhakamana, Ngārararua, Haehaenga, Kākahuoteritenga, Waikareao, Maraetahia, Te Monehu, Ōkorotere, Panepane, Pūtauaki, Tāhuna, Rākeihopukia, Wahieroa, Rurima Islands, Ōtaramuturangi, Pāniwhaniwha (Ngāpariwhakairo), Mangāti, Tūwatawata, Te Waikoukou, Moturoa, Puketapu, Ōtukoiro, Te Kiore Pohoroa, Korotiwha, Otitapu, Paokoroiti, Te Pātaua, Te Pakipaki, Tainapekapeka, Taumanawa, Tūmanuka, Peketā, Te Waha o te Parata, Ōpeke, Tāhunaroa, Tahutu, Whakarewa, Ōniao, Umuhika, Hāhūru, Ōkōtuku, Ōwhirirangi, Whātangi, Koroaha, Tutarautawhai, Parangaehe, Mangapehi, Ōterangikahamai, Poutakamoko, Pukehīnau, Pokanui, Ōteao, Te Ahi-inanga, Te Atua Reretahi, Te Kopua, Huratoki, Te Haehaenga, Ōtangihia, Pōkohu, Ōtangiwaka, Taranaki, Mātirawhāiti, Whakapaukōrero, Whakapaukarakia, Mōkaingārara, Ōhinetewai, Tūhaepō, Te Kōhika, Te Ahikōkōwai, Kākaramea, Whakahoro, Mangawhio, and Ruataniwha. Waterways include: Waitahanui, Hauone, Herepuru, Pikowai, Mimiha/Whakarewa, Ōhinekoao, Waihoko, Kohi-o-Awa, Wai-te-Ariki, Wai-te-puru, Awakaponga, Whāriki-te-toki, Waikamihi, Wairere-a-tu (the name by which Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) know the Braemar Springs), Pōkerekere, and Te Kaokaoroa:
    
    (6) Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) state that prior to 1866 they were actively engaged in the cultivation of large kumara gardens, potatoes, wheat, and flax for sale to and barter with local European traders, and the transport of goods to markets. They were also involved in customary trade with other iwi. The area at Ōkākāru (geothermal region) in the Kawerau area was used as a special place of healing and recuperation and for early cultivation of plants, in particular kumara. The area was also famous for the plentiful supply of eels and fish and the breeding of eels, especially in the warmest thermal waters. Transport was by waka and the surrounding wetlands were plentiful in kai:
    
    ###### Background to Raupatu---Conflict in Eastern Bay of Plenty
    
    (7) In July 1863, war broke out between the Crown and Māori in the Waikato; as part of this conflict hostilities occurred in the Bay of Plenty during the first half of 1864:
    
    (8) Following a period of unrest, a Crown official, James Fulloon, and 3 crew members of the vessel _Kate_ were killed by some local Māori at Whakatāne in July 1865\. T H Smith, the Civil Commissioner at Maketū, issued a warrant for the arrests of those alleged to have taken part in the murders on board the _Kate_:
    
    (9) In August 1865, a Crown expedition of some 500 men, including Māori from neighbouring iwi and hapū, was mounted under Major William Mair, Resident Magistrate, to apprehend those named in the warrant. They pursued those named in the warrant, laying siege to a number of pā in the eastern Bay of Plenty. Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) hapū resided at some of these pā:
    
    (10) Fighting broke out as the Crown expedition passed Pārawai Pā. Crown troops raided livestock and pillaged crops and food supplies but failed to take the pā. The troops moved onto Te Umuhika where they became involved in a skirmish with some people from Pārawai Pā. In the ensuing conflict Hoete, of Te Tāwera hapū, was shot 3 times and died, defending the pā and his kin from the troops. Others of Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) who were accused of harbouring ""tangata hara"" were killed as the Crown expedition moved towards Te Kupenga. According to Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty), a number of those killed were providing customary hospitality to those being pursued by the Crown:
    
    (11) On 2 September 1865, the Crown issued a proclamation of peace, declaring the war at an end. The proclamation stated that those who had taken up arms against the Crown since 1863 would not be prosecuted for past offences. Those responsible for the killings of Fulloon and others were among those excluded from this amnesty. The proclamation also stated that if those responsible for the killing of Fulloon were not given up then ""the Governor will seize a part of the lands of the Tribes who conceal these murderers"":
    
    (12) On 4 September 1865, the Governor issued a proclamation of martial law in the Whakatāne and Ōpotiki areas to enable the capture of those accused of the murder of Fulloon and others. Crown troops remained stationed outside some pā, for the purpose of pursuing those thought to be involved in the murders:
    
    (13) Around October 1865, the occupants of Pārawai Pā evacuated and went to Te Kupenga Pā, joining other Bay of Plenty iwi, including some of the individuals listed in the arrest warrant. Crown troops attacked Te Kupenga. On 20 October 1865 all those remaining at Te Kupenga surrendered to the Crown force:
    
    ###### Confiscation under New Zealand Settlements Act 1863
    
    (14) By an Order in Council on 17 January 1866, the Crown confiscated approximately 448 000 acres of land in the eastern Bay of Plenty under the New Zealand Settlements Act 1863\. The description of the confiscation boundary was amended by a subsequent Crown proclamation of 1 September 1866\. The confiscated area included approximately 87 000 acres of the traditional lands of Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty):
    
    (15) According to the legislation, 2 of the purposes of the New Zealand Settlements Act 1863 were to provide permanent peace and security, and establish and maintain the Queen's authority. The Act described the introduction of a sufficient number of settlers as ""the best and most effectual means"" of achieving those purposes:
    
    (16) The Act did not mention punishment, but was punitive in nature. It was used to effect the confiscation of Māori land whenever the Governor in Council was satisfied that ""any Native Tribe or Section of a Tribe or any considerable number thereof"" had been engaged in ""rebellion"" against the authority of the Queen since 1 January 1863\. The Governor could proclaim a district, for the purposes of the Act, where there was any land owned in that district by those deemed to have been in rebellion:
    
    (17) The Crown considered the Bay of Plenty tribes to have been in rebellion because of the ""resistance"" to the forces sent into the area to arrest those responsible for the deaths of Fulloon and others:
    
    ###### The compensation process
    
    (18) The Compensation Court was established under the provisions of the New Zealand Settlements Act 1863 to hear claims for the return of confiscated land. Prior to the sitting of the Compensation Court, Crown Agent John A Wilson was appointed as a special commissioner in February 1866 to deal with the allocation of confiscated land in the Bay of Plenty:
    
    (19) Wilson arranged for approximately 87 000 acres of confiscated land between the western confiscation boundary and the Tarawera River to be divided into blocks. Much of this area, which Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) and other iwi also claim, went to certain Te Arawa iwi and others as military awards. Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) also lost lands, which they traditionally held interests in on the eastern side of the Tarawera River:
    
    (20) The Compensation Court heard evidence from members of Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) in relation to land within the confiscation boundary on the west side of the Tarawera River. The Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) claims recognised by the court included those for the Tawhitinui block (6 320 acres) and the Rotoitipaku block (13 675 acres):
    
    (21) In December 1867, the Compensation Court awarded the Rotoitipaku block to 10 people and the Tawhitinui block to 13 people. These awards were made on the basis that they were the rightful owners and not implicated in the ""rebellion"":
    
    (22) Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) viewed the awards of these blocks as a tribal endowment with the named individuals acting as kaitiaki or trustees for the hapū. However, when the Compensation Court awards were officially notified in the _Gazette_ 7 years later, in 1874, there was no mention of trustees. Rather the blocks were officially awarded to the listed individuals as grantees:
    
    (23) Members of Te Tāwera hapū were granted land in the Umuhika area, in accordance with an arrangement made by Wilson, who noted that Te Tāwera had been major landholders in the area prior to the war:
    
    (24) In December 1867, the Compensation Court also awarded 10 individuals 50 acre blocks within the Rotoitipaku and Tawhitinui blocks. All of these awards were made under sections 4 and 6 of the Confiscated Land Act 1867, which allowed the return of land to those considered by the Crown to be ""surrendered rebels"":
    
    (25) Wilson carried out his activities under the provisions of the New Zealand Settlements Act 1863 and its amendments. The Crown then enacted further legislation, including the Confiscated Lands Act 1867, in order to validate Wilson's arrangements:
    
    (26) While Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) were granted some land through the compensation process, they lost their customary rights of access to other traditional lands and resources:
    
    (27) Land restored through the compensation process was returned to individuals rather than to the hapū or iwi. The awards did not reflect the customary forms of tenure and land became more susceptible to partition and alienation:
    
    ###### Crown purchases
    
    (28) In 1873, Crown land purchase agents began negotiating to lease the Rotoitipaku and Tawhitinui blocks. Eight Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) men signed a deed of lease for the blocks. Some of these men were listed as trustees for the 2 blocks in the schedules Wilson prepared of the compensation awards:
    
    (29) In 1874, after publication of the awards for the Rotoitipaku and Tawhitinui blocks in the _Gazette_, it became clear that the existing deed of lease did not have the appropriate signatories. Crown land purchase agents attempted to complete the lease deeds by obtaining the signatures for all the grantees listed in the _Gazette_ notice. This proved difficult for a number of reasons, including administrative difficulties and the absence of some grantees from the area. The Crown subsequently decided to attempt to purchase the blocks instead:
    
    (30) In 1878, a number of areas within the Rotoitipaku and Tawhitinui blocks were set aside and, in many cases, surveyed as reserves under instruction from Crown officials. During negotiations with some of the grantees the following year, the Crown land purchase agent agreed that these reserves would be excluded from purchase:
    
    (31) Over the next few years, the Crown negotiated with some of the owners, purchasing all of the Tawhitinui block in 1883\. An 88 acre reserve was excluded from the sale:
    
    (32) Crown agents also negotiated the purchase of the interests of 5 of the grantees of the Rotoitipaku block. Some of the other grantees wrote to the Minister of Native Affairs in December 1882 objecting to the sale. The Crown applied to the Native Land Court to have its interest in the block declared. During the Native Land Court hearing some non-selling grantees opposed the land being sold without the consent of all 10 of the grantees and the backing of their hapū. Despite their objections, the court awarded the southern half of Rotoitipaku to the Crown on 25 June 1883\. There was no provision for reserves within the section of Rotoitipaku awarded to the Crown. Members of Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) wrote to the Minister of Native Affairs on 25 June 1883, outlining the objections of some Ngāti Tuwharetoa around the Kawerau area and Ngāti Umutahi to the sale and asking to be allowed to return the money advanced by the Government:
    
    (33) The loss of their traditional lands through confiscation, Crown purchases and other alienations under the native land laws has impacted on the access of Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) to resources such as the coast and the swamp that traditionally provided food, medicine, and shelter. They also lost control over some of their urupā and significant sites. Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) state that this has had an ongoing impact on the spiritual and physical relationship of the iwi with the land:
    
    ###### 20th century developments
    
    (34) From the early 1890s onwards, attempts were made by settlers, with the sanction of the Government, to drain the Rangitaiki swamp area to make it more suitable for farming. The Government took over the local land drainage scheme in 1910 and in 1914 a channel was cut to provide the Rangitaiki River with a direct route to the sea. The physical characteristics of these wetlands were significantly altered by the drainage and river diversion scheme, and this affected Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) wāhi tapu and traditional gathering areas for food and other resources:
    
    (35) In the 1950s, the Kawerau township and pulp and paper mill were established above the settlement of Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty). These developments resulted in the pollution and degradation of the Tarawera River (which was a valuable food and water resource for Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty)) and the Ōkākāru area (which Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) hold to be a historically significant area for healing and recuperation), by urban and industrial waste. The Tasman Pulp and Paper Company Enabling Act 1954 authorised the discharge of waste from the mill into the Tarawera River in accordance with Pollution Advisory Council guidelines:
    
    (36) With the passing of the Geothermal Energy Act 1953, the Crown established for itself, without the consent of Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty), the sole right to the geothermal energy resource. In relation to the Kawerau geothermal field, this has resulted in Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) losing control of and access to geothermal resources in the area:
    
    ###### The claims of Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) and settlement negotiations
    
    (37) Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) considers that the Crown has breached the [Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti o Waitangi)][173] and caused significant prejudice to the iwi. Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) have sought justice for these alleged Treaty breaches since the raupatu. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries a number of Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) tangata have carried their grievance to the Crown through petitions and in meetings with Crown officials in Kawerau, Matatā, and in Wellington. The failure of the Crown to redress these wrongs has also become a significant grievance for Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty):
    
    (38) Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) registered their raupatu claim (Wai 62) in 1988, following a 1985 amendment to the [Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975][174] to allow the hearing of claims back to 1840\. The Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) claim was heard by the Waitangi Tribunal at Hāhuru marae and at other venues as part of the Eastern Bay of Plenty hearings during the course of 1994 and 1995\. At that time the Waitangi Tribunal recognised the status of Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) as an independent group with ""significant and compelling claims"" in the eastern Bay of Plenty area. The findings of the Waitangi Tribunal in relation to the Eastern Bay of Plenty hearings were released in October 1999:
    
    (39) Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) submitted a deed of mandate to the Crown in January 1998 and the Crown recognised the mandate in March 1998\. Negotiators were mandated at a hui-a-iwi at Ngāti Umutahi marae, Matatā, and negotiations with the Crown commenced:
    
    (40) In August 1998, Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) presented the Crown with a detailed statement of all the historical grievances of the iwi prior to 1992 to be addressed alongside the Wai 62 claim. The grievances that Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) presented included the ongoing impact of the raupatu on Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty), subsequent alienation of wrongly confiscated lands, the loss of use, control, and benefits of these lands and resources including waterways. The drainage of the Rangitaiki wetlands, loss of geothermal resource (a key taonga of Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty)), and the impact on Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) of the development of the Kawerau township and the pulp and paper industry were also stated to be grievances of Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty):
    
    (41) Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) and the Crown signed terms of negotiation on 8 September 1998 which specified the scope, objectives, and general procedures for negotiations:
    
    (42) Under the terms of negotiation, the mandated negotiators confirmed to the Crown that they had a mandate to represent Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) in negotiations with the Crown for settlement of all the historical claims:
    
    (43) Substantive negotiations between the Crown and Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) began in October 1998\. These negotiations addressed all the historical grievances raised by Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) including the native land laws, individualisation of title, and public works legislation. The Crown and Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) agreed on the scope of the total redress package in December 2000, and the Crown made a settlement offer in January 2001:
    
    (44) The Crown and Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) initialled a deed of settlement on 22 October 2002\. Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) ratified the Crown's settlement offer and entered into a deed of settlement on 6 June 2003 recording matters to give effect to a full and final settlement of all the historical claims of Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty).

    *   (b) na te raupatu o ngā whenua o Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) ka pa te kino ki runga i te noho, te ohanga me te whakapakaritanga o Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty), ka aukatia te iwi ki ona rawa taiao me ona wāhi tapu, ka whai wāhi hoki ki te noho wehe me te marara o te iwi; a
    
    *   (c) kaore i te tika tana raupatu i ngā whenua o Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty), i tua atu, he takahitanga tenei o te Tiriti o Waitangi me ona matapono.
    
    (3) E whakaae ana te Karauna:
        
    *   (a) i pupū ake i te raupatu, ko te whakatoihara a, na ngā tupuhitanga o te whakahaere o Te Kōti Pāremata ka kino ake te pa mai o taua whakatoihara; a

##### 8 Text of acknowledgements in English
    
*   The text of the acknowledgements in English as set out in the deed of settlement is as follows:
    
    (1) The Crown acknowledges that the people of Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) have sought acknowledgement of their grievances since the raupatu and that recognition of these grievances is long overdue. The Crown hereby acknowledges the legitimacy of the Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) historical grievances and makes the following acknowledgements.
    
    (2) The Crown acknowledges that:
        
    *   (a) its confiscation of Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) lands in the Eastern Bay of Plenty by means of the New Zealand Settlements Act 1863 extinguished Māori customary title to land and deprived Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) of tribal lands and resources; and
    
    *   (b) the confiscation of Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) lands had a damaging effect on the welfare, economy, and development of Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty), deprived the iwi of access to its traditional natural resources and wāhi tapu, and contributed significantly to the subsequent dislocation and fragmentation of the iwi; and
    
    *   (c) its confiscation of Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) lands was unjust and a breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti o Waitangi)][173] and its principles.
    
    (3) The Crown acknowledges that:
        
    *   (a) the prejudice created by the confiscation was compounded by inadequacies in the Compensation Court process; and
    
    *   (b) the confiscations were indiscriminate in that the Crown failed to return land in full to those it did not consider to have been involved in the actions that prompted the confiscation; and
    
    *   (c) some Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) land was awarded to other iwi. As a result some Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) tangata were dislocated from the lands they traditionally occupied and cultivated; and
    
    *   (d) Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty)'s traditional tribal estate was further reduced by transfer under the native land laws, including Crown purchases; and
    
    *   (e) the Compensation Court and the Native Land Court awarded land to individuals rather than iwi or hapū. This was not consistent with customary tenure and made those lands more susceptible to partition and alienation; and
    
    *   (f) these actions eroded the traditional social structures, mana, and rangatiratanga of Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty). The Crown failed to adequately protect Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) from the impact of these actions and this was a breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti o Waitangi)][173] and its principles.
    
    (4) The Crown acknowledges that the cumulative effect of the Crown's actions, particularly its failure to actively protect Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) interests in the land they wished to retain has left the iwi virtually landless. The Crown breached the [Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti o Waitangi)][173] by failing to ensure that Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) were left with sufficient land for their present and future needs.
    
    (5) The Crown acknowledges that the following matters have caused a sense of grievance within Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) that is still held today:
        
    *   (a) the passing of the Geothermal Energy Act 1953 by the Crown (without the consent of Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty)); and
    
    *   (b) Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) having lost control of, and access to, the Kawerau Geothermal system; and
    
    *   (c) the pollution and degradation of the Tarawera River and the Okākāru area.
    
    (6) The Crown acknowledges that:
        
    *   (a) the lands confiscated from Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) have made a valuable contribution to the wealth and development of the nation; and
    
    *   (b) the other resources, such as the geothermal resource, taken without the consent of Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty), have made a valuable contribution to the wealth and development of the nation; and
    
    *   (c) most Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) people have demonstrated a record of co-operation with the Government from 1840\. Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) has honoured its obligations and responsibilities under the [Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti o Waitangi)][173], especially, but not exclusively, in its contribution to New Zealand's war effort overseas. The Crown pays tribute to the contribution made by Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) to the defence of the nation.

*   The text of the apology in Māori as set out in the deed of settlement is as follows:
    
    (1) E aro ana te Karauna ki ngā okeoke a ngā tīpuna o Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) i a ratou ka whai i a ratou kereme mo te tika ki te Karauna mai i te wā o te raupatu. I tua atu ka tuku whakapaha te Karauna ki a Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty), ki o ratou tīpuna me o ratou uri whakaheke.
    
    (2) E tino awhitu ana, e tino whakapaha ana te Karauna mo ana takahitanga i [Te Tiriti o Waitangi][173] me ona matapono, e whakamaramatia ana i runga ake nei.
    
    (3) Ko te mea nui, e tino awhitu ana, e tino whakapaha ana te Karauna mo tana raupatu i ngā whenua o Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty), me ngā whakawhiunga mai i ana mahi i pa ki ngā whakatipūranga, tapae atu ko ngā putanga kino ki te hapori, te ohanga, te taiao me te whakapakaritanga o Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty).
    
    (4) Ka tino awhitu te Karauna mo tana kore aro ki te mana me te rangatiratanga o Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty).
    
    (5) Na reira, i runga i tenei whakapaha, e rapū ana te Karauna kia whakahāngaitia enei he ōna, katahi ia ka tīmata ki te whakapai i te hononga. E rika ana te Karauna kia tu mai tetahi hononga, ko tona putake ko te whakawhirinakitanga me te mahi tahi me Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty).

##### 10 Text of apology in English
    
*   The text of the apology in English as set out in the deed of settlement is as follows:
    
    (1) The Crown recognises the struggles of the ancestors of Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) in pursuit of their claims for justice against the Crown since the raupatu and hereby makes this apology to Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty), to their ancestors, and to their descendants.
    
    (2) The Crown profoundly regrets and unreservedly apologises for the breaches of the [Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti o Waitangi)][173] and its principles.
    
    (3) In particular, the Crown profoundly regrets and unreservedly apologises for its confiscation of Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) lands and for the cumulative effect of its actions over the generations, which have had a damaging effect on the welfare, economy, environment, and development of Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty).
    
    (4) The Crown profoundly regrets its failure to acknowledge the mana and rangatiratanga of Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty).
    
    (5) Accordingly, with this apology, the Crown seeks to atone for these wrongs and to begin the process of healing. The Crown looks forward to building a relationship of mutual trust and co-operation with Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty).

## Schedule 4  
Statutory acknowledgement for Rotoma Forest Conservation Area

[s 37][57]

#### Statutory area

The area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the area known as the Rotoma Forest Conservation Area, as shown on SO 61717, South Auckland Land District.

#### Preamble

Under [section 37][57], the Crown acknowledges the statement by Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) of the cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association of Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) with the Rotoma Forest Conservation Area as set out below.

#### Cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association of Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) with statutory area

For Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) whānui, Te Atua Reretahi, which is within the Rotoma Forest Conservation Area, is a very sacred urupā (burial place). This is because our eponymous ancestor Tuwharetoa is buried there. The caves that extend beyond Te Atua Reretahi into the adjacent Apurangi and Tautara basins are also the resting places of many of the descendants of Tuwharetoa.

Te Ngako o te Rangi (a descendent of Tuwharetoa) prepared a special cave at Te Atua Reretahi as the burial place for Tuwharetoa. Other ancestors were also taken there. It is for this reason that Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty)---whānau, hapū, and iwi---acknowledge the whakatauki: neke neke atu, ko te Waha o te Pārata, aue ko Te Atua Reretahi, ko Mawake Taupo, ko Hine-te-Ariki, ko Hāhuru, ko ngā kāhui Ariki, moe mai i te moenga roa ee ee.

It is particularly significant to Tuwharetoa people as visiting the urupā is a special occasion for us. Our tupuna have resided over our tribal area since time immemorial.

The spiritual and cultural values of the resting place of our tupuna have been passed down to us, helping our people endure the events of the last 150 years. For the uri (descendants) of Tuwharetoa, Te Atua Reretahi is a place of healing. It is a place that binds all the people from the mountain to the sea.

The resting place of our tupuna is as old as the maunga and as young as the fresh morning dew. It is ageless as time itself, it passes us by every day but will never pass on. Tuwharetoa cannot be separated from Te Atua Reretahi as it is in our hearts, our bodies, and it is the very essence of our soul. We are Tuwharetoa Te Atua Reretahi. Let us remember those who died in the struggle and there have been many.

This area of land was once a stronghold of Ngāti Mawake, ancestors of Tuwharetoa. They were descendants of Ngatoroirangi, the high priest on the Te Arawa waka, and lived from Apurangi to Haehaenga.

In the area of the Rotoma Forest Conservation Area, Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) people traditionally hunted birds such as the kererū (native wood pigeon), weka, tūī, kāhu, and kiwi and, after their introduction, animals such as possums, deer, and pigs.

The area supplied Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) people with many other sources of food. The berries of tutu, hīnau, tawa, and miro all grew within the area and could be eaten in various forms. The fleshy white leaf of the tāwhara was considered a prized delicacy, and the kiekie plant was a key resource. The tī kōuka (cabbage tree) and mingi mingi (tūmingi) shrub provided food for Tuwharetoa people. The young uncurled shoots of the pikopiko fern were collected for greens. Small berries of several other trees, such as rimu, kahikatea, and mataī, were eaten.

Other significant food sources in this area were the makaika (a species of Māori potato) and the mamaku (giant tree fern). Selected trees, such as rātā, tōtara, and kahikatea, were used for the building of canoes, weapons, and houses and to make tools. The kaponga tree fern was valuable for many different applications: the leaves were used for shelter, the bark for medicine, and the shape for art.

#### Purposes of statutory acknowledgement

Under [section 38][58], and without limiting the rest of this schedule, the only purposes of this statutory acknowledgement are---
    
*   (a) to require that relevant consent authorities, Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga, or the Environment Court, as the case may be, have regard to this statutory acknowledgement in relation to the Rotoma Forest Conservation Area, as provided in [sections 39 to 41][59]; and

*   (b) to require that relevant consent authorities forward summaries of resource consent applications to the governance entity as provided in [section 43][63]; and

*   (c) to enable the governance entity and any member of Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) to cite this statutory acknowledgement as evidence of the association of Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) with the Rotoma Forest Conservation Area as provided in [section 44][64].

#### Limitations on effect of statutory acknowledgement

Except as expressly provided in [sections 39 to 41][59],---
    
*   (a) this statutory acknowledgement does not affect, and is not to be taken into account in, the exercise of any power, duty, or function by any person or entity under any statute, regulation, or bylaw; and

*   (b) without limiting paragraph (a), no person or entity, in considering any matter or making any decision or recommendation under statute, regulation, or bylaw, may give any greater or lesser weight to the association of Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) with the Rotoma Forest Conservation Area than that person or entity would give under the relevant statute, regulation, or bylaw, if this statutory acknowledgement had not been made.

Except as expressly provided in [subpart 3][55] of Part 4, this statutory acknowledgement does not affect the lawful rights or interests of any person who is not a party to the deed of settlement.

Except as expressly provided in [subpart 3][55] of Part 4, this statutory acknowledgement does not have the effect of granting, creating, or providing evidence of any estate or interest in, or any rights of any kind whatsoever relating to, the Rotoma Forest Conservation Area.

## Schedule 5  
Statutory acknowledgement for Lake Tamurenui Wildlife Management Reserve

[s 37][57]

#### Statutory area

The area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the area known as the Lake Tamurenui Wildlife Management Reserve, as shown on SO 61727, South Auckland Land District. The area includes the bed and waters of Lake Tamurenui.

#### Preamble

Under [section 37][57], the Crown acknowledges the statement by Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) of the cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association of Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) with the Lake Tamurenui Wildlife Management Reserve as set out below.

#### Cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association of Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) with statutory area

Tamurenui means large snapper. The Lake Tamurenui Wildlife Management Reserve was once part of the large marshlands of the area.

Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) believe that a kaitiaki (guardian) called Te Whakakau Ariki lives in Lake Tamurenui and looks after the lake. The kaitiaki holds the history of the Tuwharetoa people.

It is told by the elders that when a death occurred at Kawerau of a person of rank, Te Whakakau Ariki would dive beneath Lake Tamurenui, and journey through the mythical waters of Papatūānuku to reappear in Lake Taupo. If a leading person of rank died at Taupo, Te Whakakau Ariki would journey back and appear again at Lake Tamurenui. Te Whakakau Ariki was last seen by one of the elders in 1950, while he was setting a hīnaki (eel trap).

Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) people, who lived at ancient pā sites nearby, used the area for eeling, hunting pūkeko, and gathering kākahi (freshwater mussels). The area also provided resources such as morihana (carp) and raupō. Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) people used raupō for many different purposes, including making poi and for food. Pollen was collected and made into porridge or parāoa (bread) and the peeled roots were also eaten. Although pūkeko was eaten, it was particularly prized for its plumage to be made into korowai (cloak) decorations.

Morihana was traditionally caught at Lake Tamurenui from the beginning of the rainy season until late spring. Kaiherehere and matamoe eels were caught at the outlet of the lake every year. The eels were diverted into hīnaki traps with a pā tuna, a wing-type funnel made from wood and bags. The best time to catch the eels was at the beginning of autumn, when the eels begin their migratory journey to the sea.

## Schedule 6  
Statutory acknowledgement for Lake Rotoma Scenic Reserve

[s 37][57]

#### Statutory area

The area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the area known as the Lake Rotoma Scenic Reserve, as shown on SO 61726, South Auckland Land District. The area includes the bed and waters of the lagoon near Otumarokura Point.

#### Preamble

Under [section 37][57], the Crown acknowledges the statement by Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) of the cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association of Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) with the Lake Rotoma Scenic Reserve as set out below.

#### Cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association of Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) with statutory area

Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) has always been associated with the area of the Lake Rotoma Scenic Reserve through Rakeimarama, the first-born (matamua) son of Tuwharetoa. Rakeimarama was a highly respected tohunga because of his powerful incantations and sorcery. He could venture anywhere unchallenged. He lived on an island in Lake Rotoma with his iwi; they respected his command and were careful not to threaten the sanctuary of the island.

One fateful day, returning from visiting whanaunga (kindred) in another area, Rakeimarama arrived on the shore of Rotoma at his pā called Ngohiorangi. Feeling hungry after his journey he called to the people of the island to fetch him by canoe, as was the custom. Not receiving any response, he became very angry. Rakeimarama removed some clothing, tied flax around his waist, and ventured into the water. There he began to recite his incantations and summoned considerable powers. The tempest summoned by the karakia lashed the shores of Lake Rotoma with heavy rain and strong winds. The pā and the island slowly disappeared. If one ventures out on Lake Rotoma, sometimes the island can be seen just below the surface of the water.

Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) were also associated with the area which is now the Lake Rotoma Scenic Reserve through the hapū Ngāti Tiki, Ngāti Rahikora, and Ngāti Hinewai.

The boundary trees Tau-rangi and Te Wera-a-Tapahi, which were in the area of the Lake Rotoma Scenic Reserve, were significant boundary markers between the neighbouring western tribes and Tuwharetoa (through the hapū of Ngāti Umutahi) on the eastern shore of Lake Rotoma.

Traditionally, Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) people who lived at a kainga called Taraki fished at a fishing ground called Purehurehu, and gathered inanga (whitebait) and kōura (fresh water crayfish) in the area of what is now the scenic reserve: piki atu kei raro ko Te Tuwatawata, haere tika ana ki Maungawhakamana, titaha ana ki Otitapu, ko ngā tirohanga, o ngā Tipuna eee.

Otitapu was a lookout post, built high on the Tihetihe range within the Lake Rotoma Scenic Reserve. It served the several pā sites surrounding it, including Okoroiti and Okake to the south and Ōpeke and Waituhi to the east. It also served the Haupanapana track to the south and joined the Tararaika and the Tuwharetoa trails, which were used by Tuwharetoa people to travel to and from the coast.

There are burial caves around Otitapu which are sacred to Tuwharetoa people. Lake Rotoma Scenic Reserve was also the scene of a famous battle, called Rarapahore, in which Tuwharetoa people fought.

## Schedule 7  
Statutory acknowledgement for Rangitaiki River

[s 37][57]

#### Statutory area

The area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the area known as the Rangitaiki River, as shown on SO 61728, South Auckland Land District.

#### Preamble

Under [section 37][57], the Crown acknowledges the statement by Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) of the cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association of Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) with the Rangitaiki River as set out below.

#### Cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association of Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) with statutory area

A great river, like a full tide.

The Rangitaiki River was the traditional eastern boundary of Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty). The river has changed course a number of times. At one time it flowed through the great swamps that formerly existed in the area. Vegetation along the river was raupō, flax, and rushes with mānuka and tī kōuka (cabbage trees) on the higher ground.

Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) people relied on the Rangitaiki River for food, in particular eels, fish, and birds. The higher ground along the river banks provided places for cultivating kūmara (sweet potato) and rīwai (potato). They also gathered many resources from the river. Raupō, which was plentiful, was gathered for the thatching of houses. Flax was used for weaving and making ropes. There was also a specific area on the riverbank that was set aside for the dyeing of flax. Tī whanake (cabbage tree) leaves were used for cooking baskets as they did not deteriorate in the boiling water pools that the people used for cooking.

Along the river, Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) people made use of the geothermal resources. Sulphur was burned for long periods in sleeping houses to control mites and bugs. A small amount combined with wild honey was taken as rongoā (medicine). It was also rubbed into hakihaki (sores). Children with hakihaki were made to sit or lie covered in warm mud for half an hour or more as a cure. Hot pools along the river were used for bathing and general hygiene.

When Mātāriki (the Pleiades constellation) was first seen, usually before sunrise in the middle of winter, the people would set kūmara in beds in the warm earth and for 2 to 3 weeks tubers would sprout. This was the nursery from which the main crops would be planted. These were the resources that provided sustenance for the many hapū who lived up and down the banks of the Rangitaiki River.

The people travelled along the river by canoe, often to visit relatives, to the upper reaches and downstream to the sea where mullet, herring, and whitebait were caught. Specially made canoes were used for reclamation work.

## Schedule 8  
Statutory acknowledgement for Tarawera River

[s 37][57]

#### Statutory area

The area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the river known as the Tarawera River, as shown on SO 61729, South Auckland Land District.

#### Preamble

Under [section 37][57], the Crown acknowledges the statement by Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) of the cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association of Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) with the Tarawera River as set out below.

#### Cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association of Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) with statutory area

Ko Pūtauaki te Maunga, ko Te Takanga i ō Apa te Awa, ko Te Aotahi te Tāngata, ko Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) te iwi.

Before the 1886 Mount Tarawera eruption the Tarawera River flowed down the valley through what is now Kawerau. The area was once marshlands; a number of streams flowed through the swamps to join the Tarawera River. After the eruption, the Tarawera River changed course several times. This occurred as a result of flooding and through the efforts of settlers to prevent the river encroaching on surrounding land. Near the coast the Tarawera River merged with other rivers and flowed into the sea at Te Awa a Te Atua.

The traditional name of Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) for the Tarawera River was Takanga-i-ō-Apa, which means ""the falling of Apa"". Apa was an original inhabitant of the area who lived south of Pūtauaki. Once he encountered a moa---a pet of the local Tuwharetoa people. The bird was resting on one leg with its mouth open facing the southern wind. Upon seeing the bird, Apa crept slowly towards the resting bird and struck at the exposed leg. Immediately the bird struck out with the leg that was drawn up and knocked Apa over the cliff. The injury Apa received was a broken leg and subsequently he became known as Apa-Koke (which means ""Apa limping"").

The Tarawera River was a key resource for Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty). The iwi living along the banks of the Tarawera River were spiritually and emotionally bound to and physically sustained by its waters. Healing ceremonies were held by and in the river. All the families grew up around the river and played together in and along the river. Along the riverbanks hot springs and baths were dug and used communally. It was a very special way of life.

Canoes were the only mode of transport used on the river, because it flowed through a huge swamp area. Many hapū had secret canals linked to the river where they could quickly escape from invading tribes. The people used large canoes for reclamation work to supply building materials and shifting dirt. The reclamation work was done to enlarge islands for smaller canoes for everyday use. Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) people used the river for travelling long distances to tangi and other events; sometimes journeys could last well into the night as the travellers negotiated the many well-known waterways.

The Tarawera River was a very important source of food and raw materials for the Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) people who lived along its banks. The river provided the people with plentiful supplies of fish, watercress, kōura (freshwater crayfish), and kākahi (freshwater mussels), which were considered a delicacy. Eels were caught in the river, particularly matamoe (a black migratory eel) and rino (an eel with a silver belly). The great paewai eel also lived in the river. It is said that if one catches this type of eel it is a bad omen. Along the river banks the people gathered toetoe and tī whanake (cabbage tree) leaves (for use in cooking baskets), harakeke (flax---for food, medicine, and weaving), and raupō (for thatching of houses).

The Tarawera River ran like a thread through every family living along its banks.

## Schedule 9  
Owhakatihi

[ss 98--100][130]

#### Description of Owhakatihi

South Auckland Land District---Kawerau District. 39.7943 hectares, more or less, being Sections 2 and 3 SO 330677\. Balance _Gazette_ Notice H.257899\.

#### Preamble

Under [section 100][132], the Crown acknowledges the statement of Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) of their cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional values relating to Parimahana Scenic Reserve, as set out below.

#### Statement of Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) values relating to Parimahana Scenic Reserve

Parimahana Scenic Reserve is the name of the reserve which is situated west of the Ruruanga Stream that flows into the Tarawera River; the reserve also includes part of the slopes of the Tirotirowhetu Mountain.

Parimahana Scenic Reserve was named because of the spiritual significance it had in relation to the ngāwhā (geothermal) resources that were placed and left there so many years ago by the fire gods Pupu and Hoata, who were sent to Aotearoa by Hauhangaroa and Kuiwai from Hawaiiki, to assist their brother Ngatoroirangi who was overcome with extreme cold.

The ariki status of the people who lived in the area was nurtured by the rich resources it provided.

#### Hine-te-Ariki

Grandmother of Tuwharetoa, Hine-te-Ariki, was an ancestress and puhi who lived in the area of the Parimahana Scenic Reserve. She built a pā on Tirotirowhetu Mountain because it was part of her duties to the iwi to climb this mountain to check the position of the stars, so as to accurately gauge the correct time to plant the kūmara which was a substantial crop in those times.

#### Ngā Kohatu o Hine-te-Ariki

The stones of Hine-te-Ariki are significant to Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) and the Parimahana Scenic Reserve because these stones were placed for protection in the nearby Ruruanga Stream. They were placed by Hine-te-Ariki in such a way as to provide an inviting crossing for the unwary and a slippery wet end for the unfortunate, thereby being an effective security system.

At the same time that Hine-te-Ariki travelled to different kainga (homes) within her tribal rohe, Waitaha-Ariki-Kore, her future husband, was preparing to come to Aotearoa from Hawaiiki.

#### Tohia-o-te-Rangi

Tohia-o-te-Rangi was a leading chief of Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) who lived in the Parimahana area. His pā was called Te Rewha which was situated on the southern ridge of Tirotirowhetu Mountain.

Tohia-o-te-Rangi often used explicit means to win battles and he is commemorated on one of the veranda poles of Ōniao Marae at Te Awa-a-te-Atua, Matatā, in one of these explicit positions.

To the people of Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) these names have the following meanings:

Parimahanaabundance of warmth

Hine-te-Arikia high-ranking puhi

Tirotirowhetustar gazing

Ngāwhāgeothermal sulphur

Tohia-o-te-Rangiheavenly binding

Te Rewhanamed after Tohia-o-te-Rangi's father who had very bad eyesight
