An Act to give effect to certain provisions of the Deed of ""On Account"" Settlement, signed on 14 June 1996 by the Crown and by Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu as representative of Ngāi Tahu,---
    
*   (a) by vesting Tūtaepatu Lagoon in Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu; and

*   (b) by providing for the establishment of a recreation reserve at Woodend

*   #### Preamble
    
    Whereas---
        
    *   A Ngāi Tahu made claims against the Crown under the [Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975][26], and those claims have been the subject of 2 reports of the Waitangi Tribunal, the 1991 Ngāi Tahu Report and the 1995 Ancillary Claims Report:
    
    *   B since 1991 there have been a number of attempts by Ngāi Tahu and the Crown to reach a negotiated settlement of Ngāi Tahu's claims and to remove the sense of grievance felt by Ngāi Tahu:
    
    *   C the Crown and Ngāi Tahu, wishing to recommence negotiations towards a comprehensive settlement of all claims made by or on behalf of Ngāi Tahu or hāpu, whānau, or individuals within Ngāi Tahu Whānui against the Crown pursuant to the [Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975][26], have agreed to negotiate in good faith to achieve a settlement of all Ngāi Tahu's historical claims under the [Treaty of Waitangi][27] and Ngāi Tahu has agreed to an indefinite adjournment of certain litigation relating to the claims to allow those negotiations to take place:
    
    *   D as a sign of good faith and as a demonstration of the Crown's goodwill, and in recognition of the long process of negotiation that has already taken place between the parties, the Crown has agreed to renew and modify an offer it made to Ngāi Tahu in 1994 to provide certain redress to Ngāi Tahu on an ""on account"" basis, and Ngāi Tahu has accepted that modified offer:
    
    *   E Accordingly, on 14 June 1996, the Crown and Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu as representative of Ngāi Tahu signed a Deed of ""On Account"" Settlement, in which the Crown agreed that it would present for the consideration of Parliament legislation to provide for---
            
        *   (a) the revocation of the classification of the Tūtaepatu Lagoon as a Government purpose (wildlife management) reserve; and
        
        *   (b) the vesting of the Tūtaepatu Lagoon in Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu in fee simple free of any existing encumbrance, subject only to a public walkway under the [New Zealand Walkways Act 1990][28] over the south-eastern corner of the lagoon and exempted from the marginal strip requirements of [Part 4A][29] of the Conservation Act 1987, such vesting to be by way of gift from the Crown; and
        
        *   (c) the revocation of certain existing reserves and for the declaration, classification and vesting of a new recreation reserve conditional on the fulfilment of certain conditions; and
        
        *   (d) the inclusion of the Tūtaepatu Lagoon in the management plan for the new reserve.

##### Notes

###### 1 General

    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][48] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][49] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][50] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][51] and [17E][52] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
