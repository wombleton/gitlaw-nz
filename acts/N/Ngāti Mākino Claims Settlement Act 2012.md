*   #### Preamble
    
    ##### Summary of Ngāti Mākino historical account
    
    (1) Ngāti Mākino are part of the Te Arawa confederation of tribes and have strong connections to Ngāti Awa. Traditionally, they occupied the area between the Rotorua lakes and the Bay of Plenty coast where they existed as an independent iwi:
    
    (2) Ngāti Mākino did not sign the [Treaty of Waitangi][172], but during the 1840s and 1850s they dwelt peacefully with the few settlers in their rohe. The Crown gradually increased its presence in the Bay of Plenty from 1842 but applied little pressure on local Māori to sell their lands and customary law largely continued to prevail:
    
    (3) The war between the Crown and the Kīngitanga in the Waikato in 1863 brought an extended period of tension to the Bay of Plenty. The need to choose between support for the Crown, degrees of armed neutrality, and support for the Kīngitanga split Ngāti Mākino internally. At Kaokaoroa in 1864, Ngāti Mākino helped fight off a Kingite taua from the east coast. Not long afterwards, again seeking to keep hostilities from their territory, Ngāti Mākino battled Crown forces at Te Ranga, near Tauranga:
    
    (4) A new round of conflict began in 1865 when the Crown sought those responsible for the murders of a Crown official and others. Ngāti Mākino played no part in the killings. As a consequence of the conflict, the Crown deemed that certain tribes had been in rebellion and confiscated approximately 448 000 acres of land in the eastern Bay of Plenty under the New Zealand Settlements Act 1863\. While the confiscation was not directed specifically at them, all Ngāti Mākino were affected:
    
    (5) The Crown established a Compensation Court to return land to those who had not been in rebellion. Ngāti Mākino were among those awarded land by the court but some Ngāti Mākino were deemed to be rebels and were excluded from ownership. The court, moreover, returned land in a form inconsistent with customary tenure:
    
    (6) Ngāti Mākino's tribal system was further undermined by the operation of the native land laws introduced by the Crown in the 1860s. These laws established the Native Land Court to convert customary title into individual title derived from the Crown. Customary tenure was generally communal and accommodated multiple and overlapping interests to the same land, but Ngāti Mākino had no alternative but to use the court if they wished to secure legal title to their lands and participate in the new economy. The court, however, caused so much unrest amongst Bay of Plenty iwi that the Crown was forced to suspend its operations for several years:
    
    (7) Ngāti Mākino preferred to lease their lands to private parties but by the mid-1880s the Crown had bought the majority of Ngāti Mākino's lands. In securing title to their lands, Ngāti Mākino incurred heavy survey costs. The Crown emphasised the size of survey debts and wrongly let Ngāti Mākino believe that interest was accruing on them. The Crown also improperly prevented Ngāti Mākino from selling land to private parties:
    
    (8) By 1900, Ngāti Mākino were virtually landless. Nonetheless, in the early twentieth century the Crown compulsorily acquired further Ngāti Mākino land for public works and to establish scenic reserves. Private parties continued to purchase what little land remained, including the majority of Ngāti Mākino's Ōtamarākau and Whakarewa reserves, both of which were originally awarded with inalienable titles. In the 1920s, the Crown introduced schemes to consolidate and develop fragmented Māori land holdings, but Ngāti Mākino possessed insufficient land to participate or benefit from them as Ngāti Mākino. By 1992, only 0.6% of the combined area of the 3 major blocks in which Ngāti Mākino had interests remained in the hands of the iwi:
    
    (9) From the 1940s, many Ngāti Mākino moved to forestry settlements looking for work to alleviate poverty and develop new skills. The Crown encouraged this migration and the forest industry became an important part of the economic well-being of Ngāti Mākino. However, the Forest Service was restructured in the 1980s, causing extensive unemployment and dislocation amongst communities who relied on the forest industry, including Ngāti Mākino:

The Parliament of New Zealand therefore enacts as follows:

##### 6 The Crown's acknowledgements
    
*   (1) The Crown acknowledges that the people of Ngāti Mākino have long sought redress for their grievances, and that the Crown's withdrawal from earlier negotiations and the subsequent delay in settlement had a detrimental effect on Ngāti Mākino. The Crown hereby recognises the legitimacy of the historical grievances of Ngāti Mākino and makes the following acknowledgements.
    
    (2) The Crown acknowledges that when it despatched troops to the Bay of Plenty in 1864, following the outbreak of hostilities in the Waikato, Ngāti Mākino were drawn into the war and forced to choose between different allegiances. This split the iwi and pitted individuals and hapū against one another.
    
    (3) The Crown acknowledges that Ngāti Mākino suffered loss of life at the hands of Crown forces in the battle of Te Ranga in 1864\.
    
    (4) The Crown acknowledges that the confiscation in the eastern Bay of Plenty in 1866---
        
    *   (a) included some of Ngāti Mākino's land; and
    
    *   (b) affected all Ngāti Mākino, even those who had not been in conflict with the Crown; and
    
    *   (c) compulsorily extinguished customary title in the confiscation district; and
    
    *   (d) alienated land from those Ngāti Mākino the Crown deemed to be rebels; and
    
    *   (e) was, in its effects on Ngāti Mākino, unjust, indiscriminate, and a breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi][172] and its principles.
    
    (5) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) the Compensation Court awarded land to individuals rather than iwi or hapū, which was not consistent with customary tenure. This system was imposed on Ngāti Mākino; and
    
    *   (b) because some members of the iwi had been identified as rebels, Ngāti Mākino were forced to rely upon links to other iwi in their claims to the Compensation Court.
    
    (6) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) Ngāti Mākino sought to retain authority over the determination of the ownership of their land; and
    
    *   (b) Ngāti Mākino's tribal structure was based on collective tribal and hapū custodianship of land; and
    
    *   (c) the native land laws were enacted, in part, to facilitate the opening up of Māori land to Pākehā settlement. It was expected that Māori would abandon their tribal and communal structures as a result of the new system; and
    
    *   (d) the Native Land Court awarded land to individual Ngāti Mākino rather than to iwi or hapū, and that this made those lands more susceptible to alienation; and
    
    *   (e) the Crown failed to provide an effective form of corporate title until 1894\. Such a title would have enabled Ngāti Mākino to exercise control over their land collectively, but by 1894 all Ngāti Mākino lands were held under individualised titles.
    
    (7) The Crown acknowledges that the native land laws contributed to the erosion of the mana, rangatiratanga, and traditional tribal structures of Ngāti Mākino. The Crown also acknowledges that its failure to provide an effective means in the native land legislation for the collective administration of Ngāti Mākino lands until 1894 was a breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi][172].
    
    (8) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) by seeking to lease rather than sell land, Ngāti Mākino aimed to develop and retain their lands; and
    
    *   (b) the Crown undermined these efforts and applied pressure on Ngāti Mākino to sell by---
            
        *   (i) leading Ngāti Mākino to believe wrongly that interest was accruing on survey debts; and
        
        *   (ii) improperly using the Native Land Purchases Act 1877 to prevent private parties entering lease or sale negotiations with Ngāti Mākino in relation to the Tāhunaroa block; and
        
        
    
    *   (c) as a result, Ngāti Mākino felt they had no option other than to sell land to the Crown; and
    
    *   (d) between 1873 and 1900, 82 000 acres of Ngāti Mākino land was alienated. Only 3.6% of the Waitahanui, Tāhunaroa and Whakarewa blocks remained in Ngāti Mākino hands by the end of the nineteenth century; and
    
    *   (e) accordingly, the Crown failed to protect actively the interests of Ngāti Mākino in the land it wished to retain. This was a breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi][172] and its principles.
    
    (9) The Crown acknowledges that Ngāti Mākino experienced further land loss during the twentieth century through purchases by private parties, and takings by the Crown for public works, including a parcel taken for railway purposes that cut the Ōtamarākau marae off from the sea.
    
    (10) The Crown acknowledges that it compulsorily acquired Ngāti Mākino land to establish scenic reserves. In this context, Ngāti Mākino were left little option but to gift land to the Crown if they were to have any control over which land was to be alienated and how that land was to be managed.
    
    (11) The Crown acknowledges that---
        
    *   (a) the cumulative effect of its actions rendered Ngāti Mākino virtually landless by 1900; and
    
    *   (b) Ngāti Mākino were therefore left with insufficient land to participate in, or benefit from, the development and consolidation schemes initiated from the 1920s; and
    
    *   (c) by 1992, only 0.6% of the Waitahanui, Tāhunaroa and Whakarewa blocks remained in Ngāti Mākino's hands; and

    (12) Through these acts, the Crown, its Ministers, and government departments have dishonoured the [Treaty of Waitangi][172], its principles, and its spirit, denigrating te mana motuhake o Ngāti Mākino. In so doing, the Crown acknowledges that it has brought dishonour upon itself.
    
    It now falls time for these grievances to be lifted.
    
    It is the desire of the Crown to build a foundation of trust and commitment, so that Ngāti Mākino and the Crown can work together to revitalise te rangatiratanga o Ngāti Mākino.
    
    Na ēnei mahinga kino a te Karauna, ōna Minita me ngā Tari Kāwanatanga kua takakinotia te [Tiriti o Waitangi][172], tōna Mauri, tōna Wairua me te mahi whakaiti i te mana motuhake o Ngāti Mākino. Na runga i tēna, e whakaae atu ana na te Karauna ano a ia i māteatea.
    
    Kua eke ki te wā kia hikitia ake i ēnei mamae.
    
    Ko tā te Karauna ko te hanga i te tūāpapa i runga i te pono, i te tika me te whakawhirinaki atu a tētahi ki tētahi kia mahitahi ai te Karauna me Ngāti Mākino i runga i te wairua o te kotahitanga, kia tutuki ai kia mana ai te rangatiratanga o Ngāti Mākino.
