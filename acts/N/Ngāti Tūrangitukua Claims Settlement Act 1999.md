An Act---
    
*   (a) to record the apology given by the Crown to Ngāti Tūrangitukua in the deed of settlement executed on 26 September 1998 by the Minister in Charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations, the Right Honourable Sir Douglas Arthur Montrose Graham, for the Crown, and Ngāti Tūrangitukua; and

*   (b) to give effect to certain provisions of that deed of settlement, being a deed that settles the Ngāti Tūrangitukua claims

*   #### Preamble
    
    ##### He kōrero tāhuhu
    
    A E mau ake nei te Rārangi Tāpiri Tuatahi mō tēnei ture, e whakaupoko ana i roto i te reo Māori me te reo Pākehā i ngā tikanga o [Te Tiriti o Waitangi][52].
    
    B Ko Ngāti Tūrangitukua he hapū nō te iwi o Ngāti Tūwharetoa, ā, i heke mai i tō rātou tipuna i a Tūrangitukua. Ko rātou te tangata whenua o te wāhi e tū nei te Tāone o Tūrangi, ā, nō rātou hoki te mana whenua mai rā anō ā mohoa nei.
    
    ###### Whakatakotohia ana e te Karauna tana Kaupapa Whanake Hiko i Tongariro
    
    C I te tekau tau i muri mai i te tau 1950, hei whakaea noa i te hiahia o muri mai i te Pakanga Tuarua o te Ao kia wawe tonu te whakawhānuitia o ngā rawa pūngao kia taea ai te whakatutuki te whakaahumahitanga o Aotearoa e hōrapa haere ana i taua wā rā, ka whakatakotohia e te Karauna tana kaupapa Whanake Hiko i Tongariro (""WHT""). E tutuki pai ai te WHT me nui tonu ngā kaimahi me te wāhi whakanoho i aua kaimahi ā tutuki noa te kaupapa.
    
    D E whā ngā wahi i whakaarotia ake hei tūnga mō te tāone e noho ai ngā kaimahi, arā, ko Rotoaira, ko Rangipō, ko Tūrangai-ki- te-uru me Tūrangi-ki-te-rāwhiti. I whakaarotia ake anō kia whakatūria he tāone taupua ki Rotoaira me Rangipō. Heoi anō ko tā te Karauna i pai kē ai ko te whakatū tāone pūmau kia puta anō ai he hua i tāna i whakapau ai kia tū ai taua tāone. Ko ngā wāhi i whakaarotia ake hei tūnga mō te tāone pūmau ko Tūrangi-ki-te-uru, e tū tata rā ki te tāone o Tūrangi o ēnei rā nei, ā, nō Ngāti Tūrangitukua nei taua whenua, tae atu hoki ki te whenua o te Karauna i Tūrangi-ki-te-rāwhiti.
    
    E Ko te hua e ahu mai ana i te Moana o Taupō i te hunga haere mai ki te torotoro, ki te mātakitaki hoki i te mōhiotia tae atu ki ngā hua ā-pūtea ka puta inā whakatūria he tāone pūmau mēnā rā ki te kitea he whenua kāore i te herea e te rīhi. I whakaarotia ake anōngā ara e māmā ai te tae atu o te tangata ki taua tāone, te āhua o ngā rangi, me te rawaka anō o te whenua kia taea ai tētahi tāone te whakatū, me te whakanui atu ā tōna wā. Ko tā te Karauna i pai ai ko te whenua i Tūrangi-ki-te-uru. I te marama o Hui-tanguru i te tau 1964 ka tīmata te Karauna i tāna mahi, arā, te riro atu o ngā whenua āhua nui tonu o Ngāti Tūrangitukua kāore nei i te herea e te rīhi (i a ia). Kāore i whakaarotia ake e te Karauna ngā āhuatanga kikino ka pā ki a Ngāti Tūrangitukua i te rironga kau noa o ō rātou whenua.
    
    ###### Ka hui te Karauna ki a Ngāti Tūrangitukua
    
    F I mua atu i tēnei i hui te Karauna ki ētahi o ngā mema o Te Poari Kaitiaki Māori o Tūwharetoa me ētahi o te iwi o Ngāti Tūrangitukua ki te whakamārama i te āhua o te WHT ki a rātou me te riro anō pea i a rātou o ētahi o ngā whenua o Ngāti Tūrangitukua i Tūrangi-ki-te-uru. I te marama o Mahuru i te tau 1964 ko te hui tuatahi a te Karauna ki te katoa o Ngāti Tūrangitukua ki te whiriwhiri i te whānui o te kaupapa e pā ana ki te WHT me te nui o te whenua e hiahiatia ana hei whakatū i te tāone. I taua hui rā i whakaae a Ngāti Tūrangitukua, hei tōna wā anō nei āta whakamanatia ai, kia whakatūria te tāone ki runga i ngā whenua o Ngāti Tūrangitukua. Heoi anō i a Ngāti Tūrangitukua e whakaae atu rā i te whakapono rātou ki ngā kupu taurangi atu a te Karauna mō te āhua o te riro atu o te whenua hei tūnga mō te tāone.
    
    ###### Ka tīmata ngā mahi
    
    G I muri tonu mai o taua hui o Mahuru rā ka tīmata ngā mahi e pā ana ki te WHT tae atu hoki ki te whakatūnga o te tāone. Inā kē noa atu te nui o te kaimahi i tau mai. Riro ana mā tēnei āhua e whakapōrearea te noho māori a Ngāti Tūrangitukua, ā, takahia ana te mana o ngā kaumātua o Ngāti Tūrangitukua e te Manatū Mahi. Haere ana ngā mahi a te Karauna, arā, te tango whenua, te whakatū hoki i te tāone; aro koretia ake ana ngā pānga mai o ēnei mahi ki a Ngāti Tūrangitukua me ngā kupu taurangi i puta i a ia, i te Karauna. Nui kē noa ake te whenua i riro i tērā i whakaritea i te tīmatanga, ā, i tohe te Karauna kia kaua aua whenua katoa e herea e te rīhi ahakoa āna kōrero o mua atu ko te wāhanga ahumahi o te tāone ka noho tonu hei whenua rīhi. Ukuukutia ana ngā wāhi tapu e te Karauna, ā, korekore ana i paku taea te aha e Ngāti Tūrangitukua, ngā kaitiaki o aua wāhi rā.
    
    ###### Hoko ana te Karauna i ngā rawa
    
    H Nō te tutukitanga o te kaupapa i ngā tau whakapaunga o te tekau tau atu i 1970 ka tīmata te Manatū Mahi me ētahi atu tari Kāwanatanga ki te hokohoko i ngā rawa o roto mai i te tāone o Tūrangi. Tae rawa mai ki tēnei whakatatūtanga i te take nei kāore a Ngāti Tūrangitukua me ōna whānau i whai wāhi atu ki te rironga mai anō o ō rātou whenua tīpuna.
    
    ###### Te tono i raro i te Ture Tiriti o Waitangi, 1975
    
    I Ko te tono a Ngāti Tūrangitukua, i rēhitatia nei ki te Taraipiunaro o Waitangi i te tau 1989 i raro i te tau Wai 84, kia takoto he utu mō ngā mahi kino i noho nei ko rātou te papa. Wawe tonu ana te whakahaeretia o te take i waenganui i ngā marama o Paenga-whāwhā me Whiringa-ā-nuku o te tau 1984, ā, i puta te Pūrongo a te Taraipiunara i te marama o Mahuru o te tau 1995\.
    
    ###### Ngā whakataunga a te Taraipiunara o Waitangi
    
    J I whakatau te Taraipiunara he nui tonu ngā takatakahitanga a te Karauna i ngā mātāpono o [te Tiriti o Waitangi][52]---
        
    *   (i) i riro i te Karauna tētahi whenua Māori i Tūrangi-ki-te-uru i te wā he whenua tonu tō te Karauna i Tūrangi-ki-te-rāwhiti:
    
    *   (ii) kāore i rawaka ngā huihuinga a te Karauna ki a Ngāti Tūrangitukua mō te āhua ki te whakatūnga o te tāone:
    
    *   (iii) ko te whenua i riro hei tūnga mō te tāone i neke atu te nui i tērā i oatitia e te Karauna ka riro i a ia:
    
    *   (iv) ko te whenua i whakaae te Karauna ka rīhitia mōngā āhuatanga ahumahi, ā, ka whakahokia mai ki te iwi i te ekenga o te 10--12 tau i āta tangohia kēhia atu, kore rawa nei i whakahokia mai:
    
    *   (v) ukuukutia ana, tūkinotia ana ngā wāhi tapu i te wā i whakatūria ai te tāone:
    
    *   (vi) kāore i rawaka te utu mō ngā whenua i riro:
    
    *   (vii) kore rawa atu te Karauna i aro ake ki te taha tiaki i te taiao:
    
    *   (viii) kāore i kauanuanutia e te Karauna te mana tangata whenua o Ngāti Tūrangitukua:
    
    *   (ix) ko ngā whakarite o roto i te Ture Mahi Tūmatanui 1928 me te Ture Tāone o Tūrangi 1964, i waiho nei e te Karauna hei tautoko i tā rātou urutomo, tango kau noa i te whenua o Ngāti Tūrangitukua kei te noho taupatupatu ki te Ture II o te Tiriti e kī rā e āhei ana te Māori ki te pupuri i ōna whenua ā eke noa ki te wā e hiahia ai ia ki te hoko.
    
    K Ko te whakatau a te Taraipiunara nā ngā mahi takatakahi a te Karauna i ngā mātāpono o te Tiriti he nui tonu ngā whenua tipuna o Ngāti Tūrangitukua i ngaro atu. Noho ana ko te tūāpapa ohaoha, iwi anō hoki hei papa mō tēnei mahi, ā, me te aha anō mate ana ko te taha wairua, taha tikanga, taha ohaoha o Ngāti Tūrangitukua.
    
    ###### Te whakahaerenga o te take kimi rongoā
    
    L Nō muri i te putanga o te pūrongo a te Taraipiunara ka noho te Karauna rāua ko Ngāti Tūrangitukua ki te whiriwhiri, ki te kimi rongoā anō hoki mō ngā mate i pā ki a Ngāti Tūrangitukua.
    
    M Ko ngā whiriwhiritanga i waenganui i te Karauna me Ngāti Tūrangitukua i mutu noa iho ki te takiwā i te marama o Pipiri i te tau 1996\. I te marama o Hōngongoi i te tau 1996, i whakaaetia a Ngāti Tūrangitukua kia whakahaeretia tana take kimi rongoā ki mua i te aroaro o te Taraipiunara o Waitangi kia āta whakatauhia ai me tino aha ngā āhuatanga whakatatū mō roto o Wai 84, tae atu ki te whakahokinga mai o ngā whenua me ngā whakapainga i aua whenua i runga anō i tā te [Tekiona 27B][53] te Ture Hinonga Kāwanatanga i kī ai. Ko te whakahaeretanga o tēnei take i tū ki te marae o Hīrangi i te marama o Hōngongoi o te tau 1997\.
    
    ###### Ngā whiriwhiritanga i waenganui i a Ngāti Tūrangitukua me te Karauna
    
    N Nō muri mai i te putanga o te pūrongo a te Taraipiunara o Waitangi e kiia nei ko Te Pūrongo Kimi Rongoā e Pā Ana ki te Tāone o Tūrangi i te marama o Hōngongoi o te tau 1998, ka noho anō te Karauna rāua ko Ngāti Tūrangitukua ki te kimi, ki te whakaae i tētahi whakatatūtanga whakamutunga o ngā tono a Ngāti Tūrangitukua, ā, ki te whakakore anō hoki i te mamae e pā tonu ana ki a Ngāti Tūrangitukua.
    
    ###### Te whakatatūtanga o ngā tono
    
    O Ko te Karauna, i runga anō i tana whakaae he nui ngā mate i pā ki a Ngāti Tūrangitukua, ā, takea mai ana i reira te ngoi kore haere o te taha ohaoha, taha iwi, taha tikanga o Ngāti Tūrangitukua, i whakaotia tētahi Puka Whakatatū, i te 26 o ngā rā o Mahuru 1998, ā, ki reira takoto mai ai ngā āhuatanga katoa e taea ai ngā tono katoa a Ngāti Tūrangitukua te whakatatū, te whakaae mō ake tonu atu, ā, e pēnei ana anō hoki te hiahia o Ngāti Tūrangitukua.
    
    ##### Background in English
    
    A The [Treaty of Waitangi][52] is set out, in Māori and English, in [Schedule 1][49].
    
    B Ngāti Tūrangitukua, a hapū of the tribe Ngāti Tūwharetoa, are descended from their tūpuna, Tūrangitukua. They are the tangata whenua of the area now comprised in the Turangi Township, and have had the mana whenua of that land since time immemorial.
    
    ###### The Crown develops the TPD proposal
    
    C In the 1950s, in response to post World War II needs for rapid expansion of energy resources to meet the growing industrialisation in New Zealand, the Crown developed the Tongariro Power Development (""TPD"") proposal. At that time, it was the largest hydro development to be undertaken in New Zealand. The TPD would require a large construction force, and accommodation for that force, for the duration of the project.
    
    D Four sites were considered for the township to accommodate the project workers: Rotoaira, Rangipo, Turangi West, and Turangi East. Temporary townships were considered at the sites of Rotoaira and Rangipo. However, the Crown favoured the provision of a permanent township which would ensure a return on its investment. Sites for a permanent township were considered at Turangi West, adjacent to the existing Turangi village and owned by Ngāti Tūrangitukua, as well as Crown-owned land at Turangi East.
    
    E The tourist potential of Lake Taupo was appreciated, as well as the economic benefits that could be captured by creating a permanent township, if a suitable freehold site were available. Having regard to accessibility, climate, and adequacy of suitable land for development of a township, the Crown preferred the Turangi West site. In February 1964, the Crown began the process which was to see the acquisition of the freehold interest in a significant portion of Ngāti Tūrangitukua's ancestral land. It did not take into account the negative effects for Ngāti Tūrangitukua of compulsorily acquiring its land.
    
    ###### The Crown meets Ngāti Tūrangitukua
    
    F At an earlier stage, the Crown had met with members of the Tuwharetoa Maori Trust Board and some members of Ngāti Tūrangitukua to advise them of the nature of the TPD project and to discuss the possibility of acquiring land owned by Ngāti Tūrangitukua at the Turangi West site. In September 1964, the Crown met with Ngāti Tūrangitukua as a whole for the first time to discuss the scope of the TPD including the land required for the township. Ngāti Tūrangitukua there agreed in principle that the township be constructed on Ngāti Tūrangitukua land. However, in so agreeing, Ngāti Tūrangitukua relied on various assurances and undertakings given to it by the Crown as to the acquisition of land for the township.
    
    ###### Construction begins
    
    G The construction of the TPD and the township began almost immediately after the September meeting. There was a large influx of construction workers. This disrupted the traditional lifestyles of Ngāti Tūrangitukua people, and the Ministry of Works undermined the authority of Ngāti Tūrangitukua kaumātua. The Crown had proceeded to acquire land and develop the township without proper regard for the interests of Ngāti Tūrangitukua or for the assurances and undertakings given to it by the Crown. Considerably more land was acquired than had originally been outlined, and the Crown insisted on acquiring the freehold of all the land, notwithstanding earlier statements that the industrial area of the town would be leased. Wāhi tapu were destroyed by the Crown, and the people of Ngāti Tūrangitukua, their kaitiaki, were powerless to protect them.
    
    ###### The Crown sells assets
    
    H Following the completion of the project in the late 1970s, the Ministry of Works and other government departments began a process of selling assets within the Turangi township. Until the present settlement, Ngāti Tūrangitukua and its constituent whānau were effectively denied the opportunity to regain ownership of their ancestral lands.
    
    ###### Claim under the Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975
    
    I The Ngāti Tūrangitukua claim, registered with the Waitangi Tribunal as Wai 84 in 1989, sought compensation for these grievances. The claim was heard under urgency between April and October 1994, and the Tribunal's Report was released in September 1995\.
    
    ###### Findings of the Waitangi Tribunal
    
    J The Tribunal found that the Crown had breached the principles of the [Treaty of Waitangi][52] in a number of ways---
        
    *   (i) the Crown acquired Māori land at Turangi West when Crown land at Turangi East was available:
    
    *   (ii) the Crown did not adequately consult with Ngāti Tūrangitukua regarding the construction of the township:
    
    *   (iii) the land taken for the township was in excess of the maximum area that the Crown promised it would take:
    
    *   (iv) the land the Crown undertook to lease for industrial purposes and return to the people after 10 to 12 years was compulsorily acquired and not returned:
    
    *   (v) wāhi tapu were destroyed or damaged in the construction of the township:
    
    *   (vi) adequate compensation was not paid for land acquired:
    
    *   (vii) the Crown did not give full effect to conservation values:
    
    *   (viii) the Crown did not pay Ngāti Tūrangitukua the respect due its mana as tangata whenua:
    
    *   (ix) the provisions of the Public Works Act 1928 and the Turangi Township Act 1964, relied on by the Crown in entering and taking the claimants' land, are inconsistent with the basic guarantee in Article 2 of the Treaty that Māori may keep their land until such time as they wish to sell it.
    
    K The Tribunal found that, as a result of the Crown's breaches of the principles of the Treaty, Ngāti Tūrangitukua lost much of its ancestral land. Its social and economic base was seriously eroded causing spiritual, cultural, and economic prejudice to Ngāti Tūrangitukua.
    
    ###### The remedies hearing
    
    L Following the release of the Tribunal report, the Crown and Ngāti Tūrangitukua entered into negotiations to seek resolution of Ngāti Tūrangitukua's grievances.
    
    M Negotiations between the Crown and Ngāti Tūrangitukua broke down in June 1996\. In July 1996, Ngāti Tūrangitukua was granted a remedies hearing before the Waitangi Tribunal to identify with more specificity the contents of any settlement package for Wai 84, including the resumption of properties subject to [section 27B][53] of the State-Owned Enterprises Act 1986\. That hearing was held at Hirangi Marae in July 1997\.
    
    ###### Negotiations between Ngāti Tūrangitukua and the Crown
    
    N Following the release of the Waitangi Tribunal's Turangi Township Remedies Report in July 1998, the Crown and Ngāti Tūrangitukua again negotiated to achieve a full and final settlement of Ngāti Tūrangitukua's Treaty claims and to remove the continuing sense of grievance.
    
    ###### Settlement of claims
    
    O The Crown, having acknowledged that Ngāti Tūrangitukua suffered injustices which impaired Ngāti Tūrangitukua's economic, social, and cultural development, entered into a deed of settlement on 26 September 1998 recording the matters required to give effect to a full and final settlement of Ngāti Tūrangitukua's Treaty claims relating to the development and construction of the Turangi Township and its after-effects, and Ngāti Tūrangitukua also entered into that deed of settlement.

##### 1 Short Title and commencement
    
*   (1) This Act may be cited as the Ngāti Tūrangitukua Claims Settlement Act 1999\.
    
    (2) This Act comes into force on the day after the date on which it receives the Royal assent.

##### 2 Act to bind the Crown
    
*   This Act binds the Crown.

## Part 1  
Apology by the Crown to Ngāti Tūrangitukua

##### 3 Apology
    
*   This Part records the apology given by the Crown to Ngāti Tūrangitukua in the deed of settlement.

##### 4 Text in Māori
    
*   The text of the apology in Māori is as follows:
    
    > *   "1 E whakaae ana te Karauna mō te āhua ki te whakatūnga o te tāone o Tūrangi kāore ia i ū ki ngā mātāpono o [te Tiriti o Waitangi][52] i roto i āna mahi ki a Ngāti Tūrangitukua. Nā te āhua i waenganui i ngā iwi e rua i haina nei i te Tiriti e tika ana te Karauna kia aronui ki ngā hiahia o te Māori, ā, e kī ana te Karauna i hē ia he kore nōna i aronui atu ki ngā hiahia o te hapū.
    > 
    > *   "2 E whakaae ana te Karauna kāore ia i āta whiriwhiri, i rawaka rānei āna whiriwhiritanga ki a Ngāti Tūrangitukua i te katoa o te wā e whakatūria ana te tāone o Tūrangi i muri mai hoki i tērā, ā, e kī ana a ia nā tēnei hē ōna kāore i aronuitia, kāore hoki i kauanuanutia a Ngāti Tūrangitukua me tōna mana tangata whenua tae atu hoki ki ngā kaumātua me ō rātou nā mana.
    > 
    > *   "3 E whakaae ana te Karauna nā te mea nō Ngāti Tūrangitukua te whenua e tika ana kia manaakitia rātou i raro anō i te Tiriti, ā, nā te mea i whakapono rātou ki ngā kupu taurangi atu a te Karauna ka whakaae atu a Ngāti Tūrangitukua ki te whakawātea i tō rātou whenua i Tūrangi hei wāhi tūnga mō te tāone, ā, nā te korenga o te Karauna i ū ki tāna i kī ai kāore i whāia ngā mātāpono o te Tiriti.
    > 
    > *   "4 E tino pāpōuri ana te ngākau o te Karauna mō tāna i mahi ai ki te katoa o Ngāti Tūrangitukua i te wā o te whakatūnga o te tāone, ā, i muri mai i tērā kāore te Karauna i āta tiaki i ngā wāhi tapu, ā, noho ana ko te taha wairua me te taha tikanga o Ngāti Tūrangitukua hei papa.
    > 
    > *   "5 E tino pāpōuri ana te Karauna mō āna mahi hē i mahi ai, nā reira e whakaae nei ki te whakatatūtanga o ngā tono kua roa nei e takoto ana a Ngāti Tūrangitukua e rārangi mai nei i te Whakatatūtanga i hainahia nei i te 26 o ngā rā o Mahuru 1998\."
    > 
    > 
    
    

##### 5 Text in English
    
*   The text of the apology in English is as follows:
    
    > *   "1 The Crown acknowledges that, in relation to the construction of the Turangi township, it failed to act towards Ngāti Tūrangitukua in a manner consistent with the principles of the [Treaty of Waitangi][52].

    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
