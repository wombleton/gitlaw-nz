    WHEREAS The New Zealand Institute for the Blind (hereinafter called the Institute), a separate institution under the Hospitals and Charitable Institutions Act 1926, owns and conducts an institution in the City of Auckland for the care and assistance of blind persons: And whereas it has heretofore been doubtful whether the lands and buildings used for such purposes were exempt from rating and the Institute has not been paying rates thereon save only rates levied or charged in connection with water supplied by the Auckland City Council (hereinafter called the Council) for and in respect of the said lands and buildings: And whereas the Council has now been advised that the said lands and buildings rateable and it is desirable to expressly exempt the said lands and buildings from all rates (save only rates levied or charged in connection with water supplied to the Institute for or in respect of the said lands and buildings) and to make such exemption retrospective:
