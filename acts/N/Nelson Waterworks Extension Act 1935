*   (1) If at any time during or after the construction of any works authorized by this Act any damage attributable to any such works is caused to any water-supply works owned by the Crown, or if, in the opinion of the Minister of Works and Development, it becomes necessary or expedient, in consequence of any works undertaken by the Council, to carry out any work for the protection of any water-supply works owned by the Crown, the Council shall forthwith, after receiving notice from the said Minister, proceed to remedy the damage to his satisfaction or to carry out any such protective works as he directs.

    (2) In the event of the supply of water to the Stoke Mental Hospital being at any time reduced or cut off through damage to any water-supply works owned by the Crown, or by seepage due to the driving of any tunnel or the construction of other works by the Council, or through any other cause whatever that is attributable to the Council's work, then and in any such case the Council shall forthwith supply to the reservoir of the Stoke Mental Hospital, without charge, such quantity of potable water as will make a flow of one hundred and thirty thousand gallons per diem available if required for the purposes of the said hospital.
    
    (3) For the purpose of giving effect to the last preceding subsection, the Council forthwith, after the construction of any intake dam and pipe-line authorized by this Act, shall connect the pipe-line with the reservoir of the Stoke Mental Hospital by means of a pipe-line capable of supplying the quantity of water specified in the last preceding subsection.
    
    (4) Subsections [two][5] and [three][5] of this section shall apply and take effect only in the event of the construction by the Council of a tunnel of which some part is within a distance of one hundred and twenty chains from the intake dam of the Stoke Mental Hospital, which dam is shown on the said plan marked PWD 88305, and is marked ""A"" on the said plan.
    
    (5) \[Repealed\]
