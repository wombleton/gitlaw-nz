    *   (b) efficiency, in that the allocation of costs should generally aim at the provision of maximum services at minimum cost:
    
    *   (c) justifiability, in that costs should generally be recovered to meet only the actual and reasonable costs of the provision of services:
    
    *   (d) transparency, in that---
            
        *   (i) both budget projections and actual costs should generally be transparent; and
        
        *   (ii) costs should generally be identified for, and allocated as closely as practicable to, tangible service provision in the recovery period in which the service is provided:
        
        
    
    *   (e) ease of administration, in that the costs of collection should generally be kept as low as possible:
    
    *   (f) flexibility, in that the method of recovering costs should generally be able to---
            
        *   (i) adapt to changes in species or sub-groups of species covered by the Act; and
        
        *   (ii) cope with variations in costs to be recovered; and
        
        *   (iii) encourage the provision of complete and accurate data.
        
        
    
    

##### 59 Methods

    *   (g) fees or charges consisting of the actual and reasonable costs of providing a service:
    
    *   (h) fees or charges based on estimated costs and paid before the provision of the service, followed by reconciliation and an appropriate further payment or refund after the provision of the service:
    
    *   (i) refundable or non-refundable deposits paid before the provision of the service:
    
    *   (j) fees or charges that differ depending on whether or not a special or an urgent service is provided:
    
    *   (k) fees or charges that include more than 1 level of fee or charge for the same service provided in different ways, or provided in or for different places:
    
    *   (l) fees or charges that differ for otherwise similar services provided in different ways:
    
    *   (m) fees or charges that differ depending on the amount of service required or the components of the service required for the particular person or class of persons:
    
    *   (n) fees or charges imposed on all users of services, classes of users of services, all beneficiaries of services, or classes of beneficiaries of services:
