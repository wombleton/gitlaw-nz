    WHEREAS the Napier Harbour Board (hereinafter referred to as the Board) is the owner of the area of land described in the Schedule hereto, which area adjoins the Borough of Napier and lies at the approach into the said borough from the Napier-Taradale Road: And whereas the said area consists in large part of a backwater from the sea into which the main storm-water drain of the Borough of Napier discharges, and constitutes an unsightly and malodorous approach to the Town of Napier: And whereas the filling-in, reclamation, and levelling of the said area, and the extension of the said main storm-water drain through the same, would be beneficial both to the Board and to the Borough of Napier: And whereas the Mayor, Councillors, and Burgesses of the Borough of Napier (hereinafter referred to as the Corporation) are desirous of acquiring the said area, and the Board is desirous of selling the same to the Corporation for the considerations and in manner by this Act provided:

BE IT THEREFORE ENACTED by the General Assembly of New Zealand in Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:---

The costs of the reference and award shall be borne and paid by the parties to the reference in equal proportions.
