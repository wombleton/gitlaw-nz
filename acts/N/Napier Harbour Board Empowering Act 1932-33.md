    WHEREAS it is expedient that the Napier Harbour Board (hereinafter referred to as the Board) should have power to sell certain areas of land in order to provide funds to improve and render saleable those areas and to render revenue-producing certain other areas of land: And whereas the earthquake which occurred in Hawke's Bay on the third day of February, nineteen hundred and thirty-one, had the effect of raising the level of the bottom of the Ahuriri Lagoon (being an endowment reserved and set aside for the use, benefit, and endowment of, and vested in, the Board by the Napier Harbour Board Act 1874, as amended by the [Napier Harbour Board Amendment and Endowment Improvement Act 1887][11], which last-mentioned Act is hereinafter referred to as the 1887 Act), thereby reclaiming from the sea large areas of the said lagoon, and confusing the boundaries, both external and internal, thereof: And whereas the description of the Ahuriri Lagoon as set out in Schedule [2][12] to the 1887 Act excludes certain islands lying within the outside boundaries of the lagoon, called therein Roro-o-kuri, Parapara, Te Ihuotikei, Uruwiri, Poroporo, Tirowhangahe, Tuteranuku, Awa-a-waka, and Matawhero respectively, of which all except Roro-o-kuri (now owned by Europeans) and Te Ihuotikei and Parapara (both now owned by the Napier Borough Council, the Hastings Borough Council, and the Hawke's Bay County Council) are Native land the title to which has never been investigated, ascertained, or determined: And whereas it is expedient in the interests of the Board that the Board should be afforded the facilities and possess the powers by this Act given and conferred in relation to the Ahuriri Lagoon and the islands lying within the outside boundaries thereof as aforesaid:

##### 4 Power to sell certain land
    
*   The Board shall have power to sell by public auction or public tender, in such parcels, upon such terms and conditions as to payment of the purchase-price, security for unpaid purchase-moneys, and otherwise, as it shall think fit, portions, limited as hereinafter provided, of the said area of twenty-eight acres, and of the said area of ninety-two acres, and to apply the purchase-moneys arising from any such sale, in or towards the costs and expenses of surveying, subdividing, levelling, roading, draining, and otherwise improving and rendering revenue-producing the said area of twenty-eight acres and the said area of ninety-two acres, or either of them, including the costs and expenses appertaining to the rendering saleable to the best advantage of the portions of the said areas respectively to which the power of sale hereby conferred shall apply:
    
    Provided always and it is hereby declared as follows:---
        
    *   (a) The power of sale hereby conferred upon the Board shall not apply to more than one-third of the total area, exclusive of roads, of each of the said areas of twenty-eight acres and ninety-two acres respectively; but no purchaser from the Board shall be concerned to see or inquire as to whether the Board has exceeded the limit aforesaid, nor shall his title be invalidated or impeached by reason of the Board having exceeded such limit, nor shall he be bound to see or inquire as to the application of his purchase-moneys, or be responsible for the misapplication thereof; and a recital in any instrument of alienation executed by the Board in favour of a purchaser that such instrument is entered into under the authority of this Act shall be conclusive evidence for the purposes of such instrument that the Board is acting within the limits of the authority hereby conferred.
    
    *   (b) If the Board shall offer any of the lands to which this section applies for sale by public auction or public tender it shall publish in some newspaper circulating in the towns of Napier and Hastings once at least not less than thirty days before the day appointed for the auction, or before the last day appointed for making a tender, as the case may be, and twice at least after such first publication and before the day so appointed, a notice setting out sufficient particulars of the land proposed to be offered for sale, and of the terms for payment of the purchase-moneys.
    
    *   (c) It shall not be necessary in any such sale by public auction or public tender for the Board to accept the highest or any bid or tender.
    
    *   (d) Notwithstanding anything in this section, land that has been offered for sale as aforesaid and not sold may at any time within twelve months after the day of the auction, or after the last day for the delivery of tenders for the same, as the case may be, be sold by private contract at a price not less than the upset price at which the land was so offered, and upon terms and conditions as to payment of the purchase-price, security for unpaid purchase-moneys, and otherwise, coinciding with the original terms and conditions in these respects, or differing therefrom, as the Board shall decide. Provided always that nothing shall prevent the Board from again offering the said land for sale by public auction or public tender in manner hereinbefore provided before the expiration of the said period of twelve months conditionally on such offer not being made at an earlier date than three months after the last preceding abortive attempt to effect a sale in that way, and these provisions shall continue to apply notwithstanding any previous abortive attempts to sell by public auction or public tender.
    
    *   (e) If there shall be any surplus moneys arising from sales of land hereby authorized after completion of the purposes for which the power of sale is hereby conferred upon the Board, the same may be applied by the Board in or towards payment of purchase-moneys, compensation, costs, charges, and expenses incurred in, or incidental to, the carrying-out of the powers hereinafter conferred upon the Board in relation to the Ahuriri Lagoon; and if there shall still be an ultimate surplus the same shall be applied by the Board in or towards payment of the principal moneys owing by the Board in respect of any loan obtained on the security of, _inter alia_, the said area of twenty-eight acres and the said area of ninety-two acres under the authority of the [Napier Harbour Board Amendment and Endowment Improvement Act 1912][13].
    
    *   (f) Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to deprive the Board of any powers it may possess as a leasing authority under the [Public Bodies Leases Act 1969][14], in respect of the whole or any part of the said area of twenty-eight acres, and the said area of ninety-two acres respectively.

    The reference to the Public Works Act 1981 in paragraph (d) was substituted, as from 1 February 1982, for a reference to the Public Works Act 1928 pursuant to section [248(1)][17] Public Works Act 1981 (1981 No 35).
