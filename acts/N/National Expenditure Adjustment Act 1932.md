    (3) For the purposes of this Part of this Act any sum paid or payable under any contract to which this Part of this Act applies by way of premium, or bonus, or other like payment, shall be deemed to be interest or rent as the case may require, accruing from day to day throughout the term of the contract.
    
    (4) The Governor-General may at any time, by Order in Council published in the _Gazette_, exclude from the operation of this Part of this Act any specified class or specified classes of mortgages or other contracts.

##### 30 Limitation of application of this Part
    
*   Nothing in this Part of this Act shall apply with respect to---
        
    *   (a) The rate of interest payable under any mortgage (not being a mortgage for a fixed term, whether expired or unexpired) securing the repayment of any principal money that is repayable on demand, or to the rate of interest payable under any mortgage debenture or other charge secured exclusively on any such mortgage or mortgages; or

    *   (b) In the case of a contract entered into at any time earlier than 5 years before the 1st day of January 1930, or at any time after that date, the standard reduction shall be 20 percent of the rate (to be determined in accordance with the next succeeding subsection) that would have been fixed by the contract if it had been entered into on the said 1st day of January 1930\.
    
    (2) Where for the purposes of this Part of this Act it is necessary to fix the rate of interest or rent that would have been payable under any contract if such contract had been entered into on the 1st day of January 1930, such rate may, failing agreement by the parties, be fixed by arbitration if the parties agree to submit the matter to arbitration. If such rate is not fixed by agreement of the parties or by arbitration as aforesaid, it shall, on application by motion by either of the parties, be fixed by the High Court if the annual amount of interest or rent payable in accordance with the terms of the contract exceeds $600 and in all other cases shall be fixed by a District Court Judge.
    
    (3) If the rate of interest or rent as at the 31st day of March 1932, payable under any contract to which this Part of this Act applies, does not exceed the residue of the rate in respect of which the standard reduction has been computed, after such standard reduction has been made, no reduction of interest or rent shall require to be made under this Part of this Act.
    
    (4) If the rate of interest or rent as at the 31st day of March 1932, payable under any contract to which this Part of this Act applies, exceeds the residue of the rate in respect of which the standard reduction has been computed, after such standard reduction has been made, the reduction required to be made under this Part of this Act shall be the difference between such rate and the residue aforesaid, but not exceeding in any case a reduction of 20 percent of the rate as at the 31st day of March 1932\.

    (3) Where a mortgage comprises both chattels and land or other property, an apportionment of the money secured thereby shall, if necessary for the purposes of this section, be made by agreement between the parties thereto, and in default of agreement may be made by a District Court Judge on application in that behalf by any of the parties thereto.
