##### 1 Short Title

##### 2 Incorporation of New Zealand Library Association
    
*   (1) The society heretofore known as the New Zealand Library Association (hereinafter referred to as the _Association_) is hereby constituted a body corporate by the name of the New Zealand Library Association (Incorporated), having perpetual succession and a common seal, and being capable of holding real and personal property and of doing and suffering all that bodies corporate may do and suffer.
    
    (2) The society referred to in the last preceding subsection is the society originally constituted as the Libraries Association of New Zealand at a meeting of representatives of public libraries that was held in Dunedin in March 1910, pursuant to a resolution adopted by the Dunedin City Council on 7 February 1910\.

##### 3 Application to Association of certain provisions of Incorporated Societies Act 1908
    
*   [Sections 13 to 18][10] and [section 20][11] of the Incorporated Societies Act 1908 shall apply with respect to the Association as if it were a society incorporated under that Act.

##### 4 Rules of Association to be amended
    
*   (1) As soon as conveniently may be after the passing of this Act, the rules of the Association shall be amended so as to make provision for such additional matters as would have to be provided for in its rules if the Association were a society incorporated under the [Incorporated Societies Act 1908][12].
    
    (2) Nothing in the last preceding subsection shall preclude the revocation of the existing rules and the making of new rules in substitution therefor.
    
    (3) The Association may make provision in its rules for any matter in respect of which it could make rules if it were incorporated under the [Incorporated Societies Act 1908][12].
    
    (4) The adoption of new rules by the Association shall not affect its corporate identity.

##### 5 Local authorities may become members of Association
    
*   (1) Any local authority that has established or has power to establish a public library may be admitted to and become a member of the Association in the name and on behalf of the corporation represented by it.
    
    (2) Any local authority, being a member of the Association as aforesaid, may pay any subscriptions, dues, or other moneys payable by it to the Association (including donations to the funds of the Association) out of any of its moneys available for library purposes.

##### 6 Corporate bodies may become members of Association
    
*   Any corporate body, whether incorporated under the [Incorporated Societies Act 1908][12] or in any other manner, may be admitted to and become a member of the Association, unless the objects of the Association, as defined in its rules, are _ultra vires_ of such corporate body.

##### 7 Exercise of rights of membership by corporate and unincorporated bodies
    
*   The rules of the Association may define the rights of membership of any corporate or unincorporated bodies, being members of the Association, and may prescribe the manner in which such rights may be exercised.

##### 8 Winding up of Association
    
*   The Association shall not be wound up except by leave of the Governor-General in Council.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the New Zealand Library Association Act 1939\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 30 September 1939, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][13] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][14] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][15] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][16] and [17E][17] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
