*   #### Preamble
    
    (1) The [Treaty of Waitangi][180], as set out in English and in Maori in Schedule 1 of the Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975, was signed in 1840:
    
    (2) Recitals (3) to (15) of this Preamble present, in summary form, the background to the Ngati Ruanui historical claims that is set out in Part 6 of the deed of settlement entered into by Ngati Ruanui and the Crown:
    
    ###### Pre-1860
    
    (3) Ngati Ruanui were prosperous and economically successful in the 1840s and 1850s, and traded extensively with European settlements and overseas traders. Following the signing of the [Treaty of Waitangi][180], Ngati Ruanui consistently opposed the sale of Maori land in Taranaki. By the mid-1860s, Ngati Ruanui and other iwi of Taranaki and elsewhere had entered into a compact to oppose further land sales. By 1860, no Ngati Ruanui land had been sold to the Crown:
    
    ###### Taranaki wars
    
    (4) In 1860, Ngati Ruanui continued to support the people of Te Atiawa and Nga Rauru who opposed land sale, specifically with respect to the Pekapeka and Waitotara blocks. The Crown proclaimed martial law throughout Taranaki on 22 February 1860 in response to Maori opposition to the Crown's attempts to acquire the Pekapeka block at Waitara. The Taranaki wars of 1860--61 and 1863--69 followed. Ngati Ruanui suffered much loss of life and property during these wars:
    
    (5) At the end of the war in 1869, some 233 Pakakohi men, women, and children of Ngati Ruanui surrendered, following promises that they would not be killed. Many of these people were tried for treason, and 74 were subsequently sentenced to death. These sentences were commuted to terms of imprisonment of 3 and 7 years. The prisoners were sent to South Island jails. At least 18 of the 74 imprisoned died before release. The remaining prisoners were released in 1872\. Following their release, the Government would not permit them to return to their previous homes:
    
    ###### Confiscation
    
    (6) In 1863, the New Zealand Settlements Act 1863 was enacted. This Act was used to effect the confiscation of lands of Maori whom the Crown assessed to have been engaged in ""rebellion"" against the authority of the Queen. It was under this Act that, in 1865, the Governor of New Zealand confiscated much of the land of Ngati Ruanui. The confiscation proclamation of 2 September 1865 declared all of southern Taranaki an ""eligible site"", liable to be used for the purposes of European settlement:
    
    ###### Compensation Court
    
    (7) A Compensation Court was set up under the New Zealand Settlements Act 1863 to compensate some of those whose land was confiscated by the Crown. Maori who, for the purposes of the New Zealand Settlements Act 1863, had been found to be in arms against the Crown since 1 January 1863, or to have supported those found to be in arms, could not receive compensation. Claimants had to establish both that they had an interest in the land and that they had been loyal to the Crown. Almost all of the resident claimants within the rohe of Ngati Ruanui were rejected for one reason or another. Only 40 people out of 997 were assessed to be resident loyals and awarded a full share of the entitlement assessed by the Compensation Court for the middle section of the Ngati Ruanui Coast District. None of the awards was properly implemented and by 1880, when the West Coast Commission began its investigations, none of the people of Ngati Ruanui had received grants for the land:
    
    ###### Late purchases
    
    (8) In the period 1874--81, the Crown claimed to acquire Ngati Ruanui lands situated both outside and inside the confiscation area by means of purchase effected through deeds of cession. In purchasing this land, the Crown did not properly investigate the customary title. Purchases both inside and outside the confiscation boundary were further flawed in that negotiations were not conducted openly, minimal consideration was paid, and very few reserves were promised. Of those reserves that were promised, none had been created by 1880, leaving Ngati Ruanui with very limited land for their support and maintenance:
    
    ###### Parihaka
    
    (9) Following the Taranaki wars, a number of Ngati Ruanui people joined the passive resistance settlement of Parihaka, which had been established before the Taranaki wars ended and, which was under the leadership of Tohu Kakahi and Te Whiti o Rongomai. This settlement was established on land in central Taranaki, the confiscation of which was widely perceived as having been abandoned. The passive resistance campaigns included the removal of survey pegs and fencing, and the ploughing of settler land throughout Taranaki, and led to more than 636 people from throughout Taranaki being arrested and imprisoned. Few of these people received a trial, and special legislation was passed to first defer the remainder of the trials and to then dispense with them altogether. Many prisoners, including people of Ngati Ruanui, were held in prisons in the South Island where conditions were harsh and included hard labour:
    
    (10) In 1881, more than 1 500 Crown troops invaded and occupied the settlement of Parihaka. Over the following days, some 1 600 men, women, and children, not originally from Parihaka, were forcibly expelled from the settlement. Houses and cultivations in the vicinity were systematically destroyed, and stock was driven away or killed. Maori of Taranaki report that women were raped and otherwise molested by their attackers:
    
    (11) The leaders of Parihaka, Tohu Kakahi and Te Whiti o Rongomai, were arrested, and special legislation provided for their imprisonment without trial:
    
    ###### West Coast Commissions and the West Coast Settlement Reserves Act 1881
    
    (12) Two West Coast Commissions were appointed in 1880\. The first was established to inquire into the Compensation Court awards and specific promises made by the Crown to Maori in Taranaki concerning confiscated lands. The second was established to implement the recommendations of the first. The North and South of Taranaki had already been substantially settled by European settlers. This meant that land was not available for adequate reserves. A small amount of land was returned in South Taranaki. Most of Ngati Ruanui's productive coastal land was retained by the Crown, and they were left with insufficient agricultural land for their existence and future development:
    
    (13) Virtually all of the land that was returned was returned under individualised title, overriding the customary forms of land tenure and providing no protection against future alienation:
    
    (14) The reserves made by the West Coast Commission were vested in the Public Trustee in trust for Maori owners, so that Maori lost their legal ownership. The Public Trustee had full power to sell the alienable reserves and lease the inalienable ones under terms imposed by statute. A substantial proportion of the land was subsequently leased to settlers subject to perpetually renewable leases. This imposed system denied Ngati Ruanui control over their lands and control of the income from their lands:
    
    (15) In 1926, the Sim Commission was set up to investigate confiscations under the New Zealand Settlements Act 1863 and subsequent legislation. The Commission's recommendations for an annuity of £5,000 for all the Taranaki confiscations and a single payment of £300 for the loss of property at Parihaka were not discussed with the iwi concerned and were never accepted as adequate. The timing of the payment of the annuity was uncertain, and the sums due in the early 1930s were not fully paid:
    
    ###### Ngati Ruanui have long sought to have their grievances redressed
    
    (16) Taranaki Maori, including Ngati Ruanui, have longstanding claims against the Crown. Those claims have been expressed through petitions and protests made by Taranaki Maori, including Ngati Ruanui. Those petitions and protests contributed to the establishment, in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, of various commissions of inquiry into lands confiscated from Taranaki Maori:
    
    ###### Claims under the Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975
    
    (17) The enactment of the Treaty of Waitangi Amendment Act 1985 made it possible for Maori to bring claims before the Waitangi Tribunal in respect of acts or omissions on or after 6 February 1840 by, or on behalf of, the Crown that were inconsistent with the principles of the [Treaty of Waitangi][180]:
    
    (18) Between 1990 and 1995, the Waitangi Tribunal investigated 21 claims concerning Taranaki Maori, including Ngati Ruanui:
    
    ###### Interim views of the Waitangi Tribunal
    
    (19) The Crown acknowledged to the Waitangi Tribunal, in its interim response to the Taranaki claims, that---
        
    *   (a) the Waitara purchase and the wars constituted an injustice and were therefore in breach of the principles of the [Treaty of Waitangi][180]:
    
    *   (b) the confiscation of land, as it occurred in Taranaki, also constituted an injustice and was therefore in breach of the principles of the [Treaty of Waitangi][180]:
    
    *   (c) confiscation had a severe impact on the welfare, economy, and development of Taranaki iwi:
    
    *   (d) in general terms, the delays in setting aside reserves contributed to the adverse effects of the confiscations:
    
    *   (e) events relating to the implementation of the confiscations leading to the invasion of Parihaka in 1881, the invasion itself, and its aftermath constituted a breach of the principles of the [Treaty of Waitangi][180]:
    
    (20) On 11 June 1996, the Waitangi Tribunal released its interim report on the collective Taranaki Maori claims (Wai 143) entitled _The Taranaki Report: Kaupapa Tuatahi_:
    
    (21) This report contained the preliminary views of the Waitangi Tribunal and was issued---
        
    *   (a) based on the Tribunal's inquiry up to the date of the report (noting, in particular, that the Crown was yet to be heard on many matters raised); and
    
    *   (b) in order to expedite intended negotiations for a settlement in relation to the Taranaki claims:
    
    (22) The Waitangi Tribunal expressed some preliminary views concerning the Taranaki claims, including that---
        
    *   (a) the claims stood on 2 major foundations, land deprivation and disempowerment, with the latter being the main one. By disempowerment, the Waitangi Tribunal meant the denigration and destruction of Maori autonomy or self-government:
    
    *   (b) the Tribunal's Interim Report had introduced the historical claims of the Taranaki hapu and shown the need for a settlement:
    
    *   (c) generous reparation policies were needed to remove the prejudice to Maori, to restore the honour of the Government, to ensure cultural survival, and to re-establish effective interaction between the Treaty partners:
    
    ###### The settlement negotiations
    
    (23) In April 1998, the Crown recognised the mandate of the Ngati Ruanui Muru Me Te Raupatu Working Party to represent Ngati Ruanui (including Tangahoe and Pakakohi) in negotiations for a settlement with the Crown:
    
    (24) The Ngati Ruanui Muru Me Te Raupatu Working Party and the Crown entered into---
        
    *   (a) terms of negotiation on 31 August 1998 that specified the scope, objectives, and general procedures for the negotiations:
    
    *   (b) a heads of agreement on 7 September 1999, recording that Ngati Ruanui and the Crown were, in principle, willing to enter into a deed of settlement on the basis of the Crown's settlement proposal set out in the heads of agreement:
    
    (25) The Crown and the Ngati Ruanui Muru Me Te Raupatu Working Party initialled a deed of settlement on 1 March 2001:
    
    (26) Ngati Ruanui ratified the Crown's settlement offer and entered into a deed of settlement on 12 May 2001 that records the matters required to give effect to a full and final settlement of all of Ngati Ruanui's historical claims.
    
    ##### Kupu Whakataki
    
    (1) Ko [te Tiriti o Waitangi][180], e whakatauria atu nei i te Apitihanga Tuatahi ki te Ture o te Tiriti o Waitangi 1975, i nga reo e rua, i hainatia i te tau 1840:
    
    (2) Kei nga whiti (3) ki te (15) o tenei kupu whakataki ka horaina atu tetehi whakarapopototanga mo nga whakamarama i nga kereme o nehe o Ngati Ruanui, e tuhia ana i te Wahanga 6 o te whakaaetanga whakataunga i whakataturia e Ngati Ruanui me te Karauna:
    
    ###### I mua atu i te tau 1860
    
    (3) I nga tau mai i 1840 ki 1860 he taurikura te noho o Ngati Ruanui, ka hua he oranga nui ki a ratou, he nui nga mahi hokohoko ki nga taone a te Pakeha, me nga kaihokohoko ano hoki o tawahi. Heoti ano, no muri i te hainatanga o [te Tiriti o Waitangi][180], kihai tonu i mutu te whakahe a Ngati Ruanui ki nga hoko whenua Maori i Taranaki. Kia tae ki waenganui o nga tekau tau mai i 1860 kua oti tetehi kawenata na Ngati Ruanui me etehi atu iwi, kia kaua rawa e tukuna he whenua kia hokona. I te taenga ki te tau 1860 kaore ano i hokona tetehi wahi kotahi o nga whenua o Ngati Ruanui ki te Karauna:
    
    ###### Ko nga Pakanga i Taranaki
    
    (4) I te tau 1860 kaore i nuku a Ngati Ruanui, ka tautoko pumau i nga whanaunga i a Te Atiawa, i a Nga Rauru, i whakahe ki nga hoko whenua. Ko nga poraka i whakahengia ra te hoko ko Pekapeka me Waitotara. Ka panuitia e te Karauna ka mana te ture hoia puta noa i te rohe o Taranaki i te 22 o nga ra o Pepuere i te tau 1860\. He whakautu tenei ki nga whakakahore a ngai Maori ki nga whainga a te Karauna kia riro mai i a ia te poraka i Pekapeka, ki Waitara. Ka whai mai ko nga pakanga o Taranaki o nga tau 1860 ki 1861, me nga pakanga o nga tau 1863 ki 1869\. He nui tonu te mate o te tangata me te rironga o nga rawa o Ngati Ruanui i enei pakanga:
    
    (5) I te mutunga o te pakanga i te tau 1869 e 233 nga tane, nga wahine me nga tamariki o Te Pakakohi o Ngati Ruanui i tuku i o ratou patu, i muri i nga ki taurangi kore rawa ratou e whakamatea. He nui tonu i whakawatia mo te kaikaiwaiu, e 74 i whakawhiua kia whakamatea rawatia. Heoi ano, ka whakangawaritia aua whakawhiu, me mauhere ratou mo te 3 ki te 7 tau. Ka tonoa ki nga whare herehere i Te Waipounamu. 18 o te 74, neke atu pea, e mohiotia ana, i mate i mua i te tukunga ki waho. I muri i te putanga ki waho i te herehere kaore i tukua e te Kawanatanga kia hoki ki o ratou kainga ake:
    
    ###### Ko te Muru Raupatu
    
    (6) No te tau 1863 ka whakamanaia te Ture mo te Whakanoho i te Hunga Marie 1863 (New Zealand Settlements Act 1863). Whakamahia ai tenei ture hei muru i nga whenua o nga Maori i kiia, he whakakeke ta ratou ki te mana o te Kuini o Ingarangi mai i te tau 1863\. I raro ano i taua ture i te tau 1865, ka murua e te Kawana o Niu Tireni te maha o nga whenua o Ngati Ruanui. Na te panuitanga raupatu o te 2 o nga ra o Hepetema 1865 i whakapuaki, ko te katoa o te rohe o Taranaki ki te Tonga he wahi ka ahei te tango hei whakanohonoho i te iwi Pakeha:
    
    ###### Ko te Koti Kapeneihana
    
    (7) Ka whakaturia he Koti Kapeneihana i raro i te Ture Whakanoho o 1863, hei utu whakaeatanga ki etehi o te hunga i murua o ratou whenua e te Karauna. Ko nga Maori i kitea---e ai ki te Ture Whakanoho o 1863---kua hapai rakau ki te Karauna mai i te 1 o nga ra o Hanuere 1863, ko te hunga hoki i tautoko i aua Maori hapai rakau, kaore tonu i ahei kia whiwhi whakaeatanga. Ko te ture ia, me matua whakapumau e te kaikereme ona panga ki taua whenua, a, i piripono ratou ki te Karauna i mua. Tata ki te katoa o nga kaikereme e noho ana i roto i te rohe o Ngati Ruanui, i whakakahoretia a ratou tono whakaeatanga. E 40 noa iho o nga tangata 997, i whakatuturutia he tangata noho i reira, he piripono, i whakawhiwhia ki te katoa o te whakaeatanga a te Koti Kapeneihana, mo te wahanga o waenganui o te Rohe Takutai o Ngati Ruanui. Kaore kau i tika te whakatinanatanga o nga whiwhinga. No te taenga ki te tau 1880, i te timatatanga o nga mahi tirotiro a te Komihana mo te Tai Hauauru, kaore ano tetehi o nga tangata o Ngati Ruanui kia whiwhi whakaeatanga:
    
    ###### Ko nga Hokonga o Muri
    
    (8) I nga tau 1874 ki te 1881, ka taunahatia e te Karauna nga whenua o Ngati Ruanui i waho, i roto hoki i te rohe raupatu, na runga i nga hokonga i whakatinanatia i nga whakaaetanga tuku whenua. I te hokonga o enei whenua, kaore te Karauna i ata tirotiro ki nga take pupuru whenua. Tetehi mate ano i he ai nga hokonga i roto, i waho i te whaitua raupatu, kaore i whitikia e te ra nga whiriwhiringa, he mea huna. Waihoki te utu, he iti rawa, a, i tino iti rawa nga rahui i kiia tera e whakamanaia. Kaore i whakaoti tetehi o aua rahui i te takanga o te tau 1880, no reira ka raruraru a Ngati Ruanui, he tino iti rawa te whenua, a, he iti noa ano hoki te oranga mo ratou:
    
    ###### Parihaka
    
    (9) I muri i nga pakanga o Taranaki ka tuhono a Ngati Ruanui ki nga mahi atete ririkore o Parihaka, i raro i te mana o Tohu Kakahi raua ko Te Whiti o Rongomai. Ka whakaturia taua kainga i etehi whenua i Taranaki ki waenganui, a, ko te murunga o enei whenua e ai ki nga tirohanga, i waiho noa, kihai i oti. Kei raro i tenei kaupapa atete ririkore, ka haere nga mahi tangotango i nga tirau me nga taiapa a nga kairuri, me te parau i te whenua o nga Pakeha nohonoho i te whenua puta noa i te rohe o Taranaki. Neke atu i te 636 nga tangata mai i Taranaki whanui i hopukina, i mauheretia hoki. He torutoru noa enei tangata i whakawatia e te tiati. Ka whakamanaia he ture motuhake, te take tuatahi o taua ture he whakatarewa i te roanga atu o nga whakawa, te take tuarua he whakakore i aua whakawatanga. He nui tonu nga mauhere, ko nga tangata tonu o Ngati Ruanui etehi, i purutia atu ki nga whare herehere i Te Waipounamu, a, he whakawiri te noho, he mahi pakeke te whiu i etehi:
    
    (10) I te tau 1881 ka whakaekea te kainga o Parihaka e nga hoia a te Karauna, neke atu i 1 500 te ope, ka nohoia te pa. I nga ra i muri, neke atu i te 1 600 nga tane, nga wahine me nga tamariki, ehara no Parihaka taketake enei tangata, i panaia i te kainga. Ka horoa nga whare me nga mara i te takiwa, ka aia atu nga kararehe, ka patua ranei. E ai ki nga Maori o Taranaki i pawheratia etehi wahine, i takakinotia ranei e nga kaiwhakaeke:
    
    (11) Ko nga tino kaihautu o Parihaka, ko Tohu Kakahi raua ko Te Whiti o Rongomai, ka mauheretia, ka haere hoki he ture motuhake mo te mauheretanga, kaore he whakawatanga:
    
    ###### Ko nga Komihana me te Ture mo nga Rahui a te Whakataunga o te Tai Hauauru 1881 (West Coast Settlement Reserves Act 1881)
    
    (12) E rua nga Komihana mo Te Tai Hauauru i tohua i te tau 1880\. Ko ta te tuatahi he tirotiro ki nga whakawhiwhinga a te Koti Kopureihana, me nga ki taurangi a te Karauna ki nga tangata Maori o Taranaki mo nga whenua raupatu. Ko te tuarua, i whakaturia hei whakatinana i nga tohutohu a te tuatahi. Kua oti ke a Taranaki ki te raki, me Taranaki ki te tonga te whakanohonoho i te Pakeha. Na konei kaore i watea he whenua nui hei rahui totika. Iti noa te whenua i whakahokia, i Taranaki ki te tonga. Ko te nuinga o o Ngati Ruanui whenua momona o te takutai i purutia ketia e te Karauna. Heoti ano te whenua i whakahokia ki a ratou he whenua moroiti, kaore i nui rawa hei oranga, hei whanaketanga ranei mo nga ra o muri:
    
    (13) Tata ki te katoa o nga whenua i whakahokia, he taitara takitahi, na, ka raru nga tikanga me te mana pupuru whenua o te hapu, kaore he arainga atu i nga hoko whai i muri:
    
    (14) Ko nga rahui i wehea mai e te Komihana mo Te Tai Hauauru ka whakaritea atu ma te Kaitiaki Matua (Public Trustee) e whakahaere, ma nga rangatira Maori o aua whenua, a, ka ngaro i konei o ratou whainga tika hei rangatira o aua whenua. I te Kaitiaki ano te tino mana hei hoko i nga rahui i ahei ai te hoko, me te rihi i nga rahui kaore i whakaaetia kia hokona i raro ano i nga whakaritenga o te ture. Ko tetehi wahi nui o aua whenua i rihitia ki nga tangata nohonoho i aua whenua, he rihi i ahei te whakahou mo ake tonu atu. Na tenei whakaritenga, kaore i whakaaetia e Ngati Ruanui, i whakaporaru te mana o Ngati Ruanui ki o ratou whenua, me te kaha o Ngati Ruanui ki te tango moni rihi hoki i o ratou whenua:
    
    (15) No te tau 1926 ka noho te Komihana a Te Himi (Sim Commission) ki te ata tirotiro i nga murunga raupatu i raro i te Ture Whakanoho o te tau 1863 (New Zealand Settlements Act 1863), me nga ture whai i muri. Ko nga whakaritenga a te Komihana mo tetehi putea a-tau, e 5 000 pauna mo nga whenua raupatu katoa o Taranaki, me tetehi moni e 300 pauna, mo nga rironga taonga i Parihaka, kaore i ata korerotia ki te iwi whai panga, kaore hoki i whakaaetia e te iwi he totika tenei utu. Kaore i ata tau nga wa e utua ai, na konei kaore i utua te katoa o nga moni e tika ana kia utua i nga tau tuatahi o te tekau tau mai i 1930:
    
    ###### He roa noa a Ngati Ruanui e totohe ana ki tenei take, kia whakaeangia
    
    (16) He roa tonu nga kereme a nga Maori o Taranaki, tae atu ki a Ngati Ruanui, ki te Karauna. Ko enei take i whakaputaina ma roto i nga pitihana me nga whakahe a nga Maori o Taranaki, tae atu ki a Ngati Ruanui. Na enei pitihana me enei whakahe, ka whakaturia etehi komihana uiui mo nga whenua Maori i murua i nga Maori o Taranaki, i nga rau tau tekau ma iwa, me te rau tau rua tekau ano hoki:
    
    ###### Ko nga Kereme i raro i te Ture o te Tiriti o Waitangi 1975
    
    (17) Na te whakamananga o te Ture Whakatikatika i te Ture mo te Tiriti o Waitangi 1985 i ahei ai te tangata Maori ki te whakatakoto kereme ki mua i te aroaro o te Ropu Whakamana i [te Tiriti o Waitangi][180] mo nga mahi, mo nga hapanga i mahia e te Karauna, mo te Karauna ranei, i te ra 6 o te marama o Pepuere 1840, i muri mai ranei, kaore i hangai ki nga matapono o te Tiriti o Waitangi:
    
    (18) Mai i te tau 1990 ki te tau 1995, ka tirohia e te Ropu Whakamana i te Tiriti o Waitangi nga take 21 mo nga iwi Maori o Taranaki, ko Ngati Ruanui tetehi wahanga o enei:
    
    ###### Ko nga Whakatau mo tenei wa o te Ropu Whakamana i te Tiriti o Waitangi
    
    (19) Ka whakaae te Karauna ki te Ropu Whakamana i te Tiriti o Waitangi, i tona urupare tuatahi ki nga kereme o Taranaki:
        
    *   (a) I tino he te hokonga o Waitara me nga pakanga i whai muri, a, he mahi enei i takahi i nga matapono o [te Tiriti o Waitangi][180]:
    
    *   (b) I he hoki te murunga whenua, pera i nga raupatu o Taranaki, na konei i takahia ai nga matapono o [te Tiriti o Waitangi][180]:
    
    *   (c) I tino toimaha rawa te papatanga o te mahi muru whenua ki te oranga, ki te ohanga, ki te whanaketanga hoki o nga iwi o Taranaki:
    
    *   (d) kia penei pea te korero, na nga takaroatanga o te whakarite whenua rahui i kino ke ake ai te toimahatanga o nga raupatu:
    
    *   (e) ko nga mahi whakatinana i nga raupatu, i hua ake ai te whakaeketanga a Parihaka i te tau 1881, te whakaeketanga tonutanga, me nga ahuatanga whai i muri, he takahanga katoa enei i nga matapono o [te Tiriti o Waitangi][180]:
    
    (20) No te 11 o nga ra o Hune 1996, ka whakaputaina e te Ropu Whakamana i te Tiriti o Waitangi tana purongo tuatahi mo nga kereme topu o nga iwi Maori o Taranaki (Wai 143). Ko te ingoa, ko ""The Taranaki Report: Kaupapa Tuatahi"":
    
    (21) Kei tenei purongo nga whakaaro tuatahi o te Ropu Whakamana i te Tiriti o Waitangi, a, i whakaputaina:
        
    *   (a) i runga ano i nga rapunga korero a te Ropu Whakamana i te Tiriti o Waitangi tae mai ki te ra o taua purongo (me tana kupu whakamarama, kaore ano te Karauna kia rangona mo etehi take maha i whakaarahia);
    
    *   (b) kia hohoro ai nga whiriwhiringa, kia kite ai he whakataunga e pa ana ki nga take o Taranaki:
    
    (22) Ka whakaputaina e te Ropu Whakamana i te Tiriti o Waitangi etehi whakaaro tuatahi mo nga kereme o Taranaki, a, ko etehi:
        
    *   (a) e rua nga pou matua o enei kereme, ara, ko te rironga o te whenua, ko te turakitanga o te mana, a, ko to muri te mea nui atu. Ko te turakitanga o te mana, e ai ki te Ropu Whakamana i te Tiriti o Waitangi ko te whakahaweatanga me te whakamotitanga o te mana motuhake me te tino rangatiratanga a te Maori:
    
    *   (b) na tenei purongo tuatahi a te Ropu Whakamana i te Tiriti o Waitangi i whakauru nga kereme o nehe o Taranaki, nana hoki i waitohu he mea tika kia kitea he whakatau:
    
    *   (c) he tika tonu kia hangaia he kaupapa whakahoki taonga, hei whakaea i nga hara o mua, hei whakaora i te mana o te Kawanatanga, hei whakapiki i te oranga o te ahurea Maori, hei whakanoho hoki i te wairua whakawhanaunga i waenganui i nga hoa Tiriti:
    
    ###### Ko nga Whiriwhiringa mo te Whakataunga
    
    (23) No te marama o Aperira 1998, ka whakaae te Karauna ki te mana o te ropu e kiia nei, ko Ngati Ruanui Muru Me Te Raupatu hei kanohi mo Ngati Ruanui (kei roto nei a Tangahoe me Te Pakakohi) i roto i nga whiriwhiringa ki te Karauna:
    
    (24) Na konei ka whakatauria e te ropu mahi a Ngati Ruanui Muru Me Te Raupatu me te Karauna:
        
    *   (a) nga Whakaritenga o nga Whiriwhiringa i te 31 o nga ra o Akuhata 1998, i whakatakotoria ai te whanui o te titiro, nga whainga me nga tikanga whakahaere mo enei whiriwhiringa:
    
    *   (b) he Whakaaetanga Taketake i te 7 o nga ra o Hepetema 1999, e whakaatu ana i te hiahia ngatahi o Ngati Ruanui me te Karauna ki te tatu i tetehi Whakaaetanga o nga Whakataunga, i runga ano i te kaupapa whakataunga a te Karauna i tatau ai i roto i taua Whakaaetanga Taketake:

    >

    > *   "(2) The Crown sincerely regrets that Ngawaka Taurua and his people suffered a heavy punishment due to a decision of the Government of the day to make an example of them in order to deter other Maori from taking up arms against the Queen's authority. The Crown acknowledges that:
    >         
    >     *   "(a) this punishment deprived Pakakohi of Ngati Ruanui of a significant number of their leaders; and

    >     
    > 
    > *   "(3) The Crown acknowledges that:
    >

    >     *   "(b) that these actions caused great distress and were a complete denial of the Maori right to develop and sustain autonomous communities in a peaceful manner; and
    >     
    >     *   "(c) that its treatment of the people of Ngati Ruanui residing at Parihaka was unconscionable and unjust and that these actions constituted a breach of the [Treaty of Waitangi][180] and the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi.

Taki Poipoia o Ngati Ruanui

[ss 12][15], [72][102]

#### _Description of area_

The area over which the Taki Poipoia o Ngati Ruanui is created is the area known as Wai-Ariki (part of the Waitotara conservation area), as shown marked A on SO 14735\.

#### _Preamble_

Under [section 73][103], the Crown acknowledges Ngati Ruanui's statement of their cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional values relating to Wai-Ariki, as set out below.

#### _Ngati Ruanui's statement of Ngati Ruanui values relating to Wai-Ariki_

Wai-Ariki is the name of the spring that is the source of the Whenuakura River. It was between the Whenuakura and Patea nui a Turi rivers that Turi Ariki settled with his family and named the 2 rivers. Turi was the Ariki (Rangatira of highest rank) of the Aotea Waka, which he left at Kawhia before travelling overland to settle between the Patea and Whenuakura rivers.

The spring Wai-Ariki was so named because of the spiritual significance it had in relation to the Whenuakura river and the Ariki status of the people who lived beside and were nurtured by the rich resources it provided.

To the people of Ngati Hine, the names have the following meanings:

Whenuakura:_the land belonging to those of high rank; and_

Wai-Ariki:_the waters of nga Ariki_.

## Schedule 5  
Statutory acknowledgement for Otoki Gorge Scenic Reserve

[s 88][120]

#### _Statutory area_

The area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the area known as the Otoki Gorge scenic reserve, as shown on SO 14738\.

#### _Preamble_

Under [section 88][120], the Crown acknowledges the statement by Ngati Ruanui of the cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association of Ngati Ruanui with the Otoki Gorge scenic reserve as set out below.

#### _Cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association of Ngati Ruanui with the Otoki Gorge scenic reserve_

The Pukemoko Pa site is located within the Otoki Gorge scenic reserve, which can be found within the area of Whakamara. It was within this pa that Wharematangi, a Rangatira of Ngati Hine (a close fighting ally of Hanataua of Tangahoe), resided before joining Hanataua in his battles with Waikato and Te Rauparaha of Ngati Raukawa.

The pa was a large ridge pa, which had general usage. Its strategic geographical position made it ideal as a fortified village. During the time of warfare, sharp contoured hills, thick underbrush, hidden man-made traps, and skilled warriors knowledgeable in the surrounding rugged terrain made life a misery for those who attempted to conquer the pa. In modern times, this manner of warfare is commonly recognised as ""guerrilla tactics"".

Within the surrounding valleys, the richness of the soil and waterways provided an abundance of food (birds, animals, fish), building materials, and materials for clothing, gardening, and warfare. Otoki was also used as one of the sites for gathering in times of peace.

The pa remains one of the areas where the footsteps of our Tupuna remain pristine. The area remains uncut, uncultivated, and in its unspoiled state. It is a remote place where the people would be able to sit and reflect on the life of their ancestors sensing the Ihi (power), Wehi (fear), and the Mauri (life force) emanating from the land.

#### _Purposes of statutory acknowledgement_

Under [section 89][121], and without limiting the rest of this schedule, the only purposes of this statutory acknowledgement are---

## Schedule 6  
Statutory acknowledgement for Te Moananui A Kupe O Ngati Ruanui

[s 88][120]

#### _Statutory area_

The area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the area known as Te Moananui A Kupe O Ngati Ruanui (coastal area) as shown on SO 14739\.

#### _Preamble_

Under [section 88][120], the Crown acknowledges the statement by Ngati Ruanui of the cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association of Ngati Ruanui with Te Moananui A Kupe O Ngati Ruanui (coastal area) as set out below.

#### _Cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association of Ngati Ruanui with Te Moananui A Kupe O Ngati Ruanui_

The resources found within Te Moananui A Kupe have, since time immemorial, provided the people of Ngati Ruanui with a constant supply of food resources. The hidden reefs provided koura, paua, kina, pupu, papaka, pipi, tuatua, and many other species of reef inhabitants. Hapuka, moki, kanae, mako, and patiki swim freely between the many reefs that can be found stretching out into the spiritual waters of Te Moananui A Kupe and along the Ngati Ruanui coastline.

Names such as Rangatapu, Ohawe Tokotoko, Waihi, Waokena, Tangahoe, Manawapou, Taumaha, Manutahi, Pipiri, Kaikura, Whitikau, Kenepuru, Te Pou a Turi, Rangitawhi, and Whenuakura depict the whereabouts of either a fishing ground or fishing reef.

All along the shoreline from Rangatapu to Whenuakura food can be gathered, depending on the tides, weather, and time of year.

Tragedies of the sea are also linked to these reefs. Ngati Ruanui oral history records the sinking off Tangahoe of a Chinese trade ship that had just been loaded with a cargo of flax. When the bodies were recovered and brought to shore, none of them had any eyes.

The people of Ngati Hine believe that they did something wrong and in turn were punished by the Ngati Ruanui taniwha named Toi, kaitiaki (guardian) of the fishing reefs and grounds, who is renowned to this day to eat the eyes of his victims.

## Schedule 7  
Statutory acknowledgement for Tangahoe River

[s 88][120]

#### _Statutory area_

The area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the area known as the Tangahoe River, as shown on SO 14740\.

#### _Preamble_

Under [section 88][120], the Crown acknowledges the statement by Ngati Ruanui of the cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association of Ngati Ruanui with the Tangahoe River as set out below.

#### _Cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association of Ngati Ruanui with the Tangahoe River_

Ngati Ruanui history informs us that the people of the Kahui Maunga (mountain people of the highest rank) inhabited the South Taranaki area prior to the arrival of the Aotea Waka. They in turn were vanquished and enveloped through warfare and intermarriage into the Aotea, Ruanui-a Pokiwa history. One of the areas in which these people were renowned to have flourished is known as the Tangahoe River and valley.

The late Ueroa (Charlie) Ngarewa, an elder of both Tangahoe and Ngati Hine descent, gave one version of the origin of the name Tangahoe. He said the name Tangahoe was given to the river because of an incident that occurred, in which the steering oar was lost from a large deep-sea fishing waka as it attempted to return to the Tauranga waka. The comment was made that ""if there were 2 steering oars like that of the Waka Tipua of Turi Ariki, then the flight to its resting place would remain true."" Turi was the Ariki (Rangatira of highest rank) of the Aotea Waka.

Tangahoe:_the steering oars of Turi Ariki_

The Tangahoe River has been a major supply of food and water resources to its people both prior to, and since, the arrival of the Aotea Waka. The valley, like the rest of the southern lands, was a fertile paradise. Because of the mild temperatures, it was without extremes and promoted lush vegetation that was checked only by the occasional equinoctial weather patterns. Birds such as manunui (which made its nests amongst the koromiko bushes), kereru (the food of nga Ariki), pukeko (the treasured species brought on the Aotea Waka), tiwaiwaka (the guardian left by Kupe), kahu (the sentinel), kakapo, kiwi, korimako, miromiro (the custodians of the forest), and pipiwharauroa (the heralder of the new year) flourished in the berry-filled trees, like the koromiko, kohia, hinau, piripiri, mamaku, and rewarewa at the side of the eel- and koura-filled creeks. Fish, such as the piharau, kokopu, tunaheke, patiki, and shellfish, were abundant in the waters and on the reefs at the mouth of the river.

During the time of internal warfare, the valley through which the river runs was a trap for the unwary. The many re-entrants and secondary valleys provided natural hiding and attacking areas and, if necessary, places of refuge.

To the people of Ngati Ruanui, all the rivers and their respective valleys are of the utmost importance because of their physical, spiritual, and social significance in the past, present, and future.

## Schedule 8  
Statutory acknowledgement for Whenuakura River

[s 88][120]

#### _Statutory area_

The area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the area known as the Whenuakura River, as shown on SO 14741\.

#### _Preamble_

Under [section 88][120], the Crown acknowledges the statement by Ngati Ruanui of the cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association of Ngati Ruanui with the Whenuakura River as set out below.

#### _Cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association of Ngati Ruanui with the Whenuakura River_

The name of this river originated during the time of Turi Arikinui, Kaihautu of the Waka Tipua Aotea, and his wife Rongorongo Tapairu. They lived with their families between the 2 rivers, Patea nui a Turi and Whenuakura. Turi was the Ariki (Rangatira of highest rank) of the Aotea Waka.

Whenuakura:_the land belonging to the people of high rank_

Like the Tangahoe River, this river provided the people of the Aotea Waka, and later the people of Ngati Hine and Ngati Tupito, with all the resources of life they required to survive.

The valley through which the river flowed provided multiple bird life, animals, clothing, building, gardening, and warfare implements, as well as places where social activities, fishing, and waka racing could take place. Sporting activities took place within and outside the surrounding forests. There were also places that Tohunga, Rangatira, and other whanau/hapu/iwi representatives used for burial, washing, baptising, and special activities. It was a place where people would go to find peace within themselves.

This river, like the others within the rohe, will always be an integral part of the social, spiritual, and physical lifestyle of the Ngati Ruanui people.

## Schedule 9  
Statutory acknowledgement for Patea River

[s 88][120]

#### _Statutory area_

The area to which this statutory acknowledgement applies is the area known as the Patea River (excluding Lake Rotorangi), as shown on SO 14742\.

#### _Preamble_

Under [section 88][120], the Crown acknowledges the statement by Ngati Ruanui of the cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association of Ngati Ruanui with the Patea River as set out below.

#### _Cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association of Ngati Ruanui with the Patea River_

The full name of this river is Patea nui a Turi. It was named by Turi on his arrival overland after leaving the Aotea Waka at Kawhia. The name Patea was given by Turi Ariki when, upon seeing nga kaitiaki (the guardians) left by Kupe as guides for him and his family, he exclaimed ""Ka Patea tatou"" -- _we have arrived at Patea_.

Since that arrival, the river has played an important part in the lifestyles of the Aotea people. The riverbanks have provided the soil for the gardens of Rongorongo Tapairu called Hekeheke I papa, the karaka grove called Papawhero, and the spring of life of Turi and Rongorongo called Parara-ki-te-Uru.

The source of the Patea River is on the mountain Rua Taranaki and is called Whakapou Karakia.

Whakapou Karakia can be found upon the mountain Rua Taranaki within the rohe of Ngati Ruanui.

Upon the arrival of the Aotea people to South Taranaki from Kawhia, Turi Ariki at Te Pou a Turi laid claim to the surrounding territory and the river, which until then has been known as ""Te Awa o Taikehu"", as belonging to him and his descendants. Upon completing the respective rituals to protect the newly gained lands from unwanted entities, he then proceeded to spiritually purify the rest of the area.

The newly claimed river, because of its spiritual and life-giving resources, was then traversed and spiritual Kaitiaki sown in every location that was to become significant to the people of the Aotea Waka along the total length of the river. These purifying rituals continued to the source of the river on the mountain. It was at this locality upon the mountain that the final Karakia of protection was performed to unite all the Kaitiaki as one in the protection of the waters and resources pertaining to the river, hence---

## Schedule 11  
Statements of association of Ngati Ruanui

[ss 109][148], [111][151]

## Part 1  
Statement by Ngati Ruanui of cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association of Ngati Ruanui with Nga Taonga a Tane raua ko Tangaroa

The whaikorero (oral history) of our tupuna of old, and now honoured by each generation thereafter, places the utmost importance on the role of Ngati Ruanui as kaitiaki (guardians) for all the life forms of the environment. Ngati Ruanui have always believed that the environment, including all indigenous species of fish, flora, and fauna, are interrelated through whakapapa and are all precious to Ngati Ruanui. All species are important and all play their particular role within the environment. The integration of all species in the environment is woven within the holistic pattern of life itself. Ngati Ruanui as a people are part and parcel of the environment itself.

Ngati Ruanui recognise that any negative effects on one species may cause ill effects for other species. Ngati Ruanui continue to maintain a kaitiaki (guardian) role to look after all species within our environment.

The mauri (life force) of all species is important to Ngati Ruanui, the essence that binds the physical and spiritual elements of all things together, generating and upholding all life. All species of the natural environment possess a life force, and all forms of life are related.

## Part 2  
Statement by Ngati Ruanui of cultural, spiritual, historical, and traditional association of Ngati Ruanui with purangi

Purangi is the name of the green stone known as argillite found within the rohe of Ngati Ruanui.

The legend of purangi has its origin back in time during the mystical and legendary period of the spiritual bird, Te Manu-nui a Ruakapanga. Ruakapanga was the name given to the manu that flew between the heavens and earth as a Kaitiaki for both Nga Atua me nga Tangata. This manu was believed to drink from the waters of Rua Taranaki at a place named ""Nga Wai o Ruakapanga"" and then fly on to the inland region of purangi (the place) to feed. Legend has it that purangi was formed from the spittle of Ruakapanga that fell when it fed. Ngati Ruanui used to gather food and natural resources, such as purangi, from that particular region.

Purangi is the only known local argillite within the Taranaki region. Although argillite comes in many colours, the only other known source of this green-coloured argillite is on D'Urville Island (known by Ngati Ruanui as ""Ngamotu o Raumano""). Purangi is a hard, fine-grained, and distinctly green-coloured kohatu.

Purangi is one of the rock types that was taken from a steep valley in the inland region (near Mangaehu) and made into adzes by Ngati Ruanui. The discovery of a significant percentage of adzes in the coastal belt of Taranaki that could have been made from rocks common in the inland Taranaki region has led historians to infer that there were strong cultural ties between inland and coastal Maori. A common saying within many hapu of Ngati Ruanui is ""Ngati Ruanui ki Uta, Ngati Ruanui ki Tai, Ngati Ruanui ki Tai, Ngati Ruanui ki Uta, orite""---_Ngati Ruanui extends from the inland areas to the sea, from the sea to the inland areas_.
