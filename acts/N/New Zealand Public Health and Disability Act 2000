##### 1 Title
    
*   This Act is the New Zealand Public Health and Disability Act 2000\.

## Part 1  
Preliminary provisions

##### 2 Commencement
    
*   (1) [Sections 8][10], [106][138], and [114][150] come into force on the day after the date on which this Act receives the Royal assent.
    
    (2) The rest of this Act comes into force on 1 January 2001\.

##### 3 Purpose
    
*   (1) The purpose of this Act is to provide for the public funding and provision of personal health services, public health services, and disability support services, and to establish new publicly-owned health and disability organisations, in order to pursue the following objectives:
        
    *   (a) to achieve for New Zealanders---
            
        *   (i) the improvement, promotion, and protection of their health:
        
        *   (ii) the promotion of the inclusion and participation in society and independence of people with disabilities:
        
        *   (iii) the best care or support for those in need of services:
        
        
    
    *   (b) to reduce health disparities by improving the health outcomes of Maori and other population groups:
    
    *   (c) to provide a community voice in matters relating to personal health services, public health services, and disability support services---
            
        *   (i) by providing for elected board members of DHBs:
        
        *   (ii) by providing for board meetings and certain committee meetings to be open to the public:
        
        *   (iii) by providing for consultation on strategic planning:
        
        
    
    *   (d) to facilitate access to, and the dissemination of information to deliver, appropriate, effective, and timely health services, public health services and programmes, both for the protection and the promotion of public health, and disability support services.
    
    (2) The objectives stated in subsection (1) are to be pursued to the extent that they are reasonably achievable within the funding provided.
    
    (3) To avoid any doubt, nothing in this Act---
        
    *   (a) entitles a person to preferential access to services on the basis of race; or
    
    *   (b) limits [section 73][163] of the Human Rights Act 1993 (which relates to measures to ensure equality).
    
    (4) In giving effect to the purposes set out in subsection (1), the Crown and DHBs must endeavour to promote the integration of all health services, especially primary and secondary services.
    
    (5) In giving effect to the purposes set out in subsection (1), the Crown and DHBs must endeavour to provide for health services to be organised at either a local, regional, or national level depending on the optimum arrangement for the most effective delivery of properly co-ordinated health services.

##### 4 Treaty of Waitangi
    
*   In order to recognise and respect the principles of the [Treaty of Waitangi][164], and with a view to improving health outcomes for Maori, [Part 3][21] provides for mechanisms to enable Maori to contribute to decision-making on, and to participate in the delivery of, health and disability services.

##### 5 Outline
    
*   (1) In general terms, this Act relates to, and reorganises, the public health and disability sector.
    
    (2) Ministerial responsibilities ([Part 2][9]) include---
        
    *   (a) determining health and disability strategies ([section 8][10]):
    
    *   (b) negotiating and entering into agreements under which the Crown provides a person money in return for the person providing or arranging for the provision of health services or disability support services ([section 10][12]):
    
    *   (c) establishing and appointing committees ([section 11][13]), including---

        *   (ii) a health workforce advisory committee ([section 15][17]):

        *   (iv) mortality review committees ([section 18][20] and [Schedule 5][157]).
        
        
    
    (3) District Health Boards (**DHBs**) are established ([Part 3][21] and [Schedules 1 to 3][151]), and take over functions like those of Hospital and Health Services (**HHSs**), which are dissolved ([Part 7][121]). DHBs---
        
    *   (a) have boards that include members elected by the community and representation of Maori:
    
    *   (b) will provide, or fund the provision of, health services and disability support services:
    
    *   (c) have the objective of reducing health disparities by improving health outcomes for Maori and other New Zealanders:
    
    *   (d) are statutory entities rather than companies:
    
    *   (e) are accountable in a number of ways (under the [Crown Entities Act 2004][165] and [sections 38 to 42][47]), for example, through plans prepared under [section 38][47], and statements of intent.
    
    (4) The board of each DHB must have 3 permanent advisory committees (the community and public health advisory committee, disability support advisory committee, and hospital advisory committee ([sections 34 to 36][42] and [Schedule 4][154])), but may also establish other committees (Schedule 3---[clause 38(1)][166]).
    
    (5) A statutory entity called the Pharmaceutical Management Agency (**Pharmac**) is established (Part 4---[sections 46 to 53][59], and [sections 61 to 69][85], and [Schedule 6][158]), and takes over functions relating to the pharmaceutical schedule from the company called Pharmaceutical Management Agency Limited, which is dissolved ([Part 7][121]).
    
    (6) A statutory entity called the New Zealand Blood Service (**NZBS**) is established (Part 4---[sections 54 to 56][68], and [sections 61 to 69][85], and [Schedule 6][158]), and takes over functions relating to blood and controlled human substances from the company called New Zealand Blood Service Limited, which is dissolved ([Part 7][121]).
    
    (7) A Crown entity called the Health Promotion Agency (**HPA**) is established (Part 4---[sections 57 to 59][72]).
    
    (7A) A statutory entity called the Health Quality and Safety Commission (**HQSC**) is established (Part 4---[sections 59A to 59E][78], [60][84], [61][85], [66][90], [67][91], and [69][93] and [Schedule 6][158]), and has functions that relate to the improvement of the quality and safety of health and disability support services.
    
    (8) Inquiry boards may be appointed by the Minister of Health to conduct an inquiry into, and report to the Minister on, matters like the funding or provision of health services or disability support services, or the management of any publicly-owned health and disability organisation (Part 5---[sections 72 to 86][99]).
    
    (9) The Health Funding Authority (**HFA**) is dissolved, and its functions, employees, and assets and liabilities transferred to the Crown, acting through the Ministry of Health ([Part 7][121]). However, funding of the provision of health services or disability support services may be further devolved under this Act.
    
    (10) Subsections (1) to (9) are only a guide to the general scheme and effect of this Act.
    
    Section 5(3)(d): amended, on 25 January 2005, by [section 200][167] of the Crown Entities Act 2004 (2004 No 115).

    *   (b) sets terms and conditions in respect of particular services that depart from terms and conditions set out in an existing notice in respect of the same or substantially the same services; or
    
    *   (c) differentiates between persons or classes of person accepting payment under [section 88][116].
    
    (4) The Minister's approval may be given subject to any conditions the Minister specifies.
    
    (5) Any notice under [section 88][116] that departs from an existing notice in the manner referred to in subsection (3)(b) or differentiates in the manner referred to in subsection (3)(c) must include a statement of the reasons for the departure or differentiation.

    (2) For the purposes of [clauses 3][494] and [5][495], where any wine manufactured in New Zealand is sold to another winemaker for blending with other wine, the wine so sold is deemed to be manufactured by the person who blends it, and not by its original maker.
    
    (3) For the purposes of [clause 3(2)][494], the total number of litres of wine manufactured in New Zealand during any statistical year is deemed to be the same as the total number of litres of wine sold by winemakers during that year.
    
    (4) For the purposes of [clauses 5][495] and [6][496], the total number of litres of wine sold in New Zealand during any financial year is deemed to be the same as the total number of litres of wine sold in New Zealand during the preceding statistical year.
    
    (5) For the purposes of [clause 3(2)][494] and [Schedule 4B][156], alcohol that is exported from New Zealand during the preceding statistical year is not to be treated as alcohol that is imported into or manufactured in New Zealand.

##### 2 Minister to assess aggregate expenditure figure and determine aggregate levy figure
    
*   (1) For each financial year, the Minister, acting with the concurrence of the Minister of Finance, must assess the aggregate expenditure figure for that year that, in his or her opinion, would be reasonable for HPA to expend during that year---
        
    *   (a) in addressing alcohol-related harm; and
    
    *   (b) in meeting its operating costs that are attributable to alcohol-related activities.
    
    (2) Having assessed the aggregate expenditure figure for any financial year under subclause (1), the Minister must determine the aggregate levy figure for that year, being an amount equal to the aggregate expenditure figure less the amount that, in his or her opinion, is likely to be received by HPA during the financial year by way of interest on money invested by HPA or from third party or other revenue.
    
    (3) Nothing in this clause obliges HPA to expend in any financial year the whole of its income received in that year, and HPA may accumulate any part of its income in any financial year and expend it as it sees fit for any of its purposes in any subsequent financial year.
    
    (4) Despite subclause (2), if HPA carries forward any such amount to a subsequent financial year, the Minister may, in determining the aggregate levy figure for that year, take into account the whole or any part of that amount.

##### 3 Minister to determine amounts of levy for each class of alcohol
    
*   (1) After assessing the aggregate levy figure for any financial year, the Minister must determine, in accordance with subclause (2), the amounts of the levies payable under [clause 5][495], in respect of each class of alcohol, in order to yield an amount equivalent to the aggregate levy figure.
    
    (2) The process for determining the amounts of levy is as follows:
        
    *   (a) _Step 1_---for each class of alcohol, determine the total number of litres of that class of alcohol that was imported into or manufactured in New Zealand during the preceding statistical year:
    
    *   (b) _Step 2_---for each class of alcohol, multiply the result of step 1 by the appropriate rate, as set out in the table in [Schedule 4B][156]. This gives the (nominal) total number of litres of alcohol for each class of alcohol:
    
    *   (c) _Step 3_---for each class of alcohol, divide the number of litres of alcohol for that class by the total number of litres of alcohol for all classes. This gives the proportion of the aggregate levy figure that is to be borne by that class of alcohol in the next financial year:
    
    *   (d) _Step 4_---for each class of alcohol, multiply the result of step 3 by the aggregate levy figure. This gives the amount of levy to be borne by each class of alcohol in the next financial year:
    
    *   (e) _Step 5_---for each class of alcohol, divide the result of step 4 by the result of step 1\. This gives the amount of levy payable on each litre of alcohol of that class in the next financial year.
    
    (3) If a rate for a class of alcohol is described in the table in [Schedule 4B][156] as a variable rate, the Minister must---
        
    *   (a) determine the rate to be applied to that class of alcohol; and
    
    *   (b) in making that determination, use the method for determining variable rates that is described in [Schedule 4B][156].
    
    

##### 4 Rate of levy fixed by Order in Council
    
*   (1) The Governor-General may, by Order in Council, fix for the next financial year, by reference to each class of alcohol, the amount of levy payable under [clause 5][495].
    
    (2) The amount of levy for each class of alcohol must be as determined by the Minister in accordance with [clause 3(2)][494].
    
    (3) If a rate for a class of alcohol is described in the table in [Schedule 4B][156] as a variable rate, the Order in Council must identify the rate determined by the Minister under [clause 3(3)][494] and used for the purpose of clause 3(2).

##### 5 Levies payable by importers and manufacturers of alcohol
    
*   (1) In every financial year, a levy of the amount set by Order in Council made under [clause 4][497] is payable by every person who---
        
    *   (a) enters for home consumption (as that expression is used in the [Customs and Excise Act 1996][498]) any imported alcohol that contains more than 1.15% volume of alcohol; or
    
    *   (b) manufactures in New Zealand any beer or spirits; or
    
    *   (c) sells any wine manufactured by that person in New Zealand.
    
    (2) No levy is payable under this Act in respect of any alcohol that is not subject to or is exempt from Customs duty under the [Customs and Excise Act 1996][498].
    
    (3) If any person may be allowed, under the [Customs and Excise Act 1996][498], any drawback in respect of any alcohol, that person may also be allowed a refund of any levy paid by that person under this Act in respect of that alcohol.
    
    (4) In this section, _Customs duty_ has the meaning given to the term duty by [section 2(1)][499] of the Customs and Excise Act 1996\.

##### 6 Payment and collection of levies in respect of beer, wine, and spirits
    
*   (1) All levies payable under this Act in respect of any beer, wine, or spirits are payable to the Customs in addition to any duty payable to the Customs in respect of the beer, wine, or spirits under the [Customs and Excise Act 1996][498].
    
    (2) For the purposes of subclause (1), the levies are payable to the Customs at the same time as the excise duty or excise-equivalent duty is payable under the [Customs and Excise Act 1996][498] in respect of the beer, wine, or spirits concerned.

##### 7 Powers of the Customs

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the New Zealand Public Health and Disability Act 2000\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 July 2012, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][617] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][618] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][619] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][620] and [17E][621] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
