An Act to enable The National Bank of New Zealand, Limited to become a public company deemed to be incorporated in New Zealand under the Companies Act 1955, and to repeal the National Bank of New Zealand (Limited) Act 1873
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    Whereas---
        
    *   A The National Bank of New Zealand, Limited (hereinafter called the **Bank**) is an existing company within the meaning of the Companies Acts 1948 to 1983 of England as a company limited by shares and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lloyds Bank Plc:
    
    *   B the Bank was incorporated in England under the Companies Act 1862 on 14 August 1872 and further incorporated in New Zealand under the National Bank of New Zealand (Limited) Act 1873 of New Zealand:
    
    *   C the Bank carries on the business of banking principally in New Zealand but also in other parts of the world:
    
    *   D the situation of the central management and control of the Bank was transferred from England to New Zealand with effect from the commencement of 1 January 1978:
    
    *   E as the central management and control of the Bank is now in New Zealand and the area of operation of the Bank is largely in New Zealand, it is considered appropriate that the Bank be incorporated only under the laws of New Zealand rather than under those laws and the laws of England:
    
    *   F it is considered desirable that the Bank become a public company limited by shares incorporated in New Zealand under the Companies Act 1955:
    
    *   G section 458(2) of the Companies Act 1955 forbids the registration under that Act of a company having for its object, or its principal object, the carrying on in New Zealand of the business of banking and accordingly an Act of Parliament is the only means by which such a company may be permitted to be so registered:
    
    *   H a Bill providing for the cesser of incorporation in England of the Bank has been introduced into the Parliament of the United Kingdom:
    
    *   I the National Bank of New Zealand (Limited) Act 1873 will be inappropriate when the Bank becomes incorporated in New Zealand under the Companies Act 1955, and it is therefore necessary to repeal the National Bank of New Zealand (Limited) Act 1873 with effect from the time when the Bank becomes so incorporated in New Zealand:
    
    *   J the present authorised and issued capital of the Bank is £7,500,000, and for accounting purposes this amount was in 1979 converted to $NZ16,101,331:
    
    *   K it is considered desirable that from the commencement of the day on which the Bank becomes incorporated in New Zealand under the Companies Act 1955 the authorised and issued capital of the Bank should be deemed to be $NZ16,101,331 divided into 16,101,331 ordinary shares of $1 each:
    
    *   L the objects of this Bill cannot be achieved without the authority of Parliament.
    
    

##### 1 Short Title
    
*   This Act may be cited as the National Bank of New Zealand Act 1985\.

##### 2 Interpretation
    
*   In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,---
    
    _Bank_ means the body corporate known as The National Bank of New Zealand, Limited incorporated in England under the Companies Act 1862 and further incorporated in New Zealand under the National Bank of New Zealand (Limited) Act 1873
    
    _certificate of incorporation_ means the certificate of incorporation issued under [section 5(2)][7]
    
    _Registrar_ means the Registrar of Companies; and includes the District Registrar of Companies at Wellington
    
    _United Kingdom Bill_ means the Bill providing for the cesser of incorporation in England of the Bank that has been introduced into the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

##### 3 Act to bind the Crown

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the National Bank of New Zealand Act 1985\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 4 April 1985, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][15] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][16] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][17] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][18] and [17E][19] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
