*   #### Preamble
    
    (1) By deed dated 30 September 1838, Reverend A N Brown who was acting on behalf of the Church Mission Society purported to purchase land at Tauranga including Otamataha from tangata whenua:
    
    (2) That transaction has never been accepted by tangata whenua as a sale of the land to the Church Mission Society:
    
    (3) The Church Mission Society was awarded the land including Otamataha by Crown Grant in 1852:
    
    (4) On 28 September 1896, the residue of that land including Otamataha was transferred by the Church Mission Society to the New Zealand Mission Trust Board (the _Board_), a body incorporated under the Religious, Charitable, and Educational Trust Boards Incorporation Act 1884 (now the [Charitable Trusts Act 1957][11]) which held the assets of the Board on trusts for the spiritual benefit and spiritual instruction of Maori people in the North Island of New Zealand or failing that, the evangelisation of heathen races in any part of the world:
    
    (5) By deed dated 20 September 1998, the then trustees of the Board, in recognition of the manner and process by which the land was acquired from tangata whenua, resigned as trustees with respect to the remaining land and property of the Board in Tauranga including Otamataha and were replaced by new trustees representing the hapū of Ngati Tapu and Ngaitamarawaho (the _new trustees_):
    
    (6) The Waitangi Tribunal in its 2004 report _Te Raupatu o Tauranga Moana: Report on the Tauranga Confiscation Claims_, after considering the manner in which a Crown Grant for the land including Otamataha was awarded to the Church Mission Society in 1852, concluded at page 218:
    
    ""we find that Godfrey failed to ascertain and acknowledge the conditional nature of the transactions under Maori customary law and that he wrongly concluded that the CMS had fully and fairly purchased the whole of the area. The Crown, in accepting Godfrey's recommendation and finally awarding the CMS a Crown grant for the whole area, was therefore in breach of the Treaty principle of active protection."":
    
    (7) Despite this conclusion, [section 6(4A)(a)][12] of the Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975 prevents the Waitangi Tribunal from making any recommendation affecting the future ownership of Otamataha:
    
    (8) The new trustees wish to hold the residue of that land and the other property transferred to their control by the deed dated 20 September 1998 referred to in recital (5) of this preamble, on trusts which are for the benefit of the hapū of Ngati Tapu and Ngaitamarawaho, rather than on the trusts referred to in recital (4) of this preamble:
    
    (9) For that purpose, the new trustees wish to replace those existing trusts with a new trust deed:
    
    (10) The objects of this Act cannot be achieved without legislation:

The Parliament of New Zealand therefore enacts as follows:

##### 1 Title

The request will be deemed to be given on the Working Day that it is received or, if received on a day that is not a Working Day, on the next Working Day.
    
    

*   9 If the Trustees do not, within 15 Working Days from the date on which a request is deemed to have been given effectively under paragraph 8 of this Schedule, give Public Notice of the date, time, venue and agenda of a Special General Meeting to be held within 20 Working Days from the date of the Public Notice, the Trustees or Beneficiaries who requested the meeting may themselves convene a Special General Meeting, but any Special Meeting so convened shall be held within three calendar months of the date that the request was deemed to have been given under paragraph 8 of this Schedule.

##### Notice of Special General Meeting

*   10 Notice of a Special General Meeting convened under paragraph 6 of this Schedule shall be given in the same manner as for a notice of a General Meeting and shall include notice of the matter, resolution or issue proposed to be considered at the Special General Meeting in addition to any other matters required to be notified under this Deed.

*   11 For the avoidance of doubt, in the case of a Special General Meeting requested under paragraph 6(ii) of this Schedule, every person who signs a request pursuant to paragraph 6(ii) of this Schedule, is to receive not less than 20 Working Days' written notice of that Special General Meeting.

##### Cost of Special Meeting

*   12 Any reasonable expenses that are incurred by the Trustees or Beneficiaries, who convened a meeting under paragraph 9 of this Schedule as a result of the failure of the Trustees to convene a Special General Meeting which has been properly requested, are to be reimbursed by the Trust to the Trustees or Beneficiaries who requested the meeting.

##### Business at Special General Meeting

*   13 No business shall be transacted at any Special General Meeting other than the business expressly referred to in the notice calling that Special General Meeting.

#### _Proceedings at Meetings_

##### Quorum 

*   14 No business is to be transacted at any Annual General Meeting (or Special General Meeting) unless the required quorum is present at the time when the meeting proceeds to business.

*   15 The quorum for an Annual General Meeting, is:
        
    *   (i) a majority of the Trustees present in person; and 
    
    *   (ii) not less than 20 Beneficiaries, not being Trustees.
    
    

*   16 The quorum for a Special General Meeting, is:
        
    *   (i) a majority or more of the Trustees present in person; and
    
    *   (ii) not less than 50 Beneficiaries, not being Trustees.
    
    

*   17 If, within one hour of time appointed for an Annual General Meeting or Special General Meeting or meeting of Trustees, a quorum is not present, the meeting is to stand adjourned until the twentieth Working Day, or such other date as the Trustees may determine, following that adjournment in the case of an Annual General Meeting or Special General Meeting.

*   18 On that later day to which any meeting is adjourned under paragraph 17 of this Schedule, the meeting will be held at the same time and in the same place as the adjourned meeting unless the Trustees determine that the meeting shall be held at another time and place. In the case of an Annual General Meeting or Special General Meeting the Trustees shall forthwith following the adjournment publish a Public Notice specifying the date, time and place of the adjourned meeting.

*   19 If a quorum is not present within one hour from the time appointed for any adjourned meeting:
        
    *   (i) the Trustees present in person or by telephone in the case of a meeting of Trustees shall constitute a quorum; or
    
    *   (ii) the Trustees and Hapu Members present in person in the case of an Annual General Meeting or Special General Meeting shall constitute a quorum.
    
    

*   20 If the quorum at any adjourned meeting is determined by paragraph 19, then notwithstanding any other provision of the Deed, the majority required to pass any resolution shall be 90% of the Trustees present and 90% of the Beneficiaries present at that adjourned meeting.

##### Chairperson 

*   21 The Chairperson or, failing him or her, the Deputy Chairperson, will preside over and have control of every Annual General Meeting or Special General Meeting.

*   22 If there is no Chairperson or Deputy Chairperson present at the time appointed for holding a Annual General Meeting or Special General Meeting, or if either of those persons is unwilling to preside over the meeting, the Trustees present will choose one of their number to substitute as Chairperson for the meeting.

##### Proceedings at General Meetings and Special General Meetings

*   23 Any Beneficiary or Trustee may speak at any General Meeting or Special General Meeting during the period fixed for general debates at such meeting or any other period at such meeting which the Trustees resolve to permit general debate.

*   24 With the exception of a Special Resolution to terminate or dissolve the Trust, Trustees shall not be bound by a resolution passed at an Annual General Meeting and a Special General Meeting but will only be required to give consideration to any such resolution in administering the Trust and the Trust Fund and carrying out the Kaupapa of the Trust.

##### Unruly Meetings

*   25 If any Annual General Meeting or Special General Meeting becomes so unruly or disorderly that in the opinion of the Chairperson of the meeting the business of the meeting cannot be conducted in a proper and orderly manner, or if any meeting in the opinion of the Chairperson becomes unduly protracted, the Chairperson may, and without giving any reason, adjourn the meeting and may direct that any uncompleted item of business of which notice was given and which, in his or her opinion, required to be voted upon, is put to the vote without further discussion.
