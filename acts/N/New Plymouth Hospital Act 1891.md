An Act to authorise the Vesting of certain Education Reserves and a Portion of a Public Street within the Borough of New Plymouth in the Taranaki Hospital and Charitable Aid Board, for the Purposes of a Hospital.
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    WHEREAS, under the provisions of The Public Reserves Act 1854, all the unalienated lands within the Town of New Plymouth, including herein certain of the sections described in the Schedule [A][6] hereto, were, on the twentieth day of August, one thousand eight hundred and fifty-eight, granted to the Superintendent of the then Province of Taranaki upon trust as an endowment for public schools for general education: And whereas, notwithstanding such trust for educational purposes, the law was then such that the lands so reserved could be made available for other purposes of public utility from time to time found desirable by the Provincial Council: And whereas, by virtue of The Town of New Plymouth Compensation Ordinance 1859, and of The New Plymouth Exchanges Completion Act 1874, certain others of the sections described in the aforesaid Schedule became vested in the said Superintendent upon a similar trust: And whereas all the herein recited sections have, by operation of several Acts, and in particular by The Education Reserves Act 1877, become vested in the School Commissioners for the Provincial District of Taranaki: And whereas the New Plymouth Hospital was, in the year one thousand eight hundred and eighty-seven, erected on some of the sections described in Schedule [A][6], with the sanction (so far as they could legally give) of the Board of the School Commissioners for the Provincial District of Taranaki, and the rest of the land is absolutely required for the use of the hospital: And whereas that part of Bulteel Street, in the said town, which lies between Mount Edgcombe Street and the reserve known as Hospital Reserve H, terminates at the fence of the said reserve, and gives access only to the sections numbered four hundred and twenty-four, four hundred and twenty-five, four hundred and fifty-one, and four hundred and fifty, unoccupied except by the hospital buildings, which sections it is by this Act proposed to vest in the Hospital and Charitable Aid Board as an addition to the said Hospital Reserve H: And whereas no inconvenience to the public would be caused by closing that part of the said street: And whereas the Borough Council of New Plymouth approves of the closing of such part of the street, and is willing that the same shall be transferred to the Hospital Board, as they consider that a public benefit will accrue by this being done:

BE IT THEREFORE ENACTED by the General Assembly of New Zealand in Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:---

##### 1 Short Title
    
*   The Short Title of this Act is The New Plymouth Hospital Act 1891\.

##### 2 Education reserves in Town of New Plymouth transferred to Hospital and Charitable Aid Board
    
*   The several sections of land enumerated in Schedule [A][6] hereto, being education reserves within the Town of New Plymouth, and at present legally or equitably vested in the School Commissioners for the Provincial District of Taranaki, shall, on the coming into operation of this section, be vested for an estate in freehold in the Taranaki Hospital and Charitable Aid Board, to be held by the said Board for the purposes of the New Plymouth Hospital, subject, however, to any leases now existing affecting any of the said sections.

##### 3 Part of Bulteel Street closed and transferred to Hospital and Charitable Aid Board
    
*   All that part of Bulteel Street which lies between Mount Edgcombe Street and the reserve known as Hospital Reserve H shall henceforth cease to be a public street, and is hereby vested in the Taranaki Hospital and Charitable Aid Board, to be held by the Board for the purposes of the New Plymouth Hospital.

##### 4 Lands vested in School Commissioners as an equivalent
