    (4) A change of name by a board under this section shall not affect any rights or obligations of the board, or render defective any legal proceedings by or against the board, and any legal proceedings that may have been continued or commenced by or against it in its former name may be continued or commenced by or against it in its new name.
    
    Compare: 1955 No 63 s 32

    Compare: 1908 No 164 s 12

##### 21 Powers in respect of property

    *   (c) subject to the rules or other documents providing for the constitution of the board, purchase any property, whether situated in New Zealand or elsewhere, and apply any money for the time being held by the board for or towards any such purpose; and any property so purchased shall be held upon the same trusts as affected the money applied in payment for the property.
    
    (2) Any money or other property received in consequence of any such dedication or sale or exchange shall be held upon the same trusts as affected the property so dealt with, and any such money may be invested in any investments for the time being authorised by the [Trustee Act 1956][85] for the investment of trust funds.

    *   (a) a copy (certified by one of the trustees for the time being constituting the board or by a member of the committee or governing body of the society constituting the board, as a correct copy) of the relevant parts of every scheme, order, will, declaration of trust, and other document which (when read where necessary with the copies and documents already lodged with the Registrar) show the trusts as varied and the trusts on which the additional property is vested in the board; and
    
    *   (b) a statutory declaration by any such trustee or member setting forth the variation of the trusts or the trusts on which the additional property is held so far as they are not shown in any such scheme, order, will, declaration of trust, or other document.

*   This is a reprint of the Charitable Trusts Act 1957\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 July 2013, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][102] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][103] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][104] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][105] and [17E][106] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
