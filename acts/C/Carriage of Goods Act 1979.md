        provided that, where the freight payable under a contract of carriage is computed or adjusted upon a specified unit of bulk, weight, or measurement, references in this Act to unit of goods or unit shall be deemed, for the purposes of the carriage of goods pursuant to that contract, to be references to that specified unit:
    
    *   (b) in relation to goods contained in a container, means the container load of goods; and includes, where the container is provided by the contracting party, the container:

    *   (b) where he intentionally causes the loss or damage.
    
    

##### 7 Contracting out
    
*   The parties to a contract of carriage are free to make their own terms in respect of any matter to which any of [sections 10][12], and [18 to 27][23] apply; and, where they do so, the relevant section or sections shall, in relation to that matter, have effect subject to those express terms.

##### 8 Kinds of contract of carriage
    
*   (1) For the purpose of determining upon whom liability for the loss of or damage to any goods is to fall, every contract of carriage shall be one of the following kinds:
        
    *   (a) a contract for carriage _at owner's risk_, under which the carrier shall not be liable for the loss of or damage to any goods, except where the loss or damage is intentionally caused by the carrier:
    
    *   (b) a contract for carriage _at limited carrier's risk_, under which the carrier shall be liable for the loss of or damage to any goods in accordance with [sections 9][11], [14][16], and [15][17]:
    
    *   (c) a contract for carriage _at declared value risk_, under which the carrier shall be liable for the loss of or damage to any goods up to an amount specified in the contract and otherwise in accordance with [sections 9][11], [14][16], and [15][17]:
    
    *   (d) a contract for carriage _on declared terms_, under which the carrier shall be liable for the loss of or damage to any goods in accordance with the specific terms of the contract.
    
    (2) Subject to the succeeding provisions of this section, where in any contract of carriage the term ""at owner's risk"" or the term ""at limited carrier's risk"" or the term ""at declared value risk"" or the term ""on declared terms"" is used, the contract shall be deemed for the purposes of this Act to be one to which paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) or paragraph (c) or paragraph (d) (as the case may require) of subsection (1) applies.
    
    (3) Subject to the succeeding provisions of this section, the kind of contract of carriage to be entered into in a particular case is a matter for agreement between the parties.
    
    (4) Where the contract does not purport to be of a particular kind, it shall be deemed for the purposes of this Act to be a contract for carriage at limited carrier's risk.
    
    (5) No contract of carriage purporting to be a contract for carriage at owner's risk shall have effect as such (but instead shall have effect as a contract for carriage at limited carrier's risk) unless---
        
    *   (a) the contract is---
            
        *   (i) in writing; and
        
        *   (ii) expressed to be at owner's risk; and
        
        *   (iii) signed by the parties or their agents; or
        
        
    
    *   (b) before, or at the time when, the goods are accepted for carriage, the contracting party or his agent signs a statement in the following terms:
        
        > "These goods are to be carried at owner's risk. This means that the carrier will pay no compensation if the goods are lost or damaged, unless he intentionally loses or damages them."
        
        For the purposes of this paragraph, that statement may be included in the consignment note or any other document relating to the carriage, but in that case the statement shall be conspicuous and shall be separately signed by the contracting party or his agent.
    
    (6) No contract of carriage purporting to be a contract at declared value risk shall have effect as such (but instead shall have effect as a contract for carriage at limited carrier's risk) unless the contract is in writing.
    
    (7) No contract of carriage purporting to be a contract for carriage on declared terms shall have effect as such (but instead shall have effect as a contract for carriage at limited carrier's risk) unless the contract is---
        
    *   (a) freely negotiated between the parties; and
    
    *   (b) in writing; and
    
    *   (c) signed by the parties or their agents.
    
    (8) Where, in any proceeding, the question of whether any contract of carriage was or was not freely negotiated is in issue, the court in determining that question shall have regard to the following matters:
        
    *   (a) the respective bargaining strengths of the parties:
    
    *   (b) the course of dealing between the parties in respect of the particular transaction in question, and any other transactions between them:
    
    *   (c) the value of the transaction:
    
    *   (d) any extraordinary features of the goods to be carried or the route over which they are to be carried:
    
    *   (e) any other matters that the court considers may properly be taken into account,---
    
    and either party may adduce evidence relating to any such matter.
    
    (9) No contract of carriage at owner's risk or at declared value risk shall have effect as such (but instead shall have effect as a contract for carriage at limited carrier's risk) unless the amount by which the freight charged by the contracting carrier under the contract differs from the amount that he would have charged for the same carriage at limited carrier's risk is fair and reasonable, having regard to the difference in the risk actually undertaken by the carrier and the risk that he would have undertaken if the carriage had been at limited carrier's risk.
    
    (10) For the purposes of subsection (9), any rate of freight prescribed by or under any enactment in respect of any mode of carriage pursuant to any kind of contract of carriage shall be deemed to be a fair and reasonable rate to charge for such carriage.
    
    (11) Any contract of carriage entered into by a contracting carrier with an actual carrier, or between actual carriers, may be of any kind, regardless of the kind of contract that subsists between the contracting carrier and the contracting party; but subsections (5) to (8) shall not apply in respect of any such contract.
    
    (12) The provisions of [sections 9][11], [14][16], and [15][17] apply to contracts for carriage at limited carrier's risk and to contracts for carriage at declared value risk.
    
    (13) [Sections 9(1)][11], [14][16], and [15][17] do not apply to contracts for carriage at owner's risk or to contracts for carriage on declared terms.
    
    (14) Notwithstanding anything in [section 7][8], the provisions of subsections (2) to (7) of [section 9][11] apply to contracts for carriage at owner's risk and to contracts for carriage on declared terms, subject to any express term in the contract.

*   (1) Subject to the other provisions of this Act, a contracting carrier is liable as such to the contracting party for the loss of or damage to any goods occurring while he is responsible for the goods in accordance with the succeeding provisions of this section, whether or not the loss or damage is caused wholly or partly by him or by any actual carrier.
    
    (2) The responsibility of the contracting carrier for goods begins when the goods are accepted for carriage in accordance with the contract.

        *   (i) when they are tendered to the consignee in the manner expressed or implied in the contract; or
        
        *   (ii) where any amount by way of freight is due and payable to or on behalf of the contracting carrier at any time before, or at the time at which, the goods are to be tendered to the consignee under the contract and that amount has not been paid in full, when the contracting carrier or (as the case may require) the last actual carrier is capable of tendering the goods to the consignee in accordance with the contract and gives notice to any person liable to pay the amount or (as the case may require) the balance of the amount that he is so capable:
        
        
    
    *   (b) in a case where the goods are to be collected by the consignee,---

        *   (ii) on the expiry of the 5th day (excluding any day on which the carrier's premises are not open for the collection of goods) after the date on which the contracting carrier or (as the case may require) the last actual carrier notifies the consignee that the goods are available for collection.
        
        
    
    (4) In any case where, at the time when the contracting carrier or (as the case may require) the last actual carrier is able to tender the goods to the consignee in accordance with the contract, the consignee's whereabouts are unknown to that carrier, the responsibility of the contracting carrier for the goods ends when he or (as the case may require) the last actual carrier has taken reasonable steps to find the consignee and notify him of the matters referred to in paragraph (a)(ii) or (as the case may require) paragraph (b)(ii) of subsection (3).
    
    (5) No notice referred to in subsection (3)(a)(ii) shall take effect until it is received by the person liable to pay the freight.
    
    (6) Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions of this section, the responsibility of a contracting carrier who contracts for the carriage of goods to a destination outside New Zealand ends for the purposes of this Act at the time when the international carriage of those goods begins.
    
    (7) Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions of this section, the responsibility of a contracting carrier who contracts for the carriage of goods from a destination outside New Zealand to a destination in New Zealand begins for the purposes of this Act at the time when the international carriage of those goods ends.
    
    Compare: 1948 No 66 s 7

##### 10 Liability of actual carrier
    
*   (1) The provisions of this section apply, subject to the other provisions of this Act, where a contract of carriage is to be or is performed wholly or partly by 1 or more actual carriers other than the contracting carrier (whether or not the contracting carrier himself performs part of the carriage).
    
    (2) In any case to which this section applies where 1 actual carrier is involved, that carrier is, subject to the terms of his contract with the contracting carrier, liable as such to the contracting carrier for the loss of or damage to any goods occurring while the actual carrier is separately responsible for the goods in accordance with subsection (6), whether or not the loss or damage is caused wholly or partly by the actual carrier.
    
    (3) In any case to which this section applies where more than 1 actual carrier is involved,---
        
    *   (a) subject to subsection (4), the actual carriers are, subject to the terms of their respective contracts, jointly liable as such to the contracting carrier for the loss of or damage to any goods occurring while the actual carriers are jointly responsible for the goods in accordance with subsection (5), whether or not the loss or damage is caused wholly or partly by the actual carriers or any of them:
    
    *   (b) each actual carrier is, subject to the terms of his contract, separately liable as such to the contracting carrier for the loss of or damage to any goods occurring while he is separately responsible for the goods in accordance with subsection (6), whether or not the loss or damage is caused wholly or partly by the actual carrier.
    
    (4) No actual carrier is liable under subsection (3)(a) if he proves that the loss or damage occurred otherwise than while he was separately responsible for the goods in accordance with subsection (6).
    
    (5) For the purposes of subsection (3)(a), the actual carriers are jointly responsible for the goods from the time when the goods (or the container, package, pallet, item of baggage, or any other thing in or on which the goods are believed to be) are accepted for carriage until the time when the contracting carrier's responsibility ends in accordance with subsection (3) or subsection (4) of [section 9][11].
    
    (6) For the purposes of subsections (2) to (4), each actual carrier is separately responsible for the goods from the time when the goods (or the container, package, pallet, item of baggage, or any other thing in or on which the goods are believed to be) are accepted by him for carriage until the time---
        
    *   (a) when they are duly tendered by him to the next actual carrier in accordance with the contract of carriage; or
    
    *   (b) in the case of the last actual carrier, when the contracting carrier's responsibility ends in accordance with subsection (3) or subsection (4) of [section 9][11].
    
    (7) For the purposes of subsection (3)(a), the actual carriers shall be liable in proportion to the amount of freight or other consideration payable to each of the actual carriers for the carriage performed by him.
    
    (8) For the purposes of subsection (7), where the contracting carrier himself performs any part of the carriage, the amount of freight or other consideration payable to him shall be the difference between the total amount payable under the contract of carriage and the aggregate amount payable to the actual carriers.
    
    (9) For the purposes of subsections (7) and (8), where any actual carrier (in this subsection referred to as the _secondary actual carrier_) performs any part of the carriage pursuant to a contract with any other actual carrier (in this subsection referred to as the _primary actual carrier_) (and not pursuant to a contract with the contracting carrier), the amount of the freight or other consideration payable to the primary actual carrier shall be the difference between the amount actually payable to him and the amount payable by him to the secondary actual carrier.

##### 11 Rights of contracting party where contracting carrier insolvent or cannot be found
    
*   (1) Notwithstanding anything in [section 10][12], where the contracting carrier is liable to the contracting party for the loss of or damage to any goods but the contracting carrier is insolvent or cannot with reasonable diligence be found, the contracting party shall be entitled to the same rights (if any) against the actual carrier as the contracting carrier has under section 10(3)(b).
    
    (2) Where the liquidator or assignee in bankruptcy of an insolvent contracting carrier brings any proceeding against an actual carrier in respect of any right referred to in subsection (1), the sum recovered from the actual carrier, less all costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the liquidator or assignee in bringing and prosecuting the proceeding and not recovered by him from the actual carrier, shall be held by the liquidator or assignee upon the following trusts:
        
    *   (a) for or towards the payment of the whole of the sum payable by the contracting carrier to the contracting party in respect of the loss of or damage to the goods:

    *   (b) if judgment in the proceeding is awarded against the actual carrier, that judgment shall be an absolute bar to the bringing by the contracting carrier, or by any person claiming through the contracting carrier, of any proceeding to enforce the same right.
    
    (4) This section applies notwithstanding anything in the [Companies Act 1993][45] or the [Insolvency Act 2006][46] or any other enactment.

*   (1) A carrier is not liable as such with respect to baggage that is left in his custody pending his acceptance of it for carriage, or pending its collection from him after the completion of the carriage.
    
    (2) Nothing in [section 8][9], or in subsections (1) to (5) of [section 9][11], or in [sections 10][12], [11][13], and [13][15] shall apply to the carriage of hand baggage.
    
    (3) Subject to subsection (2), in respect of the carriage of hand baggage and checked baggage, the provisions of this Act shall apply, with the necessary modifications, as if that carriage were or were to be performed pursuant to a contract of carriage of goods.
    
    (4) A carrier is liable as such for the loss of or damage to any hand baggage occurring during the period in which the passenger is on board the mode of transport or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking, if the loss or damage is caused wholly or partly by the negligence or wilful default of the carrier.
    
    (5) Without limiting [section 14][16], if, in respect of the loss of or damage to any hand baggage, the carrier proves that the loss or damage was contributed to by the negligence or wilful default of the passenger, the court may, in accordance with the provisions of the [Contributory Negligence Act 1947][49], exonerate the carrier from any part of his liability.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Carriage of Goods Act 1979\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 3 December 2007, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][51] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][52] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][53] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][54] and [17E][55] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
