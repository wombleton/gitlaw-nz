    *   (a) may squash the conviction; and

    *   (c) on the finding of the Court Martial it appears to the court that the Court Martial must have been satisfied of facts that proved the appellant guilty of that other offence.
    
    (2) The court may, instead of allowing or dismissing the appeal,---
        
    *   (a) substitute for the finding of the Court Martial a finding of guilty of that other offence; and

##### 9B Variation of conviction so as to attract different sentence
    
*   (1) Where an appellant has been convicted of an offence committed under circumstances involving the higher of 2 degrees of punishment, and it appears to the court that the Court Martial ought to have convicted him of the offence under circumstances involving the lower degree of punishment, the court may, instead of allowing or dismissing the appeal, substitute for the conviction recorded by the Court Martial a conviction for the offence as being committed under circumstances involving the lower degree of punishment.
    
    (2) Where the court exercises the power conferred by subsection (1), it may pass on the appellant, in substitution for the sentence passed on him by the Court Martial, such sentence as it thinks proper being a sentence warranted by the [Armed Forces Discipline Act 1971][58] for the offence specified or involved in the substituted conviction, but not being a sentence of greater severity than that actually passed by the Court Martial.

*   (1) A person who is acquitted by the Court Martial on account of his insanity shall have the same right of appeal against the finding of the Court Martial as he would if the finding had been a conviction.
    
    (2) If on any such appeal the finding of insanity is challenged by the appellant, and the court is of the opinion that the finding ought not to stand, and is satisfied that in the absence of such a finding the proper finding would have been that the appellant was guilty of an offence (whether that with which he was charged or any offence of which he could have been convicted at the trial), the court shall substitute for the acquittal a conviction for the offence. Thereupon the court shall have the same powers of sentencing or otherwise dealing with the appellant, and such other powers, as the Court Martial would have had if the substituted conviction had been recorded at the trial.
    
    (3) Except as provided in subsection (2), on any such appeal the court may---

    (4) No such appeal shall be allowed by reason only of the fact that the appellant ought to have been acquitted of the offence charged, if the court is of the opinion that, but for the insanity, the proper finding would have been that he was guilty of some other offence; but the court may direct that the other offence be substituted, in the record of the finding, for the offence charged.
    
    (5) Unless the court otherwise directs, the term of any sentence passed by it pursuant to subsection (2) shall begin to run from the time when it would have begun to run if passed on the date on which the finding appealed against was made.

    (4) A discharge under subsection (3) does not amount to an acquittal.
    
    (5) In the case of an appeal against a finding relating to the appellant's fitness to stand trial, the court must (except where the appellant has been discharged under subsection (3)) consider the evidence of 2 qualified medical practitioners (within the meaning of [section 187(1)][84] of the Armed Forces Discipline Act 1971), and confirm or quash the finding relating to the appellant's mental impairment.
    
    (6) If the court is satisfied that the appellant is mentally impaired, the court must---
        
    *   (a) give the appellant and the respondent an opportunity to be heard and to present evidence as to whether the appellant is unfit to stand trial; and
    
    *   (b) confirm or quash the finding relating to the appellant's fitness to stand trial.
    
    (7) If the result of the appeal is that the appellant is fit to stand trial, the court must give written notice of that fact to the Director of Military Prosecutions, who may then lay before the Registrar the charge sheet that, in accordance with [section 101F(c)][85] of the Armed Forces Discipline Act 1971, he or she has previously certified in respect of the appellant.

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Court Martial Appeals Act 1953\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 5 March 2012, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][126] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][127] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][128] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][129] and [17E][130] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
