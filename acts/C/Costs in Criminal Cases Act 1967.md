An Act to amend the law relating to the payment of costs in criminal cases

##### 1 Short Title and commencement
    
*   (1) This Act may be cited as the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967\.
    
    (2) This Act shall come into force on 1 April 1968\.

##### 2 Interpretation
    
*   In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,---
    
    _costs_ means any expenses properly incurred by a party in carrying out a prosecution, carrying on a defence, or in making or defending an appeal
    
    _court_ means any court exercising any jurisdiction in criminal cases
    
    _Crown organisation_ has the same meaning as in [section 4][19] of the Crown Organisations (Criminal Liability) Act 2002
    
    _defendant_ means any person charged with an offence.
    
    Section 2 **Crown organisation**: inserted, on 18 October 2002, by  [section 19][20] of the Crown Organisations (Criminal Liability) Act 2002 (2002 No 37).

##### 3 Act to bind the Crown
    
*   This Act shall bind the Crown.

##### 4 Costs of the prosecutor
    
*   (1) Where any defendant is convicted by any court of any offence, the court may, subject to any regulations made under this Act, order him to pay such sum as it thinks just and reasonable towards the costs of the prosecution.
    
    (2) Where on the arrest of that person any money was taken from him the court may in its discretion order the whole or any part of the money to be applied to any such payment.
    
    (3) Where the court convicts any person and the informant or prosecutor has not prepaid any fees of court, the court may order the person convicted to pay the fees of court.
    
    (4) Any costs allowed under this section shall be specified in the conviction and may be recovered in the same manner as a fine.
    
    (5) If subsection (1) or subsection (3) applies and the defendant or person convicted is a Crown organisation convicted of an offence against the Building Act 1991, the [Building Act 2004][21], the [Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992][22], or the [Resource Management Act 1991][23], any costs and fees awarded must be paid from the funds of that organisation.
    
    Compare: 1957 No 87 [s 72(1), (4), (6)][24]; 1961 No 43 [s 402(1), (4)][25]
    
    Section 4(5): inserted, on 18 October 2002, by [section 20][26] of the Crown Organisations (Criminal Liability) Act 2002 (2002 No 37).
    
    Section 4(5): amended, on 1 October 2009, by [section 162(2)][27] of the Resource Management (Simplifying and Streamlining) Amendment Act 2009 (2009 No 31).
    
    Section 4(5): amended, on 31 March 2005, by [section 414][28] of the Building Act 2004 (2004 No 72).

##### 5 Costs of successful defendant
    
*   (1) Where any defendant is acquitted of an offence or where the information charging him with an offence is dismissed or withdrawn, whether upon the merits or otherwise, or where he is discharged under [section 184F][29] of the Summary Proceedings Act 1957 the court may, subject to any regulations made under this Act, order that he be paid such sum as it thinks just and reasonable towards the costs of his defence.
    
    (2) Without limiting or affecting the court's discretion under subsection (1), it is hereby declared that the court, in deciding whether to grant costs and the amount of any costs granted, shall have regard to all relevant circumstances and in particular (where appropriate) to---
        
    *   (a) whether the prosecution acted in good faith in bringing and continuing the proceedings:
    
    *   (b) whether at the commencement of the proceedings the prosecution had sufficient evidence to support the conviction of the defendant in the absence of contrary evidence:
    
    *   (c) whether the prosecution took proper steps to investigate any matter coming into its hands which suggested that the defendant might not be guilty:
    
    *   (d) whether generally the investigation into the offence was conducted in a reasonable and proper manner:
    
    *   (e) whether the evidence as a whole would support a finding of guilt but the information was dismissed on a technical point:
    
    *   (f) whether the information was dismissed because the defendant established (either by the evidence of witnesses called by him or by the cross-examination of witnesses for the prosecution or otherwise) that he was not guilty:
    
    *   (g) whether the behaviour of the defendant in relation to the acts or omissions on which the charge was based and to the investigation and proceedings was such that a sum should be paid towards the costs of his defence.
    
    (3) There shall be no presumption for or against the granting of costs in any case.
    
    (4) No defendant shall be granted costs under this section by reason only of the fact that he has been acquitted or discharged or that any information charging him with an offence has been dismissed or withdrawn.
    
    (5) No defendant shall be refused costs under this section by reason only of the fact that the proceedings were properly brought and continued.

##### 6 Costs of convicted defendant
    
*   Where any defendant is convicted but the court is of the opinion that the prosecution involved a difficult or important point of law and that in the special circumstances of the case it is proper that he should receive costs in respect of the arguing of that point of law, the court may, subject to any regulations made under this Act, order that he be paid such sum as it considers just and reasonable towards those costs.

    *   (b) if the prosecution was not conducted by or on behalf of the Crown, be paid by the informant and may be recovered from him as a debt, and any such order made by a District Court shall be enforceable as if it were an order made under [Part 2][31] of the Summary Proceedings Act 1957\.
    
    (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1) where a court is of the opinion that any person has acted negligently or in bad faith in bringing, continuing, or conducting a prosecution it may, in any order made under [section 5][6], direct that the defendant's costs shall be paid by---
        
    *   (a) the government department, officer of the Crown, local authority, or public body on whose behalf that person was acting; or
    
    *   (b) if he was not so acting, by that person personally,---
    
    and in any such case costs shall not be paid under subsection (1) but shall be paid by, and may be recovered as a debt from, the government department, officer of the Crown, local authority, public body, or person specified in the order.
    
    (3) If an order under [section 5][6] or [section 6][7] relating to the payment of costs is made in favour of a Crown organisation that was prosecuted for an offence against the Building Act 1991, the [Building Act 2004][21], the [Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992][22], or the [Resource Management Act 1991][23], those costs must be paid to that Crown organisation.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 October 2009, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][51] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][52] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][53] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][54] and [17E][55] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
