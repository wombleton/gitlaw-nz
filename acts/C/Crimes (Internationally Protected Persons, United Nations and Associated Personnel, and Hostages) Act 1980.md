        *   (iv) being an accessory after the fact to that crime; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) each crime described in [section 5][8] or [section 6][9],---
    
    is, if not already described in the treaty, deemed to be an offence described in any extradition treaty concluded before the commencement of the [Crimes (Internationally Protected Persons and Hostages) Amendment Act 1998][45] and for the time being in force between New Zealand and any country that is a party to the 1994 Convention.
    
    (2) If under subsection (1) a crime is deemed to be an offence described in an extradition treaty, no person may be surrendered for that crime in accordance with the provisions of the [Extradition Act 1999][42] if the alleged act or omission occurred before the commencement of the [Crimes (Internationally Protected Persons and Hostages) Amendment Act 1998][45].

*   (1) Without limiting the grounds on which surrender must or may be refused under the [Extradition Act 1999][42], a court in New Zealand must not order the surrender, or the detention for the purposes of surrender, of a person to another country in respect of an act or omission that amounts to a crime against any of [sections 3 to 8][6] if the Attorney-General certifies that the case is being or is about to be considered to determine whether or not proceedings should be brought in New Zealand against that person in respect of the act or omission.
    
    (2) If, in any case to which subsection (1) applies, it is subsequently determined that proceedings should not be brought in New Zealand against the person in respect of the act or omission, the Attorney-General must advise the court accordingly, and the court must proceed with the matter as if the Attorney-General's certificate had never been given.
    
    (3) Without limiting the grounds on which surrender must or may be refused under the [Extradition Act 1999][42], a person must not be surrendered to another country if it appears that the person's position may be prejudiced because communication with the person by the appropriate authorities of the country that is entitled in international law to exercise rights of protection in respect to the person cannot be effected.

    (2) A person charged with a crime against any of those provisions may be arrested, or a warrant for his arrest may be issued and executed, and he may be remanded in custody or on bail, notwithstanding that the consent of the Attorney-General to the institution of a prosecution for the crime has not been obtained, but no further proceedings shall be taken until that consent has been obtained.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Crimes (Internationally Protected Persons, United Nations and Associated Personnel, and Hostages) Act 1980\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 7 July 2010, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][82] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][83] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][1] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][84] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][1] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][85] and [17E][86] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][1] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][1] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
