##### 5 Governor to be satisfied of ownership before vesting railway
    
*   Before the issue of any Order in Council under this Act vesting any branch railway in a company, if there is any doubt or dispute about the ownership of such railway, the Governor shall as soon as may be appoint one of the Judges of the High Court to be a Commissioner under this Act for the purposes and with the powers hereinafter mentioned:---

    (2) The Commissioner shall have the same powers as are given to Commissioners by The Commissioners' Powers Act 1867\.
    
    (3) The award of the Commissioner in writing under his hand shall be final and conclusive, and shall be sufficient warrant to the Governor for the issue of an Order in Council vesting the railway in the persons declared by the award to be the owners thereof.
    
    The reference to the ""High Court"" was substituted, as from 1 April 1980, for a reference to the ""Supreme Court"" pursuant to section [12][7] Judicature Amendment Act 1979 (1979 No 124).
