    *   (a) that a restraining order was earlier made in relation to the same property; and
    
    *   (b) that the restraining order has been in place for a period of at least 1 year; and

    (2) The circumstances the Court may have regard to under subsection (1) include, without limitation,---
        
    *   (a) the use that is ordinarily made, or was intended to be made, of the property that is, or is proposed to be, the subject of the assets forfeiture order; and

#### Making profit forfeiture order

##### 53 Value of benefit presumed to be value in application
    
*   (1) If the Commissioner proves, on the balance of probabilities, that the respondent has, in the relevant period of criminal activity, unlawfully benefited from significant criminal activity, the value of that benefit is presumed to be the value stated in---
        
    *   (a) the application under [section 52(c)][78]; or
    
    *   (b) if the case requires, the amended application.
    
    (2) The presumption stated in subsection (1) may be rebutted by the respondent on the balance of probabilities.

##### 54 High Court must determine maximum recoverable amount
    
*   (1) Before the High Court makes a profit forfeiture order, the Court must determine the maximum recoverable amount by---
        
    *   (a) taking the value of the benefit determined in accordance with [section 53][80]; and
    
    *   (b) deducting from that the value of any property forfeited to the Crown as a result of an assets forfeiture order made in relation to the same significant criminal activity to which the profit forfeiture order relates.
    
    (2) In determining the value of any property under subsection (1)(b), the Court may, at its own discretion or at the request of either party to the proceedings, seek an independent valuation as to the value of the property.
    
    (3) If an assets forfeiture order relating to a determination under this section is discharged on appeal, the Court may, on application by the Commissioner, vary the maximum recoverable amount in the profit forfeiture order to reflect that there is no longer a deduction to be made on account of the assets forfeiture order.

    *   (c) the property that is to be disposed of in accordance with [section 83(1)][122], being property in which the respondent has, or is treated as having, interests.
    
    (3) Subsections (1) and (2) are subject to [section 56][83].
    
    (4) A profit forfeiture order is enforceable as an order made as a result of civil proceedings instituted by the Crown against the person to recover a debt due to it, and the maximum recoverable amount is recoverable from the respondent by the Official Assignee on behalf of the Crown as a debt due to the Crown.

##### 56 Exclusion of respondent's property from profit forfeiture order because of undue hardship
    
*   (1) The High Court may, on an application made by the respondent before a profit forfeiture order is made, exclude certain property from being able to be realised under [section 55(2)(c)][82] if it considers that, having regard to all of the circumstances, undue hardship is reasonably likely to be caused to the respondent if the property were realised.
    
    (2) The circumstances the Court may have regard to under subsection (1) include, without limitation,---

    *   (a) after realising other property under that section there is still a debt owed to the Crown under [section 55(4)][82]; and
    
    *   (b) the respondent agrees to realise the excluded property in order to pay all or part of that debt.
    
    

##### 57 Profit forfeiture order if respondent has absconded
    
*   (1) The High Court may make a profit forfeiture order even if the respondent has absconded.
    
    (2) In subsection (1), a respondent has absconded if the respondent---
        
    *   (a) is unable to be found; or
    
    *   (b) by reason of being outside New Zealand, is not amenable to justice.
    
    

##### 58 Court may treat effective control over property as interest in property
    
*   (1) If the High Court is satisfied that a respondent has effective control over property, the Court may, on an application made by the Commissioner, order that the property is to be treated as though the respondent had an interest in the property specified by the Court.
    
    (2) An order under subsection (1) may---
        
    *   (a) be made even if the respondent has no interest in the property; and
    
    *   (b) specify an interest that differs from the interest that the respondent has in the property.
    
    (3) Without limiting the generality of subsections (1) and (2), the Court may have regard to---
        
    *   (a) shareholdings in, debentures over, or directorships of, any company that has an interest (whether direct or indirect) in the property; and
    
    *   (b) any trust that has a relationship to the property; and
    
    *   (c) family, domestic, and business relationships between persons having an interest in the property or in companies of the kind referred to in paragraph (a) or in trusts of the kind referred to in paragraph (b), and any other persons.
    
    (4) Property that is subject to an order under subsection (1) may be included in any profit forfeiture order and in any restraining order that is made against the respondent.
    
    (5) If the Commissioner applies for an order under subsection (1),---
        
    *   (a) the Commissioner must, so far as it is practicable to do so, serve notice of the application on the respondent and on any person who, to the knowledge of the Commissioner, has an interest in the property; and
    
    *   (b) the respondent and any other person who claims an interest in the property are entitled to appear and to adduce evidence at the hearing of the application.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Criminal Proceeds (Recovery) Act 2009\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 July 2013, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][499] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][500] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][501] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][502] and [17E][503] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
