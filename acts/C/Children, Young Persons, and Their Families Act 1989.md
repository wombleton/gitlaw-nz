#### Principles

##### 208 Principles
    
*   Subject to [section 5][9], any court which, or person who, exercises any powers conferred by or under this Part or [Part 5][467] or [sections 351 to 360][509] shall be guided by the following principles:
        
    *   (a) the principle that, unless the public interest requires otherwise, criminal proceedings should not be instituted against a child or young person if there is an alternative means of dealing with the matter:
    
    *   (b) the principle that criminal proceedings should not be instituted against a child or young person solely in order to provide any assistance or services needed to advance the welfare of the child or young person, or his or her family, whanau, or family group:
    
    *   (c) the principle that any measures for dealing with offending by children or young persons should be designed---
            
        *   (i) to strengthen the family, whanau, hapu, iwi, and family group of the child or young person concerned; and
        
        *   (ii) to foster the ability of families, whanau, hapu, iwi, and family groups to develop their own means of dealing with offending by their children and young persons:
        
        
    
    *   (d) the principle that a child or young person who commits an offence should be kept in the community so far as that is practicable and consonant with the need to ensure the safety of the public:
    
    *   (e) the principle that a child's or young person's age is a mitigating factor in determining---
            
        *   (i) whether or not to impose sanctions in respect of offending by a child or young person; and
        
        *   (ii) the nature of any such sanctions:
        
        
    
    *   (f) the principle that any sanctions imposed on a child or young person who commits an offence should---
            
        *   (i) take the form most likely to maintain and promote the development of the child or young person within his or her family, whanau, hapu, and family group; and
        
        *   (ii) take the least restrictive form that is appropriate in the circumstances:
        
        
    
    *   (fa) the principle that any measures for dealing with offending by a child or young person should so far as it is practicable to do so address the causes underlying the child's or young person's offending:
    
    *   (g) the principle that---
            
        *   (i) in the determination of measures for dealing with offending by children or young persons, consideration should be given to the interests and views of any victims of the offending (for example, by encouraging the victims to participate in the processes under this Part for dealing with offending); and
        
        *   (ii) any measures should have proper regard for the interests of any victims of the offending and the impact of the offending on them:
        
        
    
    *   (h) the principle that the vulnerability of children and young persons entitles a child or young person to special protection during any investigation relating to the commission or possible commission of an offence by that child or young person.
    
    Section 208(fa): inserted, on 1 October 2010, by [section 6(1)][809] of the Children, Young Persons, and Their Families (Youth Courts Jurisdiction and Orders) Amendment Act 2010 (2010 No 2).

#### Warnings and formal Police cautions

##### 209 Consideration of warning as alternative to prosecution
    
*   Where an enforcement officer is considering whether to institute criminal proceedings against a child or young person for an offence alleged or admitted to have been committed by that child or young person, that officer shall consider whether it would be sufficient to warn the child or young person, unless a warning is clearly inappropriate having regard to the seriousness of the offence and the nature and number of previous offences committed by the child or young person.

##### 210 Administration of warning
    
*   Where, in respect of any offence alleged or admitted to have been committed by a child or young person, an enforcement officer decides that it would be sufficient to warn that child or young person, that officer may warn the child or young person, or arrange for any other person to warn the child or young person.

    *   (a) where practicable, the caution shall be given at a Police station:

##### 434 Principal Youth Court Judge
    
*   (1) The Governor-General must, on the advice of the Attorney-General, appoint a Principal Youth Court Judge.
    
    (2) The appointment must be for a period of 8 years, and the person is not eligible for reappointment as Principal Youth Court Judge.
    
    (3) A person's appointment as Principal Youth Court Judge ceases if he or she ceases to hold office as a District Court Judge.
    
    (4) With the prior approval of the Governor-General, the Principal Youth Court Judge may resign that office but continue in office as a District Court Judge.
    
    (5) To avoid doubt, a person does not cease to hold office as a District Court Judge solely because the term of the person's appointment as Principal Youth Court Judge has come to an end.
    
    (6) Despite subsection (2), the Principal Youth Court Judge continues in office until his or her successor comes into office.
    
    (7) The Principal Youth Court Judge is responsible for ensuring the orderly and expeditious discharge of the business of the court in consultation with the Chief District Court Judge.

    (2) For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that a Family Court Judge may be designated as a Youth Court Judge.
    
    (3) A person shall not be designated a Youth Court Judge unless that person is a suitable person to deal with matters within the jurisdiction of a Youth Court by virtue of that person's training, experience, and personality and understanding of the significance and importance of different cultural perspectives and values.
    
    (4) A Family Court Judge shall not be designated as a Youth Court Judge without the concurrence of the Principal Family Court Judge.

##### 435A Stationing of Judges and sittings of courts
    
*   (1) Each Youth Court Judge must be stationed in the town, and must sit in the court, that may from time to time be determined by the Principal Youth Court Judge.
    
    (2) Despite subsection (1), the fact that a Youth Court Judge sits in any particular court is conclusive evidence of the Judge's authority to do so, and no exercise of any jurisdiction or power by a Youth Court Judge may be questioned on the ground that the Judge was not stationed in the town or authorised to sit in the court where he or she exercised the jurisdiction or power.
    
    (3) Sittings of a Youth Court for the dispatch of its business must be held on the days and times that may be appointed by the Judge exercising the jurisdiction of the court at the place at which the sittings are held.
    
    (4) However, the days appointed for regular sittings of a Youth Court are subject to the approval of the Principal Youth Court Judge.
    
    (5) In exercising his or her powers under this section, the Principal Youth Court Judge must consult with the Chief District Court Judge.

    (2) The fact that a District Court Judge exercises jurisdiction in a Youth Court under this section shall be conclusive evidence of the authority of that District Court Judge to do so, and no act done by that District Court Judge while acting as such shall, in any proceedings, be questioned on the ground that the occasion for so acting had not arisen or had ceased.
