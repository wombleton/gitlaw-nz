*   (1) Subject to this Part, where an assessment has been made of a person's taxable income under the Income Tax Act 1976 (other than an assessment made under section 21 of that Act or the [Tax Administration Act 1994][480] (other than an assessment made under [section 106][552] of that Act)) for any income year, then, in making a formula assessment, the person's taxable income under the relevant one of those Acts for that income year is, for the purposes of this Act, to be taken to be that taxable income as so assessed or as last so assessed, as the case may be, before the making of the formula assessment.
    
    (2) Subsection (1) has effect despite the making, after the making of the formula assessment, of an amendment under the Income Tax Act 1976 or the [Tax Administration Act 1994][480] to the relevant assessment of the person's taxable income under the relevant one of those Acts (whether or not the amendment is made because of an objection in relation to the assessment).
    
    (3) Subsection (2) does not apply in relation to the person in any case where---
        
    *   (a) the taxable income of that person assessed under the Income Tax Act 1976 or the [Tax Administration Act 1994][480] in any amended assessment made after the making of a formula assessment for a child support year is more than $500 in excess of, or less than, the taxable income of that person assessed, or last assessed, before the making of the formula assessment; and
    
    *   (b) notice of the amended assessment is issued by the Commissioner on or before the last day in the child support year;---
    
    and, where such an amendment is made, the person's taxable income under the relevant Act for that income year is to be taken to be, and always to have been, the person's taxable income for the income year as last so assessed under the relevant Act, and the Commissioner shall amend the formula assessment accordingly.
    
    (4) Subsection (2) does not apply in relation to the person in any case where the reason (or one of the reasons) that the amendment was made was because, in the opinion of the Commissioner, the return of income made by the person under the Income Tax Act 1976 or the [Tax Administration Act 1994][480] was fraudulent or wilfully misleading or omitted all mention of income which is of a particular nature or was derived from a particular source, and, where such an amendment is made, the person's taxable income under the relevant Act for that income year is to be taken to be, and always to have been, the person's taxable income for the income year as last so assessed under the relevant Act.
    
    (5) Where---
        
    *   (a) the Commissioner, applying subsection (1), assesses the annual rate of child support payable by a liable parent; and
    
    *   (b) after the making of the formula assessment, an amendment is made under the Income Tax Act 1976 or the [Tax Administration Act 1994][480] to the relevant assessment of the taxable income of the liable parent for the last relevant income year; and
    
    *   (c) neither subsection (3) nor subsection (4) applies in relation to the amendment,---
    
    then, in subsequently amending the formula assessment other than for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions of [section 39(3)][55] of this Act, the amendment made under the Income Tax Act 1976 or the [Tax Administration Act 1994][480] is to be disregarded.
    
    (6) Where---
        
    *   (a) notice of an assessment (including an amended assessment) of a person's taxable income under the Income Tax Act 1976 or the [Tax Administration Act 1994][480] has been given under the relevant one of those Acts; and
    
    *   (b) the notice was dated,---
    
    the assessment is to be taken, for the purposes of this section, to have been made on the date of the notice.
    
    (7) Nothing in this section is to be taken to prevent the Commissioner making a determination under [Part 5A][123], [6A][173], or [6B][190] or the court making an order under [Part 7][208].

    (2) If, at the time of making the assessment, the Commissioner is unable to determine the amount of the liable parent's taxable income for the most recent tax year, then the Commissioner may make a formula assessment on the basis that the liable parent's child support income amount is the lesser of---
        
    *   (a) the sum of---
            
        *   (i) the taxable income derived by the liable parent in the first 10 months of the most recent tax year; and

    *   (a) the enactment of any Act amending the [Income Tax Act 2007][560] or the making of any regulation or Order in Council relating to income tax, during the period commencing on the first day of the last month in that child support year and ending with the due date for payments in respect of that month; or

    *   (c) the adoption by the person of an incorrect interpretation of any provision of this Act or of the Income Tax Act 1976 or the [Income Tax Act 2007][560], being an interpretation which, although incorrect, is reasonable having regard to the circumstances of the case,---
    
    the Commissioner shall, to the extent that the penalty is higher than it would otherwise have been, write off the penalty or any part thereof.

    that person---
        
    *   (c) shall pay by the due date the amount that would have been payable if the increase had not taken effect; and

*   (1) Where an application is made to a Family Court under [section 104][225] for an order in relation to a child and the court is satisfied that---
        
    *   (a) 1 or more of the grounds for departure mentioned in subsection (2) exists or exist; and
    
    *   (b) it would be---
            
        *   (i) just and equitable as regards the child, the qualifying custodian, and the liable parent; and
        
        *   (ii) otherwise proper,---
        
        to make a particular order of the type specified in [section 106][227],---
    
    the court may make the order.
    
    (2) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the grounds for departure are as follows:
        
    *   (a) that, by virtue of special circumstances, the capacity of either parent to provide financial support for the child is significantly reduced because of---
            
        *   (i) the duty of the parent to maintain any other child or another person; or
        
        *   (ii) special needs of any other child or another person that the parent has a duty to maintain; or
        
        *   (iii) commitments of the parent necessary to enable the parent to support---
                
            *   (A) himself or herself; or

    *   (b) that, in the special circumstances of the case, the costs of maintaining the child are significantly affected because---
            
        *   (i) of high costs incurred by a liable parent or a qualifying custodian in enabling that liable parent access to the child; or
        
        *   (ii) of special needs of the child; or
        
        *   (iii) the child is being cared for, educated, or trained in the manner that was expected by either of his or her parents; or
        
        
    
    *   (c) that, by virtue of special circumstances, application in relation to the child of the provisions of this Act relating to formula assessment of child support would result in an unjust and inequitable determination of the level of financial support to be provided by the liable parent for the child because of---
            
        *   (i) the income, earning capacity, property, and financial resources of either parent or the child; or
        
        *   (ii) any payments, and any transfer or settlement of property, previously made (whether under this Act, the [Property (Relationships) Act 1976][622] or otherwise) by the liable parent to the child, to the qualifying custodian, or to any other person for the benefit of the child; or

    (3) For the purposes of subsection (2)(b)(i), costs incurred in enabling a liable parent access to the child are not to be taken to be high unless the total of those costs during a child support year is more than 5% of the child support income amount for the year in relation to the person concerned.
    
    (4) In determining whether it would be just and equitable as regards the child, the qualifying custodian, and the liable parent to make a particular order of the type specified in [section 106][227], the court shall have regard to---
        
    *   (a) the objects of this Act, and, in particular, the nature of the duty of a parent to maintain a child and the fact that it is the parents of a child themselves who have the primary duty to maintain the child; and
    
    *   (b) the proper needs of the child, having regard to---
            
        *   (i) the manner in which the child is being, and in which the parents expect the child to be, cared for, educated, or trained; and
        
        *   (ii) any special needs of the child; and
        
        
    
    *   (c) the income, earning capacity, property, and financial resources of the child; and
    
    *   (d) the income, earning capacity, property, and financial resources of each parent who is a party to the proceeding; and
    
    *   (e) the commitments of each parent who is a party to the proceeding that are necessary to enable the parent to support---
            
        *   (i) himself or herself; or
        
        *   (ii) any other child or another person that the parent has a duty to maintain; and
        
        
    
    *   (f) the direct and indirect costs incurred by the qualifying custodian in providing care for the child, including the income and earning capacity foregone by the qualifying custodian in providing that care; and
    
    *   (g) any hardship that would be caused to---
            
        *   (i) the child or the qualifying custodian by the making of, or the refusal to make, the order; or
        
        *   (ii) the liable parent, or any other child or another person that the liable parent has a duty to support, by the making of, or the refusal to make, the order.
        
        
    
    (5) In having regard to the income, earning capacity, property, and financial resources of the child or a parent of the child, the court must---
        
    *   (a) have regard to the capacity of the child or parent to earn or derive income, including having regard to any assets of, under the control of, or held for the benefit of, the child or parent that do not produce, but are capable of producing, income; and
    
    *   (b) disregard the income, earning capacity, property, and financial resources of any person who does not have a duty to maintain the child, or who has such a duty but is not a party to the proceeding, unless, in the special circumstances of the case, the court considers that it is appropriate to have regard to them.
    
    (6) The court may have regard to other matters beyond those specified in subsections (4) and (5).

    (8) The court must not, in considering the variation of an order, have regard to a change in the all groups index number of the New Zealand Consumer Price Index unless at least 12 months have elapsed since the order was made, or was last varied having regard to such a change.
    
    (9) In satisfying itself for the purposes of subsection (4)(c), the court must have regard to any payments, and any transfer or settlement of property, previously made by the liable parent to the child, to the qualifying custodian, or to any other person for the benefit of the child.
    
    (10) The discharge of an order does not affect the recovery of arrears due under the order, or under this Act, when the discharge takes effect.

    (11) Every such vesting order shall have the same effect as if all persons entitled to the property had been free from all disability and had duly executed all proper conveyances, transfers, and assignments of the property for such estate or interest as is specified in the order; and in the case of land which is subject to the [Land Transfer Act 1952][685] the purchaser's title thereto shall be registered accordingly.
