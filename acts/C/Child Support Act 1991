*   (1) Subject to this Part, where an assessment has been made of a person's taxable income under the Income Tax Act 1976 (other than an assessment made under section 21 of that Act or the [Tax Administration Act 1994][471] (other than an assessment made under [section 106][538] of that Act)) for any income year, then, in making a formula assessment, the person's taxable income under the relevant one of those Acts for that income year is, for the purposes of this Act, to be taken to be that taxable income as so assessed or as last so assessed, as the case may be, before the making of the formula assessment.
    
    (2) Subsection (1) has effect despite the making, after the making of the formula assessment, of an amendment under the Income Tax Act 1976 or the [Tax Administration Act 1994][471] to the relevant assessment of the person's taxable income under the relevant one of those Acts (whether or not the amendment is made because of an objection in relation to the assessment).
    
    (3) Subsection (2) does not apply in relation to the person in any case where---
        
    *   (a) the taxable income of that person assessed under the Income Tax Act 1976 or the [Tax Administration Act 1994][471] in any amended assessment made after the making of a formula assessment for a child support year is more than $500 in excess of, or less than, the taxable income of that person assessed, or last assessed, before the making of the formula assessment; and
    
    *   (b) notice of the amended assessment is issued by the Commissioner on or before the last day in the child support year;---
    
    and, where such an amendment is made, the person's taxable income under the relevant Act for that income year is to be taken to be, and always to have been, the person's taxable income for the income year as last so assessed under the relevant Act, and the Commissioner shall amend the formula assessment accordingly.
    
    (4) Subsection (2) does not apply in relation to the person in any case where the reason (or one of the reasons) that the amendment was made was because, in the opinion of the Commissioner, the return of income made by the person under the Income Tax Act 1976 or the [Tax Administration Act 1994][471] was fraudulent or wilfully misleading or omitted all mention of income which is of a particular nature or was derived from a particular source, and, where such an amendment is made, the person's taxable income under the relevant Act for that income year is to be taken to be, and always to have been, the person's taxable income for the income year as last so assessed under the relevant Act.
    
    (5) Where---
        
    *   (a) the Commissioner, applying subsection (1), assesses the annual rate of child support payable by a liable parent; and

    *   (c) neither subsection (3) nor subsection (4) applies in relation to the amendment,---
    
    then, in subsequently amending the formula assessment other than for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions of [section 39(3)][54] of this Act, the amendment made under the Income Tax Act 1976 or the [Tax Administration Act 1994][471] is to be disregarded.
    
    (6) Where---
        
    *   (a) notice of an assessment (including an amended assessment) of a person's taxable income under the Income Tax Act 1976 or the [Tax Administration Act 1994][471] has been given under the relevant one of those Acts; and
    
    *   (b) the notice was dated,---
    
    the assessment is to be taken, for the purposes of this section, to have been made on the date of the notice.

##### 38A Position where taxable income from withholding income not available for full tax year
    
*   (1) This section applies where the Commissioner assesses the annual rate of child support payable under a formula assessment by a liable parent whose taxable income for the first 10 months of the most recent tax year was derived solely from withholding income.
    
    (2) If, at the time of making the assessment, the Commissioner is unable to determine the amount of the liable parent's taxable income for the most recent tax year, then the Commissioner may make a formula assessment on the basis that the liable parent's child support income amount is the lesser of---
        
    *   (a) the sum of---
            
        *   (i) the taxable income derived by the liable parent in the first 10 months of the most recent tax year; and
        
        *   (ii) an amount that is equal to one-fifth of that taxable income; or
        
        
    
    *   (b) an amount equal to 2.5 times the yearly equivalent of the relevant average weekly earnings amount for the most recent tax year.
    
    (3) The Commissioner must, as soon as practicable, amend a formula assessment if---
        
    *   (a) the Commissioner applies subsection (2) in making the formula assessment; and
    
    *   (b) the Commissioner subsequently ascertains the liable parent's taxable income for the most recent tax year (whether or not an assessment has been made under the Income Tax Act 1976 or the [Tax Administration Act 1994][471] in respect of that year); and
    
    *   (c) the subsequently ascertained income is more than $500 in excess of, or less than, the figure calculated for the purposes of subsection (2)(a).
    
    (4) An assessment amended under subsection (3) must be amended on the basis that the liable parent's taxable income for the most recent tax year is, and always has been, the subsequently ascertained income.

    *   (a) the enactment of any Act amending the [Income Tax Act 2007][546] or the making of any regulation or Order in Council relating to income tax, during the period commencing on the first day of the last month in that child support year and ending with the due date for payments in respect of that month; or

    *   (c) the adoption by the person of an incorrect interpretation of any provision of this Act or of the Income Tax Act 1976 or the [Income Tax Act 2007][546], being an interpretation which, although incorrect, is reasonable having regard to the circumstances of the case,---

    that person---
        
    *   (c) shall pay by the due date the amount that would have been payable if the increase had not taken effect; and

##### 105 Matters as to which court must be satisfied before making order
    
*   (1) Where an application is made to a Family Court under [section 104][224] for an order in relation to a child and the court is satisfied that---
        
    *   (a) 1 or more of the grounds for departure mentioned in subsection (2) exists or exist; and
    
    *   (b) it would be---
            
        *   (i) just and equitable as regards the child, the qualifying custodian, and the liable parent; and
        
        *   (ii) otherwise proper,---
        
        to make a particular order of the type specified in [section 106][226],---
    
    the court may make the order.
    
    (2) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the grounds for departure are as follows:
        
    *   (a) that, by virtue of special circumstances, the capacity of either parent to provide financial support for the child is significantly reduced because of---
            
        *   (i) the duty of the parent to maintain any other child or another person; or
        
        *   (ii) special needs of any other child or another person that the parent has a duty to maintain; or
        
        *   (iii) commitments of the parent necessary to enable the parent to support---
                
            *   (A) himself or herself; or
            
            *   (B) any other child or another person whom the parent has a duty to maintain; or
            
            
        
        
    
    *   (b) that, in the special circumstances of the case, the costs of maintaining the child are significantly affected because---
            
        *   (i) of high costs incurred by a liable parent or a qualifying custodian in enabling that liable parent access to the child; or
        
        *   (ii) of special needs of the child; or
        
        *   (iii) the child is being cared for, educated, or trained in the manner that was expected by either of his or her parents; or
        
        
    
    *   (c) that, by virtue of special circumstances, application in relation to the child of the provisions of this Act relating to formula assessment of child support would result in an unjust and inequitable determination of the level of financial support to be provided by the liable parent for the child because of---
            
        *   (i) the income, earning capacity, property, and financial resources of either parent or the child; or
        
        *   (ii) any payments, and any transfer or settlement of property, previously made (whether under this Act, the [Property (Relationships) Act 1976][603] or otherwise) by the liable parent to the child, to the qualifying custodian, or to any other person for the benefit of the child; or
        
        *   (iii) an entitlement of the custodian to the continued occupancy of a property in which the liable parent has a financial interest.
        
        
    
    (3) For the purposes of subsection (2)(b)(i), costs incurred in enabling a liable parent access to the child are not to be taken to be high unless the total of those costs during a child support year is more than 5% of the child support income amount for the year in relation to the person concerned.
    
    (4) In determining whether it would be just and equitable as regards the child, the qualifying custodian, and the liable parent to make a particular order of the type specified in [section 106][226], the court shall have regard to---
        
    *   (a) the objects of this Act, and, in particular, the nature of the duty of a parent to maintain a child and the fact that it is the parents of a child themselves who have the primary duty to maintain the child; and
    
    *   (b) the proper needs of the child, having regard to---
            
        *   (i) the manner in which the child is being, and in which the parents expect the child to be, cared for, educated, or trained; and
        
        *   (ii) any special needs of the child; and
        
        
    
    *   (c) the income, earning capacity, property, and financial resources of the child; and
    
    *   (d) the income, earning capacity, property, and financial resources of each parent who is a party to the proceeding; and
    
    *   (e) the commitments of each parent who is a party to the proceeding that are necessary to enable the parent to support---
            
        *   (i) himself or herself; or
        
        *   (ii) any other child or another person that the parent has a duty to maintain; and
        
        
    
    *   (f) the direct and indirect costs incurred by the qualifying custodian in providing care for the child, including the income and earning capacity foregone by the qualifying custodian in providing that care; and
    
    *   (g) any hardship that would be caused to---
            
        *   (i) the child or the qualifying custodian by the making of, or the refusal to make, the order; or
        
        *   (ii) the liable parent, or any other child or another person that the liable parent has a duty to support, by the making of, or the refusal to make, the order.
        
        
    
    (5) In having regard to the income, earning capacity, property, and financial resources of the child or a parent of the child, the court must---
        
    *   (a) have regard to the capacity of the child or parent to earn or derive income, including having regard to any assets of, under the control of, or held for the benefit of, the child or parent that do not produce, but are capable of producing, income; and
    
    *   (b) disregard the income, earning capacity, property, and financial resources of any person who does not have a duty to maintain the child, or who has such a duty but is not a party to the proceeding, unless, in the special circumstances of the case, the court considers that it is appropriate to have regard to them.
    
    (6) The court may have regard to other matters beyond those specified in subsections (4) and (5).

    (2) If an order under [section 103D][221] or [section 106][226] or [section 109][230] is in force in relation to a child (whether or not all things ordered to be done by the order have been done), a Family Court may, on receipt of an application made under subsection (1) or where it is satisfied that it ought to do so, by order---

        *   (i) in a way that is inconsistent with the provisions of the section under which the order was made; or
        
        *   (ii) so as to reduce the liability of any person to pay child support in a child support year below the equivalent of an annual rate that is equal to the minimum annual rate for that year under [section 72(1)(a)][102].
        
        
    
    (3) The court shall not discharge, suspend, revive, or vary an order under subsection (1) unless the court is satisfied, having regard in particular to any statement included in the order under [section 110][231], that it would be---

    *   (b) otherwise proper,---

    (4) The court shall not, by any order under this section, vary an order unless it is also satisfied---
        
    *   (a) that making the variation is justified because of a change in the circumstances of the child, the qualifying custodian, or a liable parent concerned since the order was made or last varied; or
    
    *   (b) that making the variation is justified because of a change in the all groups index number of the New Zealand Consumer Price Index since the order was made or last varied; or

    (8) The court must not, in considering the variation of an order, have regard to a change in the all groups index number of the New Zealand Consumer Price Index unless at least 12 months have elapsed since the order was made, or was last varied having regard to such a change.
    
    (9) In satisfying itself for the purposes of subsection (4)(c), the court must have regard to any payments, and any transfer or settlement of property, previously made by the liable parent to the child, to the qualifying custodian, or to any other person for the benefit of the child.
    
    (10) The discharge of an order does not affect the recovery of arrears due under the order, or under this Act, when the discharge takes effect.

    *   (b) that is valid and effectual under the [Personal Property Securities Act 1999][661] without registration thereof,---
    
    but, subject to this section, shall have priority over all other mortgages, charges, or encumbrances.

    (4) Despite [section 23(b)][662] of the Personal Property Securities Act 1999, if a charge affects property against which charges may be registered under a registration Act, the Commissioner may register the charge under the registration Act.

    (7B) The Commissioner is not required to pay a fee for the release of a charge that is registered under a registration Act in reliance on this section.
    
    (8) Any charge created by this section which is registered against any property shall operate to secure any amount secured by any prior unregistered charge and unpaid at the time of registration of the charge, and also to secure any amount secured by any charge coming into existence after the registration of the charge, so that the registered charge shall operate to secure the total of all amounts for the time being owing by the payer under all charges created by this section.
    
    (9) If any amount constitutes by virtue of this section a charge on any property, a Family Court or a District Court may make such order as it thinks fit, either for the sale of that property or of any part thereof, or for the appointment of a receiver of the rents, profits, or income thereof, and for the payment of the amount of the charge and the costs of the Commissioner out of the proceeds of the sale or out of the rents, profits, or income.
    
    (10) Where any property has been sold under any such order, the Family Court or, as the case may be, the District Court may, on the application of the purchaser or the Commissioner, make an order vesting the property in the purchaser.
    
    (11) Every such vesting order shall have the same effect as if all persons entitled to the property had been free from all disability and had duly executed all proper conveyances, transfers, and assignments of the property for such estate or interest as is specified in the order; and in the case of land which is subject to the [Land Transfer Act 1952][664] the purchaser's title thereto shall be registered accordingly.

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Child Support Act 1991\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 20 August 2012, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][779] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][780] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][781] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][782] and [17E][783] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
