##### 38I Information about other travel may be searched for information relating to travellers within 28-day period
    
*   (1) In this section, _information about other travel_ means information---
        
    *   (a) to which access is given under [section 38E][71]; and
    
    *   (b) that is not information about travel within the 28-day period.
    
    (2) This section applies to the following situation:
        
    *   (a) the Customs, in considering information viewed under [section 38H][76], finds information about travel within the 28-day period that relates to an arrival or departure, and to travel, by a person:
    
    *   (b) the Customs wishes---
            
        *   (i) to search information about other travel to determine whether it includes information that relates to that person; and
        
        *   (ii) to view any information that relates to that person and is found as a result of the search.
        
        
    
    (3) In that situation, the Customs may without warrant---
        
    *   (a) search information about other travel to determine whether it includes information that relates to the person; and
    
    *   (b) view information in accordance with subsection (5).
    
    (4) However, the search may be conducted only if it can be completed within 14 days after the arrival or departure to which the information about travel within the 28-day period relates (_see_ [section 38H(5)(a)][76]).
    
    (5) The Customs must not view information about other travel unless that information relates to the person and is found as a result of the search.
    
    (6) Powers under this section of viewing or searching are exercisable in a particular case even though, in the circumstances of that case, the purpose of the viewing or searching would not be, or would not be likely to be, frustrated if the viewing or searching were delayed until a warrant under [section 38J][78] could be obtained to authorise it.

##### 38J Search and viewing warrants
    
*   (1) This section applies to the following situation:
        
    *   (a) the chief executive considers, in the light of information of any kind that is available to the Customs, that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that---
            
        *   (i) there exists a risk or threat relevant to the purpose stated in [section 38B(1)][66]; or
        
        *   (ii) a relevant offence (as defined in subsection (6)) has been, is being, or will be committed:
        
        
    
    *   (b) the Customs wishes---
            
        *   (i) to search information to which access is given under [section 38E][71] to determine whether it includes information that is relevant to search criteria specified by the Customs (being search criteria that are reasonably related to the information available to the Customs that gives rise to the reasonable grounds to suspect required by paragraph (a)); and
        
        *   (ii) to view any information that is relevant to the search criteria specified by the Customs and is found as a result of the search:
        
        
    
    *   (c) the search cannot be conducted and the viewing done under [section 38H][76] or [section 38I][77], or the Customs considers it would be inexpedient for those things to be done under section 38H or section 38I.
    
    (2) In that situation, the chief executive may, by application in writing made on oath, apply to a District Court Judge for a search and viewing warrant authorising---
        
    *   (a) the carrying out of the search within 14 days after the day on which the warrant is granted (or within any extension of that period granted by a District Court Judge on an application in writing for the purpose made within that period); and
    
    *   (b) the viewing by the Customs of any information that is relevant to the search criteria specified by the Customs and that is included in information to which access is given under [section 38E][71], but of no other information.
    
    (3) The application must give details of the reasonable grounds to suspect required by subsection (1), of the information available to the Customs that gives rise to those reasonable grounds to suspect, and of the search criteria specified by the Customs, and it must also indicate whether the search is to be of all, or of only a specified part or parts, of the information to which access is given under [section 38E][71].
    
    (4) On an application under subsection (2), a District Court Judge may grant a search and viewing warrant in the prescribed form, but only if he or she is satisfied that---
        
    *   (a) the reasonable grounds to suspect required by subsection (1) exist; and
    
    *   (b) the search criteria specified by the Customs are reasonably related to the information available to the Customs that gives rise to those reasonable grounds to suspect.
    
    (5) The warrant is sufficient authority for the doing of the things specified in subsection (2)(a) and (b).
    
    (6) In this section and [section 38K][79], _relevant offence_ means an offence described in [section 38B(1)(b)][66], or relevant to the purpose stated in [section 38B(1)][66] (except paragraph (b)).

##### 38K Search and viewing without warrant in emergencies
    
*   (1) This section applies to the following situation:
        
    *   (a) the situation specified in [section 38J(1)][78] applies:
    
    *   (b) the chief executive considers that, if he or she were to apply to a District Court Judge for a search and viewing warrant under [section 38J][78], the District Court Judge would grant the warrant:
    
    *   (c) the chief executive also considers that delaying a search and any resulting viewing until a search and viewing warrant can be obtained under section 38J would create a real risk that---
            
        *   (i) the countering of the risk or threat referred to in section 38J(1)(a)(i) would be frustrated; or (as the case requires)
        
        *   (ii) the prevention, detection, investigation, prosecution, or punishment of the relevant offence would be frustrated.
        
        
    
    (2) In that situation, the chief executive may, with no further authority than this section, have the things specified in [section 38J(2)(a) and (b)][78] done as if the doing of those things were authorised by a search and viewing warrant under section 38J(4).
    
    (3) However, if the chief executive acts under subsection (2), he or she must within 72 hours apply under [section 38J(2)][78] for a search and viewing warrant in relation to the matter.

*   (1) This subsection applies to both of the following situations:

    *   (b) the application required by [section 38K(3)][79] is made but, in response to it, either no warrant is granted under [section 38J(4)][78], or a warrant is granted under section 38J(4) authorising the doing of some only of the things done in reliance on section 38K(2).
    
    (2) In a situation to which subsection (1) applies, things done in reliance on [section 38K(2)][79] must, to the extent that the doing of those things is not authorised by a warrant granted under [section 38J(4)][78], be treated for the purposes only of the countering of the risk or threat referred to in section 38J(1)(a)(i) or (as the case requires) of the prevention, detection, investigation, prosecution, or punishment of the relevant offence, as if they were done without the authority of section 38K or of a warrant granted under section 38J(4).
    
    (3) In a situation to which subsection (1) applies,---
        
    *   (a) the Customs must destroy immediately information viewed by it in reliance on [section 38K(2)][79] and that is collected by it for a purpose specified in [section 282A][457] if the viewing of that information is not authorised by a warrant granted under [section 38J(4)][78]; and
    
    *   (b) other persons or bodies must destroy immediately information viewed by the Customs in reliance on [section 38K(2)][79] and disclosed by it to the other persons or bodies for a purpose specified in [section 282A(2)][457] and collected by the other persons or bodies if the viewing of that information is not authorised by a warrant granted under [section 38J(4)][78].

    (2) Despite any enactment or rule of law or rules of court entitling a party to proceedings to demand the production of documents, no party of that kind is entitled to demand the production of documents held in safe custody under subsection (1), except in accordance with this section.
    
    (3) Every party of that kind who requires the production of a document held in safe custody under subsection (1) must, except in a case to which subsection (9) or subsection (10) applies, apply in writing to the Registrar, who must promptly notify the chief executive.
    
    (4) If, within 3 days after notice is given to the chief executive under subsection (3), the chief executive gives written notice to the Registrar that he or she intends to oppose the production of the documents, the Registrar must refer the matter to a District Court Judge.
    
    (5) If the chief executive does not give the written notice referred to in subsection (4), the Registrar must produce the documents to the party applying for production.
    
    (6) If a matter is referred to a Judge under subsection (4), both the person requesting production of the documents and the chief executive opposing production must be given an opportunity to be heard.
    
    (7) The Judge may order that all or a specified part of a document the production of which is in dispute not be produced if he or she is satisfied that---
        
    *   (a) the document or part contains information of a kind referred to in [section 38N(1)][82]; and
    
    *   (b) production of that information would involve disclosure of a kind referred to in [section 38N(2)][82].
    
    (8) Subject to subsection (7), the Judge must order the production of the documents to the party requesting it.
    
    (9) If a request for the production of a document kept in safe custody under subsection (1) is made in the course of proceedings presided over by a District Court Judge and the request is opposed, the Judge must adjudicate upon the matter as if it had been referred to him or her under subsection (4).
    
    (10) If a request of that kind is made in the course of any other proceedings, the presiding judicial officer must promptly refer the matter to a District Court Judge for adjudication of the kind referred to in subsection (9).
    
    (11) Despite anything in this section, every District Court Judge or Judge of the High Court who is presiding over any proceedings in which the issue of a warrant under [section 38J][78] is in issue is entitled to inspect any relevant document held under subsection (1).

    (2) Disclosure of information falls within [section 38M(7)(b)][81] if the disclosure would be likely---

    *   (a) the goods have ceased to be subject to the control of the Customs; or
    
    *   (b) a bond or other security has been given for the payment of duty; or
    
    *   (c) no proper assessment of duty has been made under this Act or that a deficient assessment of duty has been made.
    
    (6) The chief executive may, subject to such terms and conditions as he or she may impose, approve any person or class of persons as persons who may defer the payment of duty due under this section and, for that purpose, may determine a duty accounting period; and may suspend or withdraw that approval or vary any term or condition under which the approval is given or vary the duty accounting period.

    *   (a) additional duty of 5% of the amount of duty unpaid by the due date; and

*   (1) Subject to [section 94][187], the chief executive may from time to time make such amendments to an assessment of duty as he or she thinks necessary in order to ensure the correctness of the assessment even though the goods to which the duty relates are no longer subject to the control of the Customs or that the duty originally assessed has been paid.
    
    (2) If the amendment has the effect of imposing a fresh liability or altering an existing liability, notice in writing shall be given by the chief executive to the person liable for the duty.

    *   (a) in the opinion of the chief executive, the Customs value cannot be determined under this clause; or
    
    *   (b) the chief executive has reason to doubt the truth or accuracy of the declared Customs value and, after having sought further explanation or other evidence that the declared Customs value represents the total amount actually paid or payable for the imported goods, the chief executive is still not satisfied that the Customs value can be determined under this clause---
    
    the chief executive may determine the Customs value of the goods by proceeding sequentially through [clauses 4 to 8][943] to the first such clause of this schedule under which the Customs value can, in the opinion of the chief executive, be determined.

    *   (a) to a buyer at the same or substantially the same trade level as the buyer of the goods being valued; and
    
    *   (b) in the same or substantially the same quantities as the goods being valued.

    *   (a) to a buyer at the same or substantially the same trade level as the buyer of the goods being valued but in quantities different from the quantities in which those goods were sold; or

    *   (c) to a buyer at a trade level different from that of the buyer of the goods being valued and in quantities different from the quantities in which those goods were sold.
    
    (3) For the purposes of determining the Customs value of imported goods under subclause (1), the transaction value of identical goods shall be adjusted by adding thereto or deducting therefrom, as the case may be, amounts to account for---
        
    *   (a) commercially significant differences between the costs, charges, and expenses referred to in [clause 3(1)(a)(vii)][942] in respect of the identical goods and those costs, charges, and expenses in respect of the goods being valued that are attributable to differences in distances and modes of transport:
    
    *   (b) where the transaction value is in respect of identical goods sold under the conditions described in any of paragraphs (a) to (c) of subclause (2), differences in the trade levels of the buyers of the identical goods and the goods being valued or the quantities in which the identical goods and the goods being valued were sold or both, as the case may be,---
    
    if each amount can, in the opinion of the chief executive, be determined on the basis of sufficient information.

    (4) Where, in relation to imported goods being valued, there are 2 or more transaction values of identical goods that meet all the requirements set out in subclauses (1) and (3) or where there is no such transaction value but there are 2 or more transaction values of identical goods sold under the conditions described in any of paragraphs (a) to (c) of subclause (2) that meet all the requirements set out in this clause that are applicable by virtue of subclause (2), the Customs value of the goods being valued shall be determined on the basis of the lowest such transaction value.

##### 5 Transaction value of similar goods as Customs value
    
*   (1) Subject to subclause (2) of this clause and subclauses (2) to (4) of [clause 4][943], where the Customs value of imported goods cannot, in the opinion of the chief executive, be determined under clause 4, the Customs value of the goods shall be the transaction value of similar goods in respect of a sale of those goods for export to New Zealand if that transaction value is the Customs value of the similar goods and the similar goods were exported at the same or substantially the same time as the goods being valued and were sold under the following conditions:
        
    *   (a) to a buyer at the same or substantially the same trade level as the buyer of the goods being valued; and
    
    *   (b) in the same or substantially the same quantities as the goods being valued.

##### 6 Deductive value as Customs value
    
*   (1) Subject to subclauses (5) and (6) of [clause 2][941], where the Customs value cannot, in the opinion of the chief executive, be determined under [clause 5][944], the Customs value of the goods shall be the deductive value in respect of the goods.
    
    (2) Where the goods being valued or identical goods or similar goods are sold in New Zealand in the condition in which they were imported at the same or substantially the same time as the time of importation of the goods being valued, the deductive value of the goods being valued shall be the price per unit in respect of sales described in subclause (5), determined in accordance with that subclause and adjusted in accordance with subclause (6), at which the greatest number of units of the goods being valued or identical goods or similar goods are so sold.
    
    (3) Where the goods being valued or identical goods or similar goods are sold in New Zealand in the condition in which they were imported before the expiration of 90 days after the importation of the goods being valued but are not so sold at the same or substantially the same time as the time of that importation, the deductive value of the goods being valued shall be the price per unit in respect of sales described in subclause (5), determined in accordance with that subclause and adjusted in accordance with subclause (6), at which the greatest number of units of the goods being valued or identical goods or similar goods are so sold at the earliest date after the importation of the goods being valued.
    
    (4) Where the goods being valued or identical goods or similar goods are not sold in New Zealand in the circumstances described in subclause (2) or subclause (3), but the goods being valued, after being assembled, packaged, or further processed in New Zealand, are sold in New Zealand before the expiration of 90 days after the importation thereof and the importer of the goods being valued requests that this subclause be applied in the determination of the Customs value of those goods, the deductive value of the goods being valued shall be the price per unit, in respect of sales described in subclause (5), determined in accordance with that subclause and adjusted in accordance with subclause (6), at which the greatest number of units of the goods being valued are so sold.
    
    (5) For the purposes of subclauses (2) to (4), the price per unit in respect of any goods being valued or identical goods or similar goods, shall be determined by ascertaining the unit price in respect of sales of the goods at the first trade level after their importation to persons who---
        
    *   (a) are not related to the persons from whom they buy the goods at the time the goods are sold to them; and
    
    *   (b) have not supplied, directly or indirectly, free of charge or at a reduced cost for use in connection with the production and sale for export of the goods, any of the goods or services referred to in [clause 3(1)(a)(iii)][942],---
    
    at which the greatest number of units of the goods is sold where, in the opinion of the chief executive, a sufficient number of such sales have been made to permit a determination of the price per unit of the goods.
    
    (6) For the purposes of subclauses (2) to (4), the price per unit in respect of any goods being valued or identical goods or similar goods, shall be adjusted by deducting therefrom an amount equal to the aggregate of---
        
    *   (a) an amount, determined in accordance with subclause (7), equal to---
            
        *   (i) the amount of commission generally earned on a unit basis; or
        
        *   (ii) the amount for profit and general expenses, including all costs of marketing the goods, considered together as a whole, that is generally reflected on a unit basis---
        
        in connection with sales in New Zealand of goods of the same class or kind as those goods:
    
    *   (b) reasonable costs, charges, and expenses that are incurred in respect of the transportation and insurance of the goods within New Zealand and reasonable costs, charges, and expenses associated therewith to the extent that an amount for such costs, charges, and expenses is not deducted in respect of general expenses under paragraph (a):
    
    *   (c) the costs, charges, and expenses referred to in [clause 3(1)(b)(i)][942] incurred in respect of the goods, to the extent that an amount for such costs, charges, and expenses is not deducted in respect of general expenses under paragraph (a) of this subclause:
    
    *   (d) any Customs duties or other taxes payable in New Zealand by reason of the importation or sale of the goods, to the extent that an amount for such duties and taxes is not deducted in respect of general expenses under paragraph (a):
    
    *   (e) where subclause (4) applies, the amount of the value added to the goods that is attributable to the assembly, packaging, or further processing in New Zealand of the goods, if that amount is determined, in the opinion of the chief executive, on the basis of sufficient information.
    
    (7) The amount considered to be equal to the amount of commission or the amount for profit and general expenses referred to in subclause (6)(a) shall be calculated on a percentage basis and determined on the basis of information prepared in a manner consistent with generally accepted accounting principles that is supplied---
        
    *   (a) by or on behalf of the importer of the goods being valued; or
    
    *   (b) where the information supplied by or on behalf of the importer of the goods being valued is not sufficient information, but an examination of sales in New Zealand of the narrowest group or range of goods of the same class or kind as the goods being valued from which sufficient information can, in the opinion of the chief executive, be obtained.
    
    (8) Where an amount referred to in subclause (6)(e) in respect of any goods being valued cannot, in the opinion of the chief executive, be determined on the basis of sufficient information, the Customs value of the goods cannot be determined on the basis of the deductive value under subclause (4).

##### 7 Computed value as Customs value
    
*   (1) Subject to subclauses (3) and (5) of [clause 2][941], where the Customs value of imported goods cannot, in the opinion of the chief executive be determined under [clause 6][940], the Customs value of the goods shall be the computed value in respect of those goods.

*   Where the value of the goods cannot be determined under [clause 1][946] for the reason that the goods were not sold under the conditions specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of that clause, the value shall be the fair market value of those goods as determined under [clause 4][945].

##### 4 Fair market value
    
*   (1) For the purposes of this section,---
        
    *   (a) the expression _identical goods_ means goods that are the same in all respects, including physical characteristics, quality, and reputation, as the goods being valued, except for minor differences (if any) in appearance that do not affect the value of the goods:

        *   (i) that the price is the sole consideration; and
        
        *   (ii) that the price is not influenced by any commercial, financial, or other ties, whether by contract or otherwise, between the seller, or any person associated in business with the seller, and the buyer, or any person associated in business with the buyer (other than the relationship created by the sale of the goods in question); and
        
        *   (iii) that no part of the proceeds of any subsequent resale, use, or disposal of the goods will accrue, either directly or indirectly, to the seller, or to any person associated in business with the seller:

    *   (e) in determining a fair market value in accordance with this section, the chief executive shall---
            
        *   (i) use only those prices which represent a sale between buyers and sellers independent of each other; and
        
        *   (ii) exclude from the price any excise duty and goods and services tax.

    (3) The fair market value of any goods at the date of removal shall be the lowest price for which identical goods in the same or substantially the same quantities are generally sold at that date in the open market in New Zealand on sales freely offered and made on ordinary trade terms by the licensee of an area licensed under [section 12][17], other than a contractor.
    
    (4) Where, in the opinion of the chief executive, the fair market value cannot be determined under subclause (3), it shall be deemed to be the lowest price for which identical goods in quantities different from those being sold are generally sold at that date in the open market in New Zealand on sales freely offered and made on ordinary trade terms by the licensee of an area licensed under [section 12][17], other than a contractor.
    
    (5) Where, in the opinion of the chief executive, the fair market value cannot be determined under subclause (4), it shall be deemed to be the lowest price for which similar goods in the same or substantially the same quantities are generally sold at that date in the open market in New Zealand on sales freely offered and made on ordinary trade terms by the licensee of an area licensed under [section 12][17], other than a contractor.
    
    (6) Where, in the opinion of the chief executive, the fair market value cannot be determined under subclause (5), it shall be deemed to be the lowest price for which similar goods in quantities different from those being sold are generally sold at that date in the open market in New Zealand on sales freely offered and made on ordinary trade terms by the licensee of an area licensed under [section 12][17], other than a contractor.

    (8) Where, in the opinion of the chief executive, the fair market value cannot be determined under subclause (7), the chief executive shall compute the value of the goods by taking the costs of the production of the goods and adding such amount as reasonably represents the profit margin and other costs to the manufacturing level of those goods.

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Customs and Excise Act 1996\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 30 March 2013, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][995] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][996] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][997] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][998] and [17E][999] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
