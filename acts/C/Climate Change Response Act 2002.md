    *   (a) a person carrying out an activity listed in [subpart 1][435] of Part 5 of Schedule 3 and a person carrying out an activity listed in [subpart 2][426] of Part 5 of Schedule 3 to---
            
        *   (i) collect data or other information relating to the same synthetic fertiliser; and
        
        *   (ii) calculate emissions in respect of emissions relating to the same synthetic fertiliser; or
        
        
    
    *   (b) a person carrying out an activity listed in [subpart 3][436] of Part 5 of Schedule 3 and a person carrying out an activity listed in [subpart 4][427] of Part 5 of Schedule 3 to---

    (2) If the EPA decides under subsection (1) that an applicant is entitled to receive an allocation in respect of the application, then the EPA must---
        
    *   (a) notify the applicant of---
            
        *   (i) the number of units the applicant has been allocated in respect of the application and, in the case of an eligible industrial activity, any adjustment to that allocation that the EPA has made under subsection (1); and

    *   (a) the EPA's decision; and
    
    *   (b) the reasons for the decision; and

##### 86C Reconsideration of allocation decisions 
    
*   (1) Without limiting [section 144][221], the EPA may reconsider, vary, or revoke any decision made under [section 86B][149] if in the EPA's opinion the decision has resulted, or would otherwise result, in a person receiving an incorrect allocation because---
        
    *   (a) of an error in the calculation of the person's entitlement to an allocation or liability to repay units under this subpart; or
    
    *   (b) the person has provided altered, false, incomplete, or misleading information in or with an application.
    
    (2) The EPA may not make a decision in relation to an annual allocation adjustment or a closing allocation adjustment under [section 86B(4)][149] or vary or revoke a decision under subsection (1) after the expiration of 4 years from the end of the year or other period to which the decision relates if the decision, or variation or revocation of the decision, would decrease the number of units allocated to a person.
    
    (3) However, if the EPA is satisfied that a notice under [section 83(6)(b)][141] or [84(1)(c)(ii)][142] or application for an allocation, or any other document submitted under [section 86][147], [86E][152], or [144][221], was submitted with intent to deceive, the EPA may make a decision in relation to an annual allocation adjustment or a closing allocation adjustment under [section 86B(4)][149] or vary or revoke a decision under subsection (1) at any time so as to decrease the number of units allocated to the person to whom the notice or application related (including decreasing that number to zero).
    
    (4) If the EPA makes a decision in relation to an annual allocation adjustment or a closing allocation adjustment under [section 86B(4)][149] or varies or revokes a decision under subsection (1), the EPA must, as soon as practicable after doing so, notify the person who gave, or should have given, the notice under [section 83(6)(b)][141] or [84(1)(c)(ii)][142] or the applicant, as the case may be, of---
        
    *   (a) the particulars of the decision, or variation or revocation of the decision; and
    
    *   (b) any grounds or information upon which the decision or variation or revocation of the decision was based; and
    
    *   (c) the person's right under [section 144][221] to seek a review of the allocation decision.
    
    (5) If the result of a decision in relation to an annual allocation adjustment or a closing allocation adjustment under [section 86B(4)][149], variation or revocation of an allocation decision under subsection (1), or review under [section 144][221] is that a person allocated units is found to have been allocated and transferred---
        
    *   (a) units to which the person was not entitled, or to have repaid too few units, the person must within 60 working days of the date of the notice under subsection (4) repay the number of units notified to the person by transferring the units to a Crown holding account designated by the EPA; or
    
    *   (b) fewer units than the person was entitled to, or to have repaid too many units, the EPA must, as soon as practicable after the date of the notice under subsection (4), direct the Registrar to transfer to the holding account notified in the person's application (or any other holding account notified by the person) the number of New Zealand units recorded in the notice.
    
    (5A) Any additional allocation made under subsection (5)(b) must be excluded from the calculation of the number of New Zealand units that may be allocated for the purpose of a recommendation made under [section 30GA(1)(a)][70].
    
    (6) [Section 83(7)][141] applies to repayment of units under subsection (5) as if it were repayment under section 83\.

        *   (i) a new determination under [section 78][135] or a variation or revocation of a decision under [section 86C][151] to repay units allocated and transferred to the person; or
        
        *   (ii) an amendment under [section 120][193] or an assessment under [section 121][194] to surrender units (or additional units) or to repay units, in respect of any period covered by, or that should have been covered by, an emissions return; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) is convicted of an offence under [section 132(1)(c) to (f)][206] or [133][207] that relates to---
            
        *   (i) the units allocated and transferred to the person (including, but not limited to, the provision of information); or
        
        *   (ii) an emissions return that was---
                
            *   (A) amended under [section 120][193]; or
            
            *   (B) assessed under [section 121][194].
            
            
        
        
    
    (2) If this section applies, the person is liable, in addition to any penalty imposed in respect of the offence, to---
        
    *   (a) as the case may require,---
            
        *   (i) transfer to the Crown holding account designated by the Minister or EPA in the notice referred to in [section 79(3) ][136]or [86C(4)][150] a number of units equivalent to the number of units specified as being repayable in that notice under section 79(3)(a) or 86C(4), or in any review or appeal proceedings relating to that determination or decision; or
        
        *   (ii) surrender a number of units equivalent to the number of units determined by the EPA in the amendment under [section 120][193] or the assessment under [section 121][194], or in any review or appeal proceedings relating to that determination; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) pay an excess emissions penalty of $30 for each unit the person is liable to transfer or surrender under paragraph (a).
    
    (3) If this section applies, the EPA must give a notice to the person that---
        
    *   (a) sets out the---
            
        *   (i) number of additional units that the person is required to transfer to a Crown holding account or surrender under subsection (2); and
        
        *   (ii) amount of the excess emissions penalty to which the person is liable under subsection (2); and
        
        
    
    *   (b) requires the person to transfer to the designated Crown holding account or surrender the additional units, and pay the penalty within 60 working days of the date of the notice; and
    
    *   (c) advises that, unless both the units are transferred to the designated Crown holding account or surrendered (as the case may require) and the penalty paid in full by the due date, interest on the amount of the penalty will accrue in accordance with [section 137][212].
    
    (4) To avoid doubt, any liability to transfer units to a Crown holding account or surrender units and pay a penalty under subsection (2) is additional to, and does not affect, the liability of a person to surrender or repay units under any other section of this Act or to pay a penalty under a penalty notice given by the EPA under [section 134][208] or [134A][209].
    
    (5) The amount of the excess emissions penalty, together with any interest that accrues on that penalty, constitutes a debt due to the Crown and is recoverable by the EPA in a court of competent jurisdiction.

##### 137 Interest for late payment
    
*   (1) This section applies if---
        
    *   (a) a person---
            
        *   (i) has failed to surrender or repay units when required to do so and is liable to pay an excess emissions penalty in relation to those units under [section 134(2)(b)(i) or (iii)][208] or [134A(2)(b)][209]; or
        
        *   (ii) is required to surrender or repay units under [section 123][196] and is liable to pay an excess emissions penalty in relation to those units under [section 134(2)(b)(ii)][208] or [134A(2)(b)][209]; or
        
        *   (iii) is required to transfer units to a Crown holding account or surrender units and pay an excess emissions penalty under [section 136][211]; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) the person does not comply, or comply in full, with the requirement to surrender or repay units and to pay the penalty by the relevant date.
    
    (2) If this section applies, the person is liable to pay interest on the full amount of the excess emissions penalty---
        
    *   (a) at the rate prescribed by the Governor-General by Order in Council; and
    
    *   (b) for the period from the date by which the penalty was due to be paid until the associated liability to surrender or repay units or to transfer units to a Crown holding account under [section 136][211] (or to pay any associated debt under [section 159][240]) has been met, and until the penalty and any interest due have been paid in full.
    
    (3) To avoid doubt, interest accrues under subsection (2) even if the amount of the excess emissions penalty in a penalty notice has been paid in full if the associated requirement to surrender or repay units or to transfer units to a Crown holding account under [section 136][211] (or to pay any associated debt under [section 159][240]) has not been met in full.
    
    (4) Despite anything in this section, the EPA may remit any amount of interest that has accrued under this section, if the EPA is satisfied that---
        
    *   (a) the failure of the person to comply with the requirement to surrender or repay units or to transfer units to a Crown holding account under [section 136][211] and pay the penalty in full arises as a result of an event or a circumstance beyond the control of that person; and
    
    *   (b) as a consequence of that event or circumstance, the person has a reasonable justification or excuse for the non-compliance; and
    
    *   (c) the person corrected the failure to comply as soon as practicable.
    
    (5) Without limiting the EPA's discretion under subsection (4), an event or circumstance may include---
        
    *   (a) an accident or a disaster; or
    
    *   (b) illness or emotional or mental distress.
    
    (6) Despite anything in this section, the EPA may remit part of an amount of interest that has accrued under this section if the EPA is satisfied that it would be manifestly unfair or unjust to impose the full amount.
    
    (7) For the purposes of this section, an _event or circumstance_ does not include---
        
    *   (a) an act or omission of an agent of a person, unless the EPA is satisfied that the act or omission was caused by an event or circumstance beyond the control of the agent---
            
        *   (i) that could not have been anticipated; and
        
        *   (ii) the effect of which could not have been avoided by compliance with accepted standards of business organisation and professional conduct; or
        
        
    
    *   (b) a person's financial position.

    *   (a) have a holding account in the name of the consolidated group for the purposes of meeting the members' obligations under this Part and [Part 5][271]; and
    
    *   (b) record in that holding account the names of all the members of the consolidated group; and
    
    *   (c) submit a single annual emissions return for the consolidated group in respect of a year, which must---
            
        *   (i) meet the requirements of [section 65(2)][120] in respect of the activities listed in the notice under [section 150(4)(a)(ii)][228] or [151(2)(a)(ii)][229] carried out by each member of the consolidated group:

    (3) The liability of every member of the consolidated group to surrender units in respect of any year is met by the transfer of the units assessed in relation to the consolidated group from the consolidated group's holding account to a surrender account designated by the EPA.

    (5) The entitlement of every member of the consolidated group to be transferred units for removal activities in respect of any year must be met by the transfer of the number of units assessed in relation to the consolidated group to the consolidated group's holding account.
    
    (6) This section---
        
    *   (a) does not prevent the nominated entity submitting---
            
        *   (i) a quarterly emissions return under [section 66][121] for other removal activities of the consolidated group; or
        
        *   (ii) submitting an emissions return under [section 187][297] in respect of an entity who is a member of the consolidated group; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) applies with any necessary modifications to the period of an emissions return in either of those circumstances.
    
    (7) To avoid doubt, an emissions return for a consolidated group or any member of a consolidated group may be submitted only by the nominated entity of the consolidated group.

##### 178B Issuing New Zealand units to meet surrender obligations
    
*   (1) If, in accordance with [section 178A(2)(a)(ii) or (iii)][268], a person pays a sum of $25 instead of surrendering a unit that the person is liable to surrender, the Registrar must, when the funds are cleared,---
        
    *   (a) issue a number of New Zealand units into a Crown holding account equal to the number of units in respect of which the person has paid a sum of $25 for each unit; and
    
    *   (b) transfer the New Zealand units into the person's holding account held for the purpose of [section 61(1)][114]; and
    
    *   (c) immediately following the transfer under paragraph (b), transfer the New Zealand units to a surrender account designated by the EPA.
    
    (2) The Registrar may, for the purposes of subsection (1)(a), issue a number of New Zealand units equal to the number of units in respect of which 1 or more persons have paid a sum of $25 for each unit under [section 178A(2)(a)(ii) or (iii)][726].
    
    (3) If the EPA is required to reimburse a person units under [section 123(4)][727], [186H][728], or [189(7)(d)][729] and has satisfied its obligation to do so by paying to the person a sum of $25 for each unit in accordance with [section 178A(2)(b)(ii) or (iii)][726], then the Registrar must---
        
    *   (a) transfer from the appropriate surrender account to the person's holding account held for the purpose of [section 61(1)][114] a number of New Zealand units equal to the number of units for which the EPA paid the person a sum of $25 for each unit; and
    
    *   (b) immediately following the transfer under paragraph (a), transfer the New Zealand units from the person's holding account to a cancellation account.
    
    (4) For the avoidance of doubt, [section 68][124] does not apply in respect of any New Zealand units issued under this section.
    
    (5) If subsection (1) applies, this Act applies with any necessary modification as if the payment of $25 for a unit by a person and the transfer of a unit to a surrender account by the Registrar under this section were a surrender of a unit by the person.
    
    (6) Despite anything in [section 18CA(4)][39], a New Zealand unit that is transferred to a surrender account under subsection (1)(c) may be further transferred in accordance with subsection (3)(a).

        *   (iii) submitted in the prescribed manner and format.
        
        
    
    (6) If a person submits an emissions return under subsection (4) that covers a carbon accounting area in respect of a period for which a return has already been submitted under subsection (3), the return submitted under subsection (4) must---
        
    *   (a) record the number of units transferred for removals or surrendered for emissions in respect of the carbon accounting area in respect of the return or returns submitted under subsection (3); and
    
    *   (b) contain an assessment of the difference between---
            
        *   (i) the net number of units transferred for removals or surrendered for emissions from the carbon accounting area in respect of the return or returns submitted under subsection (3) (which must be determined by subtracting the number of units surrendered for emissions from the carbon accounting area from the number of units transferred in respect of removals from the carbon accounting area); and
        
        *   (ii) the gross number of units assessed as the participant's liability to surrender or entitlement to receive in respect of the carbon accounting area under the return submitted under subsection (4) as recorded under subsection (5)(a)(iii).
        
        
    
    (7) If the assessment referred to in subsection (6)(b) shows that the person would be---
        
    *   (a) entitled to fewer units for removals from the carbon accounting area in respect of the return submitted under subsection (4) than the net units that have been transferred in respect of returns under subsection (3), the person is liable to repay the number of units transferred in excess of the entitlement in the return under subsection (4); or
    
    *   (b) entitled to receive more units for removals from the carbon accounting area in respect of the return submitted under subsection (4) than the net number of units that have been transferred in respect of returns under subsection (3), the person is entitled to receive the number of units that is the difference between the entitlement in respect of the return under subsection (4) and the net number of units already transferred in respect of returns under subsection (3); or
    
    *   (c) liable to surrender more units for emissions from the carbon accounting area in respect of the return submitted under subsection (4) than the net number of units already surrendered in respect of returns under subsection (3), the person is liable to surrender the number of units that is the difference between the net number surrendered and the number assessed as being required to be surrendered under the return under subsection (4); or
    
    *   (d) liable to surrender fewer units for emissions from the carbon accounting area in respect of the return submitted under subsection (4) than the net number of units already surrendered in respect of returns under subsection (3), the EPA must arrange for reimbursement to the person, in accordance with [section 124][197], of the number of units that is the difference between the net number surrendered and the number assessed as being required to be surrendered under the return under subsection (4).
    
    (7A) Subsections (6) and (7) apply to a return submitted under subsection (4A) as if it were a return submitted under subsection (4).
    
    (8) A person who submits an emissions return under this section---
        
    *   (a) may include in the return an assessment of the person's net liability to surrender or repay units, or the person's net entitlement to New Zealand units, calculated by determining the difference between the total number of units required to be surrendered for emissions from each of the carbon accounting areas covered by the return (or, if relevant, required to be repaid in respect of the carbon accounting areas covered by the return) and the total number of New Zealand units to which the person is entitled in respect of removals from each of the carbon accounting areas covered by the return (or, if relevant, is entitled to be reimbursed in respect of carbon accounting areas covered by the return); and
    
    *   (b) may elect to surrender or repay the net number of units for which the person is liable, or to receive the net number of New Zealand units to which the person is entitled, as determined under paragraph (a); and
    
    *   (c) must, if the person makes an election under paragraph (b), indicate clearly in the return that such an election has been made; and
    
    *   (d) must, if an assessment in the emissions return shows a liability or a net liability to---
            
        *   (i) surrender units, surrender those units within 20 working days of submitting the emissions return; or
        
        *   (ii) repay units, repay those units, by transferring the number of units required to be transferred, within 60 working days of submitting the emissions return, to a Crown holding account designated by the EPA, and the provisions of [sections 134][208] and [135][210] apply, with any necessary modifications, as if---
                
            *   (A) the units the person is required to repay were units transferred to the person in error; and
            
            *   (B) the requirement to repay the units arose under [section 125][198].
            
            
        
        
    
    (8A) Despite subsection (8)(d), a person who submits an emissions return under this section that shows a liability or a net liability is under no obligation to surrender units if---
        
    *   (a) the emissions return is in respect of post-1989 forest land; and
    
    *   (b) that land is affected by a natural event that permanently prevents re-establishing a forest on that land.

##### 190 Special rules regarding surrender of units in relation to post-1989 forest land
    
*   (1) Despite [section 63][116], a person who is or was a participant in respect of an activity listed in [Part 1][429] of Schedule 4 is not liable to surrender more units in relation to any carbon accounting area or part of a carbon accounting area than the unit balance of that carbon accounting area or part of a carbon accounting area.
    
    (2) The unit balance of a carbon accounting area must be calculated in accordance with the following formula:
    
    UB = (A -- B) + OUB
    
    where---
    
    **UB**
    > 
    > is the unit balance of the carbon accounting area
    
    **A**
    > 
    > is the net number of New Zealand units transferred for removals from the carbon accounting area since the date it was constituted (that is, the number of units transferred for removals less any units repaid under [section 123(6)][196] or [189(8)][301])
    
    **B**
    > 
    > is the net number of New Zealand units surrendered for emissions from the carbon accounting area since the date it was constituted (that is, the number of units surrendered, less any units reimbursed under [section 124][197] or [189(7)][301])
    
    **OUB**
    > 
    > is,---
    >     
    > *   (a) if the carbon accounting area is constituted from land from another carbon accounting area (following the removal of land from a carbon accounting area, or transmission of an interest as defined in [section 192][304]), the opening unit balance of the carbon accounting area, as determined in accordance with subsection (3); or
    > 
    > *   (b) if the carbon accounting area is not constituted as described in paragraph (a), but is constituted from land that was subject to a forest sink covenant under [section 67ZD][753] of the Forests Act 1949, the net number of units transferred in respect of the land in the carbon accounting area while it was the subject of the forest sink covenant; or
    > 
    > *   (c) if the carbon accounting area is not constituted from land from another carbon accounting area or land that was subject to a forest sink covenant, zero.
    > 
    > 
    
    (3) The following provisions apply if a person is required by this subpart to calculate the unit balance of a newly constituted carbon accounting area:
        
    *   (a) if a carbon accounting area (**CAA2**) has been constituted under [section 192(3)(b)(iii)][304] from the land remaining in an affected carbon accounting area (**CAA1**) following transmission of an interest in part of the CAA1, the person must calculate the opening unit balance of CAA2 in accordance with subsection (4), and for the purposes of that calculation---
            
        *   (i) H is the number of hectares of post-1989 forest land in CAA1; and
        
        *   (ii) Hp is the number of hectares of post-1989 forest land in CAA2; and
        
        *   (iii) UB is the unit balance of CAA1 calculated in accordance with subsection (2) (and includes any units transferred or surrendered in respect of the removals or emissions reported in the emissions return submitted under [section 193(1)][305]); and
        
        *   (iv) UBp is the opening unit balance for CAA2 for the purposes of subsection (2):
        
        
    
    *   (b) if a carbon accounting area (**CAA2**) has been constituted under [section 188(7)(b)(ii)(B)][299] from the land remaining in a carbon accounting area (**CAA1**) because the person has removed land from CAA1 or ceased carrying out an activity listed in [Part 1][429] of Schedule 4 in respect of part of CAA1, the opening unit balance of CAA2 is the figure calculated under [section 191(4)][303] for UBr for the purposes of the person's emissions return under section 191(3):
    
    *   (c) if a carbon accounting area (**CAA2**) has been constituted by operation of [section 192(3)(b)(ii)][304], the person must calculate the opening unit balance of CAA2 by---
            
        *   (i) calculating the unit balance of any whole carbon accounting areas that form part of CAA2 in accordance with subsection (2), including (but not limited to) any units transferred or surrendered in respect of the removals or emissions reported in the emissions return under [section 193(1)][305]; and
        
        *   (ii) calculating the unit balance of any part carbon accounting area that forms part of CAA2 in accordance with subsection (4), and for the purposes of that calculation---
                
            *   (A) H is the number of hectares of post-1989 forest land in the carbon accounting area of which the part carbon accounting area formed a part before the transmission of the interest; and
            
            *   (B) Hp is the number of hectares of post-1989 forest land in the part carbon accounting area; and
            
            *   (C) UB is the unit balance of the carbon accounting area of which the part carbon accounting area formed a part before the transmission of the interest, including (but not limited to) any units transferred or surrendered in respect of the removals or emissions reported in the emissions return under [section 193(1)][305]; and
            
            
        
        *   (iii) adding together the unit balances obtained under subparagraphs (i) and (ii).
        
        
    
    (4) The unit balance of part of a carbon accounting area must be calculated in accordance with the following formula:
    
    UBp = UB/H × Hp
    
    where---
    
    **UBp**
    > 
    > is the unit balance of the part of the carbon accounting area
    
    **UB**
    > 
    > is the unit balance of the carbon accounting area of which the part carbon accounting area formed a part, calculated in accordance with subsection (2)
    
    **H**
    > 
    > is the number of hectares in the carbon accounting area of which the part carbon accounting area formed a part
    
    **Hp**
    > 
    > is the number of hectares in the part of the carbon accounting area for which a unit balance is calculated.
    
    (5) For the purposes of this section,---
        
    *   (a) units transferred for removals, surrendered, repaid, or reimbursed in respect of a carbon accounting area include units that a person would have been entitled to receive, or would have been required to surrender or repay, in respect of a carbon accounting area, but which were not actually transferred, surrendered, repaid, or reimbursed because of an election under [section 189(8)][301]; and
    
    *   (b) the date that a carbon accounting area is constituted is---
            
        *   (i) the date the person's registration as a participant in respect of the activity in the application took effect in accordance with [section 57(8)][110] for a carbon accounting area defined in an application referred to in [section 188(1)][299]; and
        
        *   (ii) the date the participant's record is updated under [section 188(6) or (7)][299] for a carbon accounting area where land has been removed from a carbon accounting area, a person has ceased to carry out the activity on part of a carbon accounting area, or a person has applied to add a carbon accounting area under section 188(3)(a)(i); and
        
        *   (iii) the date the carbon accounting area was constituted under that section for a carbon accounting area constituted by operation of [section 192(3)(b)][304]; and

    _The Parties to this Convention,_
    
    _Acknowledging_ that change in the Earth's climate and its adverse effects are a common concern of humankind,
    
    _Concerned_ that human activities have been substantially increasing the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, that these increases enhance the natural greenhouse effect, and that this will result on average in an additional warming of the Earth's surface and atmosphere and may adversely affect natural ecosystems and humankind,
    
    _Noting_ that the largest share of historical and current global emissions of greenhouse gases has originated in developed countries, that per capita emissions in developing countries are still relatively low and that the share of global emissions originating in developing countries will grow to meet their social and development needs,
    
    _Aware_ of the role and importance in terrestrial and marine ecosystems of sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases,
    
    _Noting_ that there are many uncertainties in predictions of climate change, particularly with regard to the timing, magnitude and regional patterns thereof,
    
    _Acknowledging_ that the global nature of climate change calls for the widest possible cooperation by all countries and their participation in an effective and appropriate international response, in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities and their social and economic conditions,
    
    _Recalling_ the pertinent provisions of the Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, adopted at Stockholm on 16 June 1972,
    
    _Recalling also_ that States have, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, the sovereign right to exploit their own resources pursuant to their own environmental and developmental policies, and the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction,
    
    _Reaffirming_ the principle of sovereignty of States in international cooperation to address climate change,
    
    _Recognizing_ that States should enact effective environmental legislation, that environmental standards, management objectives and priorities should reflect the environmental and developmental context to which they apply, and that standards applied by some countries may be inappropriate and of unwarranted economic and social cost to other countries, in particular developing countries,
    
    _Recalling_ the provisions of General Assembly resolution 44/228 of 22 December 1989 on the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, and resolutions 43/53 of 6 December 1988, 44/207 of 22 December 1989, 45/212 of 21 December 1990 and 46/169 of 19 December 1991 on protection of global climate for present and future generations of mankind,
    
    _Recalling also_ the provisions of General Assembly resolution 44/206 of 22 December 1989 on the possible adverse effects of sea-level rise on islands and coastal areas, particularly low-lying coastal areas and the pertinent provisions of General Assembly resolution 44/172 of 19 December 1989 on the implementation of the Plan of Action to Combat Desertification,
    
    _Recalling further_ the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer, 1985, and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, 1987, as adjusted and amended on 29 June 1990,
    
    _Noting_ the Ministerial Declaration of the Second World Climate Conference adopted on 7 November 1990,
    
    _Conscious_ of the valuable analytical work being conducted by many States on climate change and of the important contributions of the World Meteorological Organization, the United Nations Environment Programme and other organs, organizations and bodies of the United Nations system, as well as other international and intergovernmental bodies, to the exchange of results of scientific research and the coordination of research,
    
    _Recognizing_ that steps required to understand and address climate change will be environmentally, socially and economically most effective if they are based on relevant scientific, technical and economic considerations and continually re-evaluated in the light of new findings in these areas,
    
    _Recognizing_ that various actions to address climate change can be justified economically in their own right and can also help in solving other environmental problems,
    
    _Recognizing also_ the need for developed countries to take immediate action in a flexible manner on the basis of clear priorities, as a first step towards comprehensive response strategies at the global, national and, where agreed, regional levels that take into account all greenhouse gases, with due consideration of their relative contributions to the enhancement of the greenhouse effect,
    
    _Recognizing further_ that low-lying and other small island countries, countries with low-lying coastal, arid and semi-arid areas or areas liable to floods, drought and desertification, and developing countries with fragile mountainous ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change,
    
    _Recognizing_ the special difficulties of those countries, especially developing countries, whose economies are particularly dependent on fossil fuel production, use and exportation, as a consequence of action taken on limiting greenhouse gas emissions,
    
    _Affirming_ that responses to climate change should be coordinated with social and economic development in an integrated manner with a view to avoiding adverse impacts on the latter, taking into full account the legitimate priority needs of developing countries for the achievement of sustained economic growth and the eradication of poverty,
    
    _Recognizing_ that all countries, especially developing countries, need access to resources required to achieve sustainable social and economic development and that, in order for developing countries to progress towards that goal, their energy consumption will need to grow taking into account the possibilities for achieving greater energy efficiency and for controlling greenhouse gas emissions in general, including through the application of new technologies on terms which make such an application economically and socially beneficial,
    
    _Determined_ to protect the climate system for present and future generations,
    
    _Have agreed as follows:_

## Article 1  
Definitions[1][806]

For the purposes of this Convention:
    
*   1\. "Adverse effects of climate change" means changes in the physical environment or biota resulting from climate change which have significant deleterious effects on the composition, resilience or productivity of natural and managed ecosystems or on the operation of socio-economic systems or on human health and welfare.

*   2\. "Climate change" means a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods.

*   3\. "Climate system" means the totality of the atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere and geosphere and their interactions.

*   4\. "Emissions" means the release of greenhouse gases and/or their precursors into the atmosphere over a specified area and period of time.

*   5\. "Greenhouse gases" means those gaseous constituents of the atmosphere, both natural and anthropogenic, that absorb and re-emit infrared radiation.

*   6\. "Regional economic integration organization" means an organization constituted by sovereign States of a given region which has competence in respect of matters governed by this Convention or its protocols and has been duly authorized, in accordance with its internal procedures, to sign, ratify, accept, approve or accede to the instruments concerned.

*   7\. "Reservoir" means a component or components of the climate system where a greenhouse gas or a precursor of a greenhouse gas is stored.

*   8\. "Sink" means any process, activity or mechanism which removes a greenhouse gas, an aerosol or a precursor of a greenhouse gas from the atmosphere.

*   9\. "Source" means any process or activity which releases a greenhouse gas, an aerosol or a precursor of a greenhouse gas into the atmosphere.

## Article 2  
Objective

The ultimate objective of this Convention and any related legal instruments that the Conference of the Parties may adopt is to achieve, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Convention, stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Such a level should be achieved within a time-frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner.

## Article 3  
Principles

In their actions to achieve the objective of the Convention and to implement its provisions, the Parties shall be guided, _inter alia_, by the following:
    
*   1\. The Parties should protect the climate system for the benefit of present and future generations of humankind, on the basis of equity and in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. Accordingly, the developed country Parties should take the lead in combating climate change and the adverse effects thereof.

*   2\. The specific needs and special circumstances of developing country Parties, especially those that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, and of those Parties, especially developing country Parties, that would have to bear a disproportionate or abnormal burden under the Convention, should be given full consideration.

*   3\. The Parties should take precautionary measures to anticipate, prevent or minimize the causes of climate change and mitigate its adverse effects. Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing such measures, taking into account that policies and measures to deal with climate change should be cost-effective so as to ensure global benefits at the lowest possible cost. To achieve this, such policies and measures should take into account different socio-economic contexts, be comprehensive, cover all relevant sources, sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases and adaptation, and comprise all economic sectors. Efforts to address climate change may be carried out cooperatively by interested Parties.

*   4\. The Parties have a right to, and should, promote sustainable development. Policies and measures to protect the climate system against human-induced change should be appropriate for the specific conditions of each Party and should be integrated with national development programmes, taking into account that economic development is essential for adopting measures to address climate change.

*   5\. The Parties should cooperate to promote a supportive and open international economic system that would lead to sustainable economic growth and development in all Parties, particularly developing country Parties, thus enabling them better to address the problems of climate change. Measures taken to combat climate change, including unilateral ones, should not constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination or a disguised restriction on international trade.

## Article 4  
Commitments
    
*   1\. All Parties, taking into account their common but differentiated responsibilities and their specific national and regional development priorities, objectives and circumstances, shall:
        
    *   (a) Develop, periodically update, publish and make available to the Conference of the Parties, in accordance with [Article 12][451], national inventories of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol, using comparable methodologies to be agreed upon by the Conference of the Parties;
    
    *   (b) Formulate, implement, publish and regularly update national and, where appropriate, regional programmes containing measures to mitigate climate change by addressing anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol, and measures to facilitate adequate adaptation to climate change;
    
    *   (c) Promote and cooperate in the development, application and diffusion, including transfer, of technologies, practices and processes that control, reduce or prevent anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol in all relevant sectors, including the energy, transport, industry, agriculture, forestry and waste management sectors;
    
    *   (d) Promote sustainable management, and promote and cooperate in the conservation and enhancement, as appropriate, of sinks and reservoirs of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol, including biomass, forests and oceans as well as other terrestrial, coastal and marine ecosystems;
    
    *   (e) Cooperate in preparing for adaptation to the impacts of climate change; develop and elaborate appropriate and integrated plans for coastal zone management, water resources and agriculture, and for the protection and rehabilitation of areas, particularly in Africa, affected by drought and desertification, as well as floods;
    
    *   (f) Take climate change considerations into account, to the extent feasible, in their relevant social, economic and environmental policies and actions, and employ appropriate methods, for example impact assessments, formulated and determined nationally, with a view to minimizing adverse effects on the economy, on public health and on the quality of the environment, of projects or measures undertaken by them to mitigate or adapt to climate change;
    
    *   (g) Promote and cooperate in scientific, technological, technical, socio-economic and other research, systematic observation and development of data archives related to the climate system and intended to further the understanding and to reduce or eliminate the remaining uncertainties regarding the causes, effects, magnitude and timing of climate change and the economic and social consequences of various response strategies;
    
    *   (h) Promote and cooperate in the full, open and prompt exchange of relevant scientific, technological, technical, socio-economic and legal information related to the climate system and climate change, and to the economic and social consequences of various response strategies;

    *   (j) Communicate to the Conference of the Parties information related to implementation, in accordance with [Article 12][451].
    
    

*   2\. The developed country Parties and other Parties included in [Annex I][465] commit themselves specifically as provided for in the following:
        
    *   (a) Each of these Parties shall adopt national[2][807] policies and take corresponding measures on the mitigation of climate change, by limiting its anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases and protecting and enhancing its greenhouse gas sinks and reservoirs. These policies and measures will demonstrate that developed countries are taking the lead in modifying longer-term trends in anthropogenic emissions consistent with the objective of the Convention, recognizing that the return by the end of the present decade to earlier levels of anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol would contribute to such modification, and taking into account the differences in these Parties' starting points and approaches, economic structures and resource bases, the need to maintain strong and sustainable economic growth, available technologies and other individual circumstances, as well as the need for equitable and appropriate contributions by each of these Parties to the global effort regarding that objective. These Parties may implement such policies and measures jointly with other Parties and may assist other Parties in contributing to the achievement of the objective of the Convention and, in particular, that of this subparagraph;
    
    *   (b) In order to promote progress to this end, each of these Parties shall communicate, within six months of the entry into force of the Convention for it and periodically thereafter, and in accordance with [Article 12][451], detailed information on its policies and measures referred to in subparagraph (a) above, as well as on its resulting projected anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol for the period referred to in subparagraph (a), with the aim of returning individually or jointly to their 1990 levels these anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol. This information will be reviewed by the Conference of the Parties, at its first session and periodically thereafter, in accordance with [Article 7][808];
    
    *   (c) Calculations of emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases for the purposes of subparagraph (b) above should take into account the best available scientific knowledge, including of the effective capacity of sinks and the respective contributions of such gases to climate change. The Conference of the Parties shall consider and agree on methodologies for these calculations at its first session and review them regularly thereafter;
    
    *   (d) The Conference of the Parties shall, at its first session, review the adequacy of subparagraphs (a) and (b) above. Such review shall be carried out in the light of the best available scientific information and assessment on climate change and its impacts, as well as relevant technical, social and economic information. Based on this review, the Conference of the Parties shall take appropriate action, which may include the adoption of amendments to the commitments in subparagraphs (a) and (b) above. The Conference of the Parties, at its first session, shall also take decisions regarding criteria for joint implementation as indicated in subparagraph (a) above. A second review of subparagraphs (a) and (b) shall take place not later than 31 December 1998, and thereafter at regular intervals determined by the Conference of the Parties, until the objective of the Convention is met;
    
    *   (e) Each of these Parties shall:
            
        *   (i) Coordinate as appropriate with other such Parties, relevant economic and administrative instruments developed to achieve the objective of the Convention; and
        
        *   (ii) Identify and periodically review its own policies and practices which encourage activities that lead to greater levels of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol than would otherwise occur;
        
        
    
    *   (f) The Conference of the Parties shall review, not later than 31 December 1998, available information with a view to taking decisions regarding such amendments to the lists in [Annexes I][465] and [II][809] as may be appropriate, with the approval of the Party concerned;
    
    *   (g) Any Party not included in [Annex I][465] may, in its instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, or at any time thereafter, notify the Depositary that it intends to be bound by subparagraphs (a) and (b) above. The Depositary shall inform the other signatories and Parties of any such notification.
    
    

*   3\. The developed country Parties and other developed Parties included in [Annex II][809] shall provide new and additional financial resources to meet the agreed full costs incurred by developing country Parties in complying with their obligations under [Article 12][451], paragraph 1\. They shall also provide such financial resources, including for the transfer of technology, needed by the developing country Parties to meet the agreed full incremental costs of implementing measures that are covered by paragraph 1 of this Article and that are agreed between a developing country Party and the international entity or entities referred to in [Article 11][810], in accordance with that Article. The implementation of these commitments shall take into account the need for adequacy and predictability in the flow of funds and the importance of appropriate burden sharing among the developed country Parties.

*   4\. The developed country Parties and other developed Parties included in [Annex II][809] shall also assist the developing country Parties that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change in meeting costs of adaptation to those adverse effects.

*   5\. The developed country Parties and other developed Parties included in [Annex II][809] shall take all practicable steps to promote, facilitate and finance, as appropriate, the transfer of, or access to, environmentally sound technologies and know-how to other Parties, particularly developing country Parties, to enable them to implement the provisions of the Convention. In this process, the developed country Parties shall support the development and enhancement of endogenous capacities and technologies of developing country Parties. Other Parties and organizations in a position to do so may also assist in facilitating the transfer of such technologies.

*   6\. In the implementation of their commitments under paragraph 2 above, a certain degree of flexibility shall be allowed by the Conference of the Parties to the Parties included in [Annex I][465] undergoing the process of transition to a market economy, in order to enhance the ability of these Parties to address climate change, including with regard to the historical level of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol chosen as a reference.

*   7\. The extent to which developing country Parties will effectively implement their commitments under the Convention will depend on the effective implementation by developed country Parties of their commitments under the Convention related to financial resources and transfer of technology and will take fully into account that economic and social development and poverty eradication are the first and overriding priorities of the developing country Parties.

*   8\. In the implementation of the commitments in this Article, the Parties shall give full consideration to what actions are necessary under the Convention, including actions related to funding, insurance and the transfer of technology, to meet the specific needs and concerns of developing country Parties arising from the adverse effects of climate change and/or the impact of the implementation of response measures, especially on:
        
    *   (a) Small island countries;
    
    *   (b) Countries with low-lying coastal areas;
    
    *   (c) Countries with arid and semi-arid areas, forested areas and areas liable to forest decay;
    
    *   (d) Countries with areas prone to natural disasters;

    *   (h) Countries whose economies are highly dependent on income generated from the production, processing and export, and/or on consumption of fossil fuels and associated energy-intensive products; and
    
    *   (i) Land-locked and transit countries.
    
    Further, the Conference of the Parties may take actions, as appropriate, with respect to this paragraph.

*   9\. The Parties shall take full account of the specific needs and special situations of the least developed countries in their actions with regard to funding and transfer of technology.

*   10\. The Parties shall, in accordance with [Article 10][811], take into consideration in the implementation of the commitments of the Convention the situation of Parties, particularly developing country Parties, with economies that are vulnerable to the adverse effects of the implementation of measures to respond to climate change. This applies notably to Parties with economies that are highly dependent on income generated from the production, processing and export, and/or consumption of fossil fuels and associated energy-intensive products and/or the use of fossil fuels for which such Parties have serious difficulties in switching to alternatives.

## Article 5  
Research and systematic observation
    
*   In carrying out their commitments under [Article 4][812], paragraph 1(g), the Parties shall:

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Climate Change Response Act 2002\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 January 2013, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][840] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][841] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][842] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][843] and [17E][844] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
