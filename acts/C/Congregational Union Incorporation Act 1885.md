##### 1 Short Title
    
*   The Short Title of this Act is The Congregational Union Incorporation Act 1885\.

##### 2 Interpretation of the word **church.**
    
*   In this Act the word _church_ shall mean the persons for the time being united together in fellowship forming a Christian church of the Congregational or Independent denomination, and called **church members;** and throughout this Act the said word **church** refers to the churches severally in different localities who may seek to take advantage of this Act for the purpose of conveying or transferring their lands or buildings to the body corporate hereinafter mentioned.

##### 3 Union incorporated
    
*   All persons who are or may become members of the religious body or denomination of Congregationalists or Independents, and who compose the association called **The Congregational Union of New Zealand,** from henceforth shall be a body corporate by the name of **The Congregational Union of New Zealand,** and shall have perpetual succession and a common seal, and under that name may sue and be sued, prosecute and defend, and take all other proceedings in all Courts, civil and criminal, within the said colony, and it shall be lawful for the said body corporate to make by-laws and such alterations in the constitution of the said body corporate as may be found from time to time necessary, and it shall be further lawful for the said body corporate to take, purchase, receive, hold, and enjoy real and personal property of any description whatsoever, and also to sell, grant, convey, demise, or otherwise dispose of, either absolutely or by way of mortgage, any of the property, real or personal, belonging to the said body corporate, and generally to exercise, subject to the provisions of this Act, all powers incident to a body corporate; and the executive committee for the time being of the said association shall have the custody and use of the common seal of the said body corporate, and a majority of the members of such committee present at any meeting shall have power to use or direct the use of such seal for all purposes for which the use of such seal is required.

##### 4 Trustees of lands, &c, held on trust for Independents or Congregationalists empowered to convey to the Union
    
*   All persons who now hold or in whom are vested lands or buildings within the said colony as trustees in trust for the said body or denomination called Independents or Congregationalists, or for any church connected therewith, under any deed or deeds, may, subject to the proviso hereinafter contained, convey or transfer the same to the said body corporate, and the same shall thereafter be held by the said body corporate under and subject to the trusts set forth and specified in Schedule [C][11] hereto, and the trusts under which such lands or buildings had been theretofore held shall thereupon cease and determine.
    
    And it is further enacted that if any of the said trustees should at the time of the execution of such conveyances be absent from the said colony, then any of his co-trustees may act as his attorney and sign and execute any such conveyance for every such trustee so absent from the colony as aforesaid, and such signature and execution shall have the same effect as if the conveyance was signed and executed by the trustee so absent from the colony as aforesaid.

##### 5 No such conveyance to be made until consent and direction of majority of church members obtained
    
*   Provided that such trustees shall not make any such conveyance as aforesaid to the said body corporate until they have first obtained the consent and direction of the majority of the church members in trust for whom such lands are held, present at a meeting duly convened as hereinafter mentioned for that object, and such meeting shall be called by a notice of the object of such meeting, together with the day, hour, and place of holding such meeting, which notice shall be signed by the pastor for the time being, or in case of his neglect for fourteen days, or absolute refusal after request in writing made by five members of the church, or in case of there being no pastor, then by the same number of members, and be posted on the door of the church building used for public worship on or in connection with the said lands on at least two successive Sundays immediately preceding the day on which such meeting shall be appointed to take place, and shall, if practicable, be read during some part of each of the public services held on the same two Sundays in such church building, and that no direction or consent shall be considered to have been given until such meeting shall have been called in the way prescribed, and the majority of the church members present and voting at such meeting shall have passed a resolution directing such conveyance to be made.

##### 6 Members entitled to vote
    
*   Only the members present at any such meeting of the age of twenty-one years and upwards shall be allowed to vote, and no person who shall have been admitted as an occasional communicant or who shall not have been a member of the church and shall not have been so inscribed on the church books for the space of three calendar months immediately prior to such meeting, shall be entitled to vote or take any part in any of the church matters aforesaid.

##### 7 Who to be chairman of meeting
    
*   The chairman of every such meeting as aforesaid shall be the pastor of the church, or in case of his refusal, absence, or incapacity, or of there being no pastor, then a person chosen by the major part of the members present at the meeting, and the chairman of such meeting shall have a deliberative vote, and in case of an equality of votes on any question, shall have a casting vote.
