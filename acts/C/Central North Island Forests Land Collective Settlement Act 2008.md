*   #### Preamble
    
    (1) The historical CNI forests land claims made by the Central North Island iwi to the Central North Island (_CNI_) forests land are based on historical breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi by the Crown and the desire of those iwi to secure the return of that land and to achieve an enduring settlement of those claims:
    
    (2) The Crown and the CNI Iwi Collective have agreed to negotiate in good faith in accordance with the framework and principles of the Crown Forests Agreement that was entered into on 20 July 1989 between representatives of Māori and the Crown and the Crown Forest Assets Act 1989, in order to reach a fair and durable settlement of those historical claims:
    
    (3) The Crown and the CNI Iwi Collective have made significant progress towards reaching a collective settlement, and the Crown has therefore agreed to facilitate the completion of that settlement by vesting the CNI forests land in a company, to be known as CNI Iwi Holdings Limited. The company will act as trustee of the CNI Iwi Holdings Trust and will hold and administer the CNI forests land for the CNI Iwi Collective and the Crown in accordance with this Act, the deed of settlement between the CNI Iwi Collective and the Crown, and a deed of trust:
    
    (4) Under the terms of that deed of trust, 90% of the beneficial interest in the CNI forests land is to be held for the CNI Iwi Collective and the individual beneficial entitlement of each member of that Collective is to be determined by reference to the allocation process that has been agreed amongst those members and is set out in this Act. The remaining 10% of the beneficial interest in the CNI forests land is to be held for the Crown for a period of 6 years beginning on the date of vesting of the land in the company. The Crown agreed proportion will allow claims to the forests land by other CNI claimants who are not represented by the CNI Iwi Collective to be settled during that period of 6 years.

##### 2 Principles of resolution process

    *   (a) enhances and promotes the mana and integrity of all iwi; and
    
    *   (b) is open and transparent; and
    
    *   (c) promotes whanaungatanga, manaakitanga, and kotahitanga amongst the iwi; and

    (4) Allocation of CNI forests land will be to iwi only, or their nominees (acknowledging that it is up to iwi whether they make their own internal arrangements with hapū or other entities).
    
    (5) The CNI Iwi Collective acknowledges its intention to respect any existing arrangements between iwi and district or regional councils, Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga, or Crown forestry licensees.
    
    Schedule 2 clause 2(5): amended, on 20 May 2014, by [section 107][100] of the Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga Act 2014 (2014 No 26).

##### 3 Governance of process

    (2) The resolution process will be governed by the company and the governance entities, in their capacity as shareholders in the company. 
    
    (3) The governance entities may amend the resolution process from time to time by unanimous resolution, passed in accordance with the procedures set out in the deed of trust.
    
    (4) The company may appoint individuals or committees to undertake particular roles in relation to the resolution process.
    
    (5) The Crown appointed observer to the company is not entitled to attend meetings concerning the resolution process unless they are relevant to the Crown agreed proportion.
    
    (6) The resolution process will be run with set time frames for each stage and be completed by 1 July 2011\.

##### 4 Stage 1: Identification of mana whenua interests: 1 July 2009 to 1 October 2009
    
*   (1) By 31 August 2009, each iwi will provide maps to the company indicating the extent of their mana whenua interests over the CNI forests land. The area of interest claimed is not constrained by the current legal boundaries of the CNI Crown forestry licence blocks.
    
    (2) The test of mana whenua is the mana that iwi traditionally held and exercised over the land, determined according to tikanga including, but not limited to, such factors as---
        
    *   (a) take whenua; and
    
    *   (b) demonstration of ahi kā roa, ahi tahutahu, or ahi mātaotao.
    
    (3) Evidence of mana whenua may be derived from whatever sources of knowledge that each iwi considers relevant, including---
        
    *   (a) oral korero, including whakapapa, waiata, and tribal history; and
    
    *   (b) written sources, including Native Land Court evidence and decisions, research reports, and other records.
    
    (4) The company will provide all iwi with a full set of the maps provided under subclause (1). The maps will be confidential to the company and the iwi, and may not be disclosed to third parties or used for any other purpose.
    
    (5) By 30 September 2009, the board of the company will identify, based on the maps provided by the iwi under subclause (1) and advice from the Crown,---
        
    *   (a) the areas of CNI forests land in which a particular iwi has exclusive mana whenua interests; and
    
    *   (b) the extent to which there is agreement on allocation of particular areas of CNI forests land to particular iwi. Agreements must be in writing and signed by authorised representatives of the governance entities of each of the iwi that had claimed mana whenua interests; and
    
    *   (c) areas of land for which agreement has not been reached, and the iwi that are claiming that land; and
    
    *   (d) areas of land that the Crown has advised are or may be subject to claims by other CNI claimants to the Crown agreed proportion. 
    
    (6) Areas of CNI forests land that may be subject to the Crown agreed proportion cannot proceed through the resolution process or be included in the Collective's final allocation agreement unless and until the Crown has confirmed that the area of land is not part of the Crown agreed proportion. If the Crown does so confirm, the CNI forests land will be subject to the resolution process provided for in this schedule, with any appropriate modifications to the time lines and process determined by the board of the company.
    
    (7) Subject to subclause (6), the company will record in its draft final allocation agreement the agreed allocations under subclause (5)(a) and (b). 
    
    (8) Subject to subclause (6), all CNI forests land for which allocation is not agreed will be the subject of the Stage 2 process of negotiation between iwi kanohi ki te kanohi.

##### 5 Stage 2: Kanohi ki te kanohi negotiation: 1 October 2009 to 30 June 2010
    
*   (1) Following Stage 1, iwi must embark on kanohi ki te kanohi negotiations with iwi with whom they have overlapping claims, to reach agreement on allocation of the CNI forests land in question.
    
    (2) The process will be kanohi ki te kanohi between iwi and---
        
    *   (a) the iwi involved will determine the tikanga that applies to the process; and
    
    *   (b) the governance entity of each iwi will appoint their representatives to engage in the Stage 2 process; and
    
    *   (c) the expectation is of kōrero rangatira (open principled trustworthy dialogue by rangatira with authority to commit their iwi); and
    
    *   (d) no expert advisors, including lawyers and historians, are permitted to participate directly in the kanohi ki te kanohi negotiations.
    
    (3) The iwi concerned in each process will endeavour to reach consensus on the allocation of the CNI forests land in question, having regard to the strength of the mana whenua interests. Innovative solutions that reflect tikanga, whanaungatanga, manaakitanga and kotahitanga, and the complexity of mana whenua interests could include, but are not limited to---
        
    *   (a) joint or multiple ownership of land as tenants in common, either divided in equal shares or proportionally according to the respective interests of the iwi; and
    
    *   (b) subdividing land and allocating the subdivided portions to each iwi; and
    
    *   (c) agreeing to ""exchange"" interests in more than 1 block, so that exclusive interests can be granted to each of the blocks; and
    
    *   (d) one iwi becoming the owner, but acknowledging the relationship of other iwi with the land in an agreed manner; and
    
    *   (e) agreeing not to transfer title of the land from the company, but acknowledging mana whenua interests in a manner agreed by the iwi.
    
    (4) Minutes of each hui will be taken and confirmed by the iwi participating.
    
    (5) Agreements reached during Stage 2 must be signed in writing by the governance entities of each iwi.
    
    (6) Throughout Stage 2, the board of the company will obtain regular reports from iwi on the progress of negotiations, and consider whether it can facilitate the resolution of any disputes with the agreement of the iwi concerned.
    
    (7) The iwi involved in each kanohi ki te kanohi process may request the appointment of mediators to assist in the Stage 2 process, as set out in [clause 6(7) to (9)][11].

##### 6 Stage 3: Finalising allocation agreement: 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2011
    
*   (1) On completion of Stage 2, the board of the company will prepare a further draft of the final allocation agreement, in which it records---
        
    *   (a) the agreements reached on allocation of CNI forests land during Stage 2; and
    
    *   (b) any remaining areas of CNI forests land for which agreement has not been reached amongst the iwi who claimed mana whenua interests in that area in the maps provided under [clause 4(1)][6] (_disputed land_).
    
    (2) The board of the company may only alter the agreements reached between iwi regarding the allocation of CNI forests land with the consent of the iwi concerned.
    
    (3) The iwi interested in the disputed land will decide whether to refer the dispute to---

    (4) If the iwi involved in the dispute cannot reach agreement on which process to follow under subclause (3) by 1 August 2010, the board of the company will decide.
    
    (5) If agreement is not reached through mediation by 30 November 2010, then the dispute will be determined by adjudication.
    
    (6) Following determination of the dispute over any disputed lands, the decision reached will be recorded in the final allocation agreement.
    
    ###### Mediation: to be completed by 30 November 2010
    
    (7) The board of the company may, on the following terms, appoint 1 or more mediators to mediate between the iwi and to endeavour to reach agreement over the disputed land:
        
    *   (a) the mediators should be fluent in te reo Māori, and have knowledge of, and be skilled in, tikanga based dispute resolution; and
    
    *   (b) the mediators must be independent of the dispute; and
    
    *   (c) the iwi concerned may nominate mediators, and must consent to the mediators to be appointed.
    
    (8) The mediators will decide, in conjunction with the iwi interested in the disputed land, the process to be followed in the mediation.

    (3) After 1 July 2011, on receiving a written request from a governance entity, the company will transfer the CNI forests land to that governance entity or nominee in accordance with the final allocation agreement and the deed of trust, provided that---
        
    *   (a) the Crown's consent is obtained as required by the deed of trust, if the transfer is prior to the expiry of the Crown initial period; and
    
    *   (b) the ongoing rentals and other income derived from the land will continue to be paid to the company and distributed according to the Collective's agreed proportions until the Collective's final allocation date (as defined in the deed of trust).

    (6) If agreement is reached not to transfer areas of the CNI forests land, or iwi do not request a transfer in writing, then the company will retain title, subject to the vested beneficial entitlement of iwi in accordance with the final allocation agreement and the deed of trust.
    
    (7) On completion of the Crown initial period, any remaining CNI forests land that is vested in the company in accordance with the deed of trust will be subject to the resolution process in this schedule, with any appropriate modifications to the time lines and process determined by the board of the company.
