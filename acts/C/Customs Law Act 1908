##### 204 Coastwise trade by ships of certain foreign countries
    
*   (1) If it appears to the Governor-General that Commonwealth ships are subject in any foreign country to any prohibition or restriction as to the carrying of passengers or goods coastwise in that country, he may, by Order in Council, so far as treaty obligations binding on Her Majesty's Government of New Zealand permit, impose such prohibitions or restrictions upon the ships of that country as to carrying passengers or goods coastwise in New Zealand, or as to carrying goods from any port in New Zealand to any port in any other Commonwealth country where a law similar to this section exists, as appear to him justly to countervail the disadvantages to which Commonwealth ships are subject as aforesaid.
    
    (2) On the arrival at any port in New Zealand of any ship of the country to which the Order relates, a copy of such Order, together with a copy of this section, shall be delivered by the Customs to the master.
    
    (3) If the master does any act in contravention of such Order the ship shall be forfeited, and shall be disposed of as directed by the Minister of Transport, and the proceeds of such forfeiture shall be paid into the Public Account and shall form part of the Consolidated Account.
    
    (4) In this section and in the next succeeding section _Commonwealth country_ and _Commonwealth ship_ have the respective meanings assigned thereto by the Shipping and Seamen Act 1952\.
    
    Compare: 1903 No 95 s 2
    
    In subsection (1) the words ""Commonwealth ships"" were substituted for the words ""British ships"" wherever they occur, the words ""binding on Her Majesty's Government of New Zealand"" were substituted for the words ""entered into by His Majesty"", and the words ""Commonwealth country"" were substituted for the words ""British possession"", by section 14 Shipping and Seamen Act 1952\.
    
    Subsection (2) was amended, as from 1 October 1996, by section [289(1)][305] Customs and Excise Act 1996 (1996 No 27) by substituting the word ""Customs"" for the words ""Collector of Customs"".
    
    In subsection (3) the reference to the Minister of Transport was substituted for a reference to the Minister of Marine by section 6(2)(a) Ministry of Transport Amendment Act 1972, and the reference to the Consolidated Account was substituted for a reference to the Consolidated Revenue Account (as substituted by section 4(4) Public Revenues Amendment Act 1963) by section 114(6) Public Finance Act 1977\. The terms Public Account and Consolidated Account were abolished by section [83(1)][306] Public Finance Act 1989 and should be read as references to the Crown Bank Account.
    
    Subsection (4) was inserted by section 514 Shipping and Seamen Act 1952\.

##### 205 Power of Governor-General to restrict privileges of foreign ships and impose additional duties
    
*   If it appears to the Governor-General---
        
    *   (a) That Commonwealth ships are subject in any foreign country, either directly or indirectly,---
            
        *   (i) To any prohibitions or restrictions as to the voyages in which they may engage, or as to the articles they may import into or export from such country; or
        
        *   (ii) To any duties or charges of any sort from which the national ships of such country are exempt; or
        
        
    
    *   (b) That any duties are imposed upon articles imported or exported in Commonwealth ships that are not equally imposed upon the like articles imported or exported in national ships; or
    
    *   (c) That any preference is shown, either directly or indirectly, to national ships over Commonwealth ships, or to articles imported or exported in national ships over the like articles imported or exported in Commonwealth ships; or
    
    *   (d) That British trade and navigation is not placed by such country upon as advantageous a footing as the trade and navigation of the most favoured nation,---
    
    he may in any such case, subject to the provisions of the Shipping and Seamen Act 1952, by Order in Council, impose such prohibitions or restrictions, or such duties of tonnage, upon the ships of that country entering into or departing from the ports of New Zealand, or such duties on all goods or on any specified classes of goods imported or exported in the ships of that country, as appear to him justly to countervail the disadvantages to which British trade or navigation is so subjected as aforesaid.
    
    Compare: 1882 No 55 s 180
    
    The words ""Commonwealth ships"" were substituted for the words ""British ships"" wherever they occur by section 514 Shipping and Seamen Act 1952\.
    
    The Shipping and Seamen Act 1952 has been substituted for the Merchant Shipping Act 1894 (UK), the provisions of which now have no effect as part of the law of New Zealand. The Shipping and Seamen Act 1952 was repealed, as from 1 February 1995, by section [104][307] Maritime Transport Act 1994\.
    
    As to the continuing effect of Orders in Council, rules, and regulations under the United Kingdom Merchant Shipping Act which, immediately before the commencement of Part 17 Shipping and Seamen Act 1952, had effect as part of the law of New Zealand, see the proviso to section 13(1) of that Act. _See_ also section 13(3) of that Act as to the application of the provisions of sections 20 and 21 Acts Interpretation Act 1924 with respect to the United Kingdom Merchant Shipping Act.

##### 206 Order in Council to specify ships to which it applies
    
*   In every such Order the Governor-General may specify what ships are to be considered as ships of the country to which such Order applies; and all ships answering the descriptions contained in such Order shall, for the purposes of such Order, be considered to be ships of such country.
