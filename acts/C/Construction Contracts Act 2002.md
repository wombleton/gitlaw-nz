    *   (a) has the right to refer a dispute to adjudication; and
    
    *   (b) may exercise that right even though the dispute is the subject of proceedings between the same parties in a court or tribunal.
    
    (2) An example of a dispute is a disagreement between the parties to a construction contract about whether or not an amount is payable under the contract (for example, a progress payment) or the reasons given for non-payment of that amount.

    (2) If a party to a construction contract submits a dispute to another dispute resolution procedure while the dispute is the subject of an adjudication, the submission to that other dispute resolution procedure does not---
        
    *   (a) bring to an end the adjudication proceedings; or
    
    *   (b) otherwise affect the adjudication.
    
    (3) However, an adjudicator must terminate the adjudication proceedings on a dispute if, before the adjudicator determines the dispute, that dispute is determined under another dispute resolution procedure.

##### 27 Effect of Part on civil proceedings

    *   (b) may make any orders that the court, tribunal, or member considers appropriate, having regard to any steps taken by a party to the contract in good faith and in reliance on an adjudicator's determination under this Part (including an order requiring a party to the contract to pay for goods and services supplied by another party to that contract in good faith and in reliance on an adjudicator's determination).

        *   (ii) is an associate of the owner.
        
        
    
    (2) If this section applies, the adjudicator must---

    *   (b) may be recovered by the owner as a debt due from the respondent.
    
    (3) If the owner has paid an amount determined by the adjudicator, the subsequent setting aside of the adjudicator's determination does not affect any rights conferred on the owner under this section.

    *   (b) refuse the application.
    
    (3) A District Court's determination under subsection (2)(a)---
        
    *   (a) has effect as if it were a determination made by an adjudicator for the purposes of this Act; and
    
    *   (b) is not a final determination of the dispute between the claimant and respondent to the adjudication under review.
    
    (4) Subsection (3)(b) does not prevent any proceedings between the claimant and respondent to the adjudication under review from being heard and determined at the same time as the application for review under this section.

##### 56 Costs of adjudication proceedings
    
*   (1) An adjudicator may determine that costs and expenses must be met by any of the parties to the adjudication (whether those parties are or are not, on the whole, successful in the adjudication) if the adjudicator considers that the party has caused those costs and expenses to be incurred unnecessarily by---

    *   (b) allegations or objections by that party that are without substantial merit.
    
    (2) If the adjudicator does not make a determination under subsection (1), the parties to the adjudication must meet their own costs and expenses.
    
    (3) An agreement about how the costs and expenses in adjudication proceedings are to be apportioned (including an agreement that a party is to indemnify another party in relation to those costs and expenses) is not binding on the parties to the adjudication if that agreement was made before the dispute arose.

    *   (b) a party to the adjudication acted in a contemptuous or improper manner during the adjudication.

    (7) If an adjudication claim is withdrawn or terminated, or the dispute between the parties is resolved, an adjudicator is entitled to be paid the fees and expenses incurred in the adjudication up to, and including, as the case may be, the date on which---

## Part 4  
Other measures for securing payment under this Act

### Subpart 1---Suspension of work

##### 72 Suspension of construction work
    
*   (1) A party who carries out construction work under a construction contract (_party A_) has the right to suspend work under that contract if---
        
    *   (a) any of the following circumstances applies:
            
        *   (i) a claimed amount is not paid in full by the due date for its payment and no payment schedule has been provided by the party who it is claimed is liable for the payment (_party B_):
        
        *   (ii) a scheduled amount is not paid in full by the due date for its payment even though a payment schedule given by party B indicates a scheduled amount that party B proposes to pay to party A:
        
        *   (iii) party B has not complied with an adjudicator's determination that party B must pay an amount to party A by a particular date; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) party A has served on party B a notice under [section 23(2)(b)][35] or [section 24(2)(b)][36] or [section 59(2)(b)][80], as the case may be; and
    
    *   (c) the amount mentioned in subsection (1)(a)(i) or subsection (1)(a)(ii) is not paid, or the determination mentioned in subsection (1)(a)(iii) is not complied with, within 5 working days after the date of that notice.
    
    (2) If party A exercises the right conferred by subsection (1), party A---
        
    *   (a) is not in breach of the construction contract; and
    
    *   (b) is not liable for any loss or damage suffered by party B, or by any person claiming through party B; and

    *   (d) keeps party A's rights under the contract, including any right to terminate the contract; and
    
    *   (e) may at any time lift the suspension, even if the amount has not been paid or the determination has not been complied with.
    
    (3) To avoid doubt, subsection (2)(c) does not affect party A's rights to recover (whether in an adjudication or otherwise) any costs incurred as a consequence of the extension of time that exist other than solely by reason of this Act, nor does it add anything to those rights.
    
    (4) If party A exercises the right conferred by subsection (1), the exercise of that right does not---
        
    *   (a) affect any rights that would otherwise have been available to party A under the [Contractual Remedies Act 1979][133]; or

#### Enforcement of adjudicator's determination involving charging order in respect of construction site

##### 76 Enforcement of adjudicator's determination involving charging order in respect of construction site
