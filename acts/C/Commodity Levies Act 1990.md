    *   (ab) that the support referendum was competently devised; and
    
    *   (ac) that the ballot paper described the proposal clearly, specifying in relation to it all the matters required by [section 6(1)][8] to be specified in a levy order, and (in particular) indicated that the imposition of the levy was proposed to be on the basis of one of the following:
            
        *   (i) production of the commodity:
        
        *   (ii) the value of the commodity produced:

    *   (ae) that the support referendum was so held that potential levy payers were given a reasonable opportunity to participate in it; and
    
    *   (af) that the voting in the support referendum was conducted on the basis of one of the matters specified in subparagraphs (i) to (iv) of paragraph (ac) (but not necessarily the matter that the ballot paper indicated was the proposed basis of the levy's imposition); and
    
    *   (ag) that more than half of the participants in the support referendum were supporters; and
    
    *   (ah) where voting in the support referendum was conducted on the basis of production of the commodity, that during the 12 months before the support referendum was held the total amount of the commodity produced by supporters was more than half of the total amount of the commodity produced of all participants; and
    
    *   (ai) where voting in the support referendum was conducted on the basis of the value of the commodity, that during the 12 months before the support referendum was held the value of the total amount of the commodity produced by supporters was more than half of the value of the total amount of the commodity produced of all participants; and
    
    *   (aj) where voting in the support referendum was conducted on the basis of the area of land devoted to the production of the commodity, that during the 12 months before the support referendum was held the total area of land devoted to the production of the commodity by supporters was more than half of the total area of land devoted to the production of the commodity by all participants; and

    *   (am) that the matters specified in the order pursuant to [section 6(1)][8] do not differ in any material way from those specified in the ballot paper pursuant to paragraph (ac); and

    *   (g) that---
            
        *   (i) persons opposing the levy's imposition on the commodity; and

        have had a reasonable opportunity to put their views to the Minister; and
    
    *   (h) that the Minister has had due regard to all views put to the Minister about the proposed imposition of the levy on the commodity; and
    
    *   (i) that the uses to which the levy will be put will be closely related to the interests of the persons who will be primarily responsible for paying it; and
    
    *   (j) that overall, the benefits to the persons who will be primarily responsible for paying the levy of the spending for the purposes specified in the order of the amount of levy likely to be raised will outweigh the disadvantages to them of the imposition, collection, and payment of the levy on the commodity; and
    
    *   (k) if the levy is imposed on quantities of the commodity imported into New Zealand that---
            
        *   (i) the importers will benefit from the spending of the levy; and
        
        *   (ii) the organisation will have regard to the importers' views on the spending of the levy; and
        
        *   (iii) the imposition of the levy on imported commodity will not be contrary to New Zealand's international legal obligations; and

        *   (ii) that if the doing of the things for which the levy is to be spent were paid for out of voluntary levies, persons who chose not to pay those levies would derive unearned benefits from the doing of those things; and
        
        
    
    *   (n) that the organisation has or will have in place adequate systems for accounting to persons who will be primarily responsible for paying the levy of its receipt and expenditure (including, in particular, the uses to which it will be put); and
    
    *   (o) that all other relevant matters known to the Minister have been properly considered.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Commodity Levies Act 1990\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 October 2012, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][53] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][54] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][55] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][56] and [17E][57] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
