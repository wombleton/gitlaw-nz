    (2) Without limiting the actions that the High Court may take under [Part 3][721] of the Summary Proceedings Act 1957 in relation to the fine or fines, the High Court may make any orders that it thinks fit, including a charging order or sale order in relation to the offender's real property.

    (5) Despite [section 90][727] of the Summary Proceedings Act 1957, the period of imprisonment that the High Court may impose on the offender for the non-payment of 1 or more fines must not exceed, for each fine, the lesser of---
        
    *   (a) the maximum term of imprisonment to which the offender was liable on the conviction; or
    
    *   (b) a period of 2 years.
    
    (6) If the High Court enforces 1 or more fines under this section, the court may, at the same time, enforce any outstanding fine or fines imposed on the offender by a District Court.
    
    (7) For the purposes of subsection (6), the outstanding fine or fines imposed by the District Court must be treated as if the fine or fines were imposed by the High Court and, in accordance with subsection (1), [Part 3][721] of the Summary Proceedings Act 1957 applies to the fine or fines, subject to---

    (11) To avoid doubt, [sections 92A to 92I][729] of the Summary Proceedings Act 1957 apply, subject to any necessary modifications, to any fine or fines imposed by the High Court, and accordingly, the chief executive of the Ministry of Justice may, among other things authorised by those sections, disclose information about default balances relating to such fine or fines in accordance with those sections.
    
    (12) For the purposes of this section, and subject to subsection (4), any reference in [Part 3][721] of the Summary Proceedings Act 1957 to---
