    (2) Without limiting the actions that the High Court may take under [Part 3][731] of the Summary Proceedings Act 1957 in relation to the fine or fines, the High Court may make any orders that it thinks fit, including a charging order or sale order in relation to the offender's real property.

    *   (a) the maximum term of imprisonment to which the offender was liable on the conviction; or
    
    *   (b) a period of 2 years.

    (10) The amount of the fee payable if default is made in the payment of 1 or more fines imposed by the High Court to which, under subsection (1), [Part 3][731] of the Summary Proceedings Act 1957 applies is the same as that prescribed by regulations, made under the [Summary Proceedings Act 1957][738], in respect of enforcement action taken under that Act to enforce the fine or fines.
    
    (11) To avoid doubt, [sections 92A to 92I][739] of the Summary Proceedings Act 1957 apply, subject to any necessary modifications, to any fine or fines imposed by the High Court, and accordingly, the chief executive of the Ministry of Justice may, among other things authorised by those sections, disclose information about default balances relating to such fine or fines in accordance with those sections.
    
    (12) For the purposes of this section, and subject to subsection (4), any reference in [Part 3][731] of the Summary Proceedings Act 1957 to---

#### Plea of guilty after committal for trial

##### 321 Person committed for trial may plead guilty before trial
    
*   (1) Where any person charged with any crime has been committed for trial, and, at any time before the commencement of the sittings to which he is committed for trial, desires to plead guilty to the crime, he shall sign a request in that behalf in [form 3][860] of Schedule 2\.
    
    (2) The request shall be sent to the Registrar of the court in the place to which the accused was committed for trial, and he shall as soon as practicable be brought before a Judge sitting in open court to be dealt with under this section.
    
    (3) If the accused is not in custody, notice shall be given to him of the time and place for attendance before the Judge.
    
    (4) On his attendance the accused shall be called upon to plead either guilty or not guilty to the crime for which he was committed for trial or, if the Judge so directs, to any other crime for which an indictment could have been filed against him following his committal for trial.
    
    (5) Before the accused is called upon to plead, the charge to which he is required to plead shall be read over to him.
    
    (6) If the accused then pleads guilty, the Judge shall have the same powers of sentencing or otherwise dealing with him, and of finally disposing of the charge to which the accused has pleaded guilty and of all incidental matters, as the Judge would have had if the accused on arraignment at any criminal sittings of the court had pleaded guilty to the charge on an indictment duly presented.
    
    (7) If the accused does not plead guilty as aforesaid, or if he does not attend in accordance with the notice given under subsection (3), or if it is not practicable for him to be dealt with by a Judge under this section before the commencement of the sittings to which he was committed for trial, he shall be treated in all respects as if he had not made any request to plead guilty in accordance with this section, and no comment shall be made at his trial for the crime charged on the fact that such a request has been made, nor shall the request be admissible in evidence against him.
    
    (8) Any bail bond entered into by any person in respect of the crime for which the accused was committed for trial shall cease to have effect when the accused, after pleading guilty, has been sentenced or otherwise dealt with under this section.

    (2) The accused may at any stage of the trial apply to the court to amend or divide any such count on the ground that it is so framed as to embarrass him in his defence.
    
    (3) The court, if satisfied that the ends of justice require it, may order any count to be amended, or divided into 2 or more counts; and on the order being made that count shall be so divided or amended, and thereupon a formal commencement may be inserted before each of the counts into which it is divided.

##### 332 Indictment for perjury or fraud
    
*   (1) No count charging perjury, the making of a false oath or of a false statement, or the fabrication of evidence, or procuring the commission of any of those crimes, shall be deemed insufficient on the ground that it does not state the nature or the authority of the tribunal before which the oath or statement was taken or made, or the subject of the inquiry, or the words used, or the evidence fabricated, or that it does not expressly negative the truth of the words used; but the court may order that the prosecutor shall furnish further particulars in writing of what is relied on in support of the charge.
    
    (2) No count charging any false pretence, or any fraud, or any attempt or conspiracy by fraudulent means, shall be deemed insufficient because it does not set out in detail in what the false pretence, or the fraud, or the fraudulent means consisted; but the court may order that the prosecutor shall furnish further particulars in writing of those matters, or any of them.
    
    Compare: 1908 No 32 s 390(1), (2)

    (3) In determining whether further particulars are required or not, and whether a defect in the indictment is material to the substantial justice of the case or not, the court may have regard to the depositions.
    
    Compare: 1908 No 32 s 391

##### 335 Variance and amendment
    
*   (1) If on the trial of an indictment there appears to be a variance between the proof and the charge in any count of the indictment either as filed or as amended, or as it would have been if amended in conformity with any such further particulars, the court before which the case is tried, or the Court of Appeal, may amend the indictment, or any count in it, so as to make it conformable with the proof.
    
    (2) If the court is of opinion that the accused has not been misled or prejudiced in his defence by such variance it shall make the amendment.
    
    (3) If it appears that the indictment has been filed under some other enactment instead of under this Act, or under this Act instead of under some other enactment, or that there is in the indictment or in any count in it an omission to state or a defective statement of anything requisite to constitute the crime, or an omission to negative any exception that ought to be negatived, but that the matter omitted is proved by the evidence, the court before which the trial takes place, or the Court of Appeal, if of opinion that the accused has not been misled or prejudiced in his defence by the error or omission, shall amend the indictment or count as may be necessary.
    
    (4) In any such case the trial or the appeal may then proceed in all respects as if the indictment or count had been originally framed as amended.
    
    (5) If the court is of opinion that the accused has been misled or prejudiced in his defence by any such variance, error, omission, or defective statement as aforesaid, but that the effect of his being misled or prejudiced might be removed by adjourning or postponing the trial, the court may in its discretion make the amendment and adjourn the trial to a future day in the same sittings, or discharge the jury and postpone the trial to the next sittings of the court, on such terms as it thinks just.
    
    (6) Where an amendment of any indictment or count is made under this section by the Court of Appeal, that court may in its discretion, in making the amendment, either affirm the sentence or direct a new trial.
    
    (7) In determining whether the accused has been misled or prejudiced in his defence, the court that has to determine the question shall consider the contents of the depositions, as well as the other circumstances of the case.
    
    (8) The propriety of making or refusing to make any such amendment shall be deemed a question for the court, and the decision of the court upon it may be reserved for the Court of Appeal, or may be brought on appeal before the Court of Appeal, in the same manner as any other decision on a point of law.

##### 386 Powers of appellate courts in special cases
    
*   (1) If on any appeal under [section 383][623] it appears to the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court that an appellant, though not properly convicted on some count or part of the indictment, has been properly convicted on some other count or part of the indictment, the court may either affirm the sentence passed on the appellant or pass such sentence in substitution therefor as it thinks proper and as may be warranted in law by the verdict on the count or part of the indictment on which the court considers that the appellant has been properly convicted.
    
    (2) Where an appellant has been convicted of an offence and the jury could on the indictment have found him guilty of some other offence, and on the finding of the jury it appears to the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court that the jury must have been satisfied of facts which proved him guilty of that other offence, the court may, instead of allowing or dismissing the appeal, substitute for the verdict found by the jury a verdict of guilty of that other offence, and pass such sentence in substitution for the sentence passed as may be warranted in law for that other offence, not being a sentence of greater severity.
    
    (3) Where on the conviction of the appellant the jury has found a special verdict, and the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court considers that a wrong conclusion has been arrived at by the court before which the appellant has been convicted on the effect of that verdict, the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court may, instead of allowing the appeal, order such conclusion to be recorded as appears to the court to be in law required by the verdict, and pass such sentence in substitution for the sentence passed as may be warranted in law.
    
    (4) If on any such appeal it appears to the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court that the appellant was insane at the time of the commission of the offence and should have been acquitted on account of his insanity, the court may quash the conviction; and thereupon [sections 23 to 26][805], [28][921], and [33][806] of the Criminal Procedure (Mentally Impaired Persons) Act 2003 shall apply, so far as they are applicable, as if he had been so acquitted and as if references in any of those sections to the court were references to the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court (as the case requires).

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Crimes Act 1961\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 October 2012, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][973] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][974] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][975] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][976] and [17E][977] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
