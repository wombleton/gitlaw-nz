(If the civil union is to be solemnised by a Registrar, [section 14][19] applies.)
    
    (2) Despite subsection (1), a Registrar must not issue a licence and information return forms if---

        *   (i) before the third day after notice of the intended civil union has been given under [section 11][16], unless the Registrar is satisfied that the parties to the intended civil union would be inconvenienced by the delay; or
        
        *   (ii) more than 3 months after the date on which notice of the intended civil union was given (or, where a notice of objection has been lodged, more than 3 months after the date on which the notice of objection was withdrawn or discharged).
        
        
    
    (2) During the solemnisation, in the presence of the Registrar and at least 2 witnesses, each party must make a clear statement to the other that---

    (2) During the solemnisation, in the presence of the civil union celebrant and at least 2 witnesses, each party must make a clear statement to the other that---
        
    *   (a) names both parties; and
    
    *   (b) acknowledges that they are freely joining in a civil union with each other.
    
    (3) The celebrant must, under [section 62B][84] of the Births, Deaths, Marriages, and Relationships Registration Act 1995, take all reasonable steps to ensure that the civil union is registered under that Act.

    Section 15(3): amended, on 24 January 2009, by [section 47][73] of the Births, Deaths, Marriages, and Relationships Registration Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No 48).

##### 16 Solemnisation by exempt body
    
*   (1) A civil union may be solemnised by an exempt body if it is solemnised in accordance with the rules and procedures of the body as most recently notified to the Registrar-General in accordance with [Schedule 1][64].
    
    (2) When a civil union is solemnised by an exempt body, the obligations imposed on civil union celebrants by [section 62B][84] of the Births, Deaths, Marriages, and Relationships Registration Act 1995 must be performed by the person or office holder, or in the manner, as set out in the rules and procedures of the exempt body that have been most recently notified to the Registrar-General in accordance with [Schedule 1][64].
    
    Compare: 1955 No 92 [ss 31(4), (5)][85], [32][86], [32A][87]
    
    Section 16(2): amended, on 24 January 2009, by [section 47][73] of the Births, Deaths, Marriages, and Relationships Registration Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No 48).

#### Changing form of relationship

##### 17 Purpose of section 18
    
*   The purpose of [section 18][24] is to allow couples who are married or in a civil union with each other, and who wish to continue in a relationship with each other, to change the form of that relationship by having the new form of relationship solemnised without having to formally dissolve the first relationship (which normally involves living apart for 2 years).

##### 18 Changing form of relationship
    
*   (1) A married couple may enter into a civil union with each other; and 2 people in a civil union with each other, and who are otherwise eligible to marry, may marry each other.
    
    (2) Before changing the form of their relationship under this section, the party who gives the notice required by [section 11][16] of this Act or [section 23][78] of the Marriage Act 1955 must state on the form that the parties are already in a civil union with each other or are married to each other (as the case requires) and that they wish to change the form of their relationship.
    
    (3) The solemnisation of the marriage of 2 people who are in a civil union with each other changes the relationship from a civil union into a marriage; but in any situation in which the duration of the resulting marriage is in issue, the duration of the earlier civil union is to be treated as part of the duration of the marriage.
    
    (4) The solemnisation of a civil union between 2 people who are married to each other changes the relationship from a marriage into a civil union; but in any situation in which the duration of the resulting civil union is in issue, the duration of the earlier marriage is to be treated as part of the duration of the civil union.

#### Consent for persons aged 16 or 17

##### 19 Consent to civil union of persons aged 16 or 17
    
*   (1) A Registrar may not issue a licence in respect of a civil union, or solemnise a civil union, in which one of the parties is aged 16 or 17 unless the Registrar is satisfied that the consents required by this section have been obtained.
    
    (2) A person aged 16 or 17 who wishes to enter into a civil union must obtain the consent of each of his or her guardians to the proposed civil union.
    
    (3) However, the consent of a particular guardian is not required if the guardian cannot be found or is unable to give consent as a result of incapacity.
    
    (4) If, because of subsection (3), there is no guardian from whom consent can be sought, consent must be obtained either from a relative who has been acting in the place of a guardian or from a Family Court Judge.
    
    (5) Every consent under this section must---
        
    *   (a) be in writing; and
    
    *   (b) except in the case of a consent issued by a Family Court Judge, be witnessed by some person who must sign the consent and give his or her full name and address; and
    
    *   (c) be delivered to the Registrar to whom notice of the intended civil union is given.
    
    (6) A consent may be withdrawn, in writing, at any time before the Registrar issues the licence or solemnises the civil union, as the case requires.
    
    Compare: 1955 No 92 [ss 18][88], [20][89]

##### 20 Application to Family Court Judge if consent refused
    
*   (1) If a person whose consent to a civil union is required under [section 19][26] refuses to give that consent, a Family Court Judge may, on application, consent to the civil union, and that consent has the same effect as if it had been given by the person who refused to give consent.
    
    (2) When an application is made to a Family Court Judge for consent to a civil union, notice of the application must be served on every person whose consent to the civil union is required under [section 19][26].
    
    (3) Despite subsection (2), a Family Court Judge may, at his or her discretion, dispense with serving notice on a person whose consent to a civil union is required under [section 19][26].
    
    Compare: 1955 No 92 [s 19][90]

#### Notice of objection to civil union

##### 21 Notice of objection to proposed civil union
    
*   (1) A person may lodge with any Registrar a notice of objection to the civil union of any person named in the notice on the grounds that the civil union is one for which a licence should not be issued.
    
    (2) Every notice of objection must be in writing signed by or on behalf of the person who lodged the notice of objection, and must state the person's full name, residential address, and the particulars of the grounds of objection on which the notice of objection is founded.
    
    (3) A copy of a notice of objection may be given to any Registrar other than the Registrar with whom it was lodged, in which case the copy must also show the date and place of lodgement of the notice of objection.
    
    (4) A notice of objection lapses 1 year from the date on which it was lodged unless, within that time, a notice has been given under [section 11][16] of the intended civil union of the person to whom the notice of objection relates.
    
    (5) A notice of objection lodged under this section is for all purposes to be treated as also being a caveat lodged under [section 25][91] of the Marriage Act 1955; and a caveat lodged under section 25 of the Marriage Act 1955 is for all purposes to be treated as also being a notice of objection lodged under this section.
    
    Compare: 1955 No 92 [ss 25][91], [26(2)][92]

##### 22 Judge to deal with notice of objection
    
*   (1) If a Registrar receives notice under [section 11][16] of an intended civil union and the Registrar is aware that a notice of objection has been lodged with respect to either party to the intended civil union, the Registrar must immediately submit the notice of objection to a Family Court Judge or, if a Family Court Judge is not available, to a District Court Judge.
    
    (2) The Judge to whom the notice of objection is submitted must immediately inquire into the grounds of objection stated in the notice of objection, and, if the Judge is of the opinion that those grounds should not prevent the solemnisation of the civil union, he or she must discharge the notice of objection.
    
    (3) If a Judge refuses to discharge a notice of objection under this section, any person may make an application to a Family Court Judge for the discharge of the notice of objection, and the Family Court Judge, if he or she is of the opinion that there is no longer any reason why the intended civil union should not be solemnised, must discharge the notice of objection.
    
    (4) A person who lodges a notice of objection is liable for damages if the court considers that the grounds on which the notice of objection was lodged were vexatious and unreasonable.
    
    Compare: 1955 No 92 [ss 26][92], [27][93]

#### When civil union is or may be declared void

##### 23 When civil union is or may be declared void
    
*   (1) The grounds on which a civil union is void _ab initio_ are set out in [section 31][94] of the Family Proceedings Act 1980\.
    
    (2) A civil union may also be declared to be void _ab initio_ on the grounds that, at the time the civil union was solemnised,---
        
    *   (a) one of the parties to it was under the age of 16; or
    
    *   (b) one of the parties to it was aged 16 or 17 and the consents required under [section 19][26] had not be given.
    
    (3) An application for a declaration under subsection (2) may be made under [section 29][95] of the Family Proceedings Act 1980 as if the application were an application for an order declaring that the civil union was void _ab initio_ on any of the grounds referred to in [section 31][94] of that Act.
    
    Compare: 1955 No 92 [ss 15(4)][77], [17(2)][76], [18(7)][88]

##### 24 Effect of defects in formalities or procedures
    
*   (1) A defect in compliance with the formalities or procedures required under this Act does not, in itself, render a civil union void.
    
    (2) However, nothing in this section exempts a Registrar or civil union celebrant who, or an exempt body that, does anything contrary to the provisions of this Act from any penalty for an offence under this Act.
    
    Compare: 1955 No 92 [s 22][96]

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Civil Union Act 2004\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 24 January 2009, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that have yet to come into force or that contain relevant transitional or savings provisions are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order.

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][118] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/legislation/reprints.shtml or Part 8 of the _Tables of Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations, and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][119] and [17E][120] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
