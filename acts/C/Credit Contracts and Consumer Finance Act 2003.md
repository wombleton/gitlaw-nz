    (3) Subsections (1) and (2) do not permit a debit or credit to be assigned a date other than the date on which it is processed, or the subsequent adjustment of a debit or credit or account balance, if---

    (3) If, because of any contract or contracts (none of which by itself constitutes a consumer lease) or any arrangement, there is a transaction that is in substance or effect a consumer lease, the contract, contracts, or arrangement must, for the purposes of this Act, be treated as a consumer lease made at the time when the contract, or the last of those contracts, or the arrangement, was made, as the case may be.

*   (1) A lease is not a consumer lease if the lessee makes a declaration before entering into the lease that the goods are hired primarily for business purposes.
    
    (2) Subsection (1) does not apply if the lessor, or the person who obtains the declaration, knew, or had reason to believe, at the time the declaration was made that the goods were in fact hired primarily for personal, domestic, or household purposes.
    
    (3) A declaration is effective only if the declaration is in a separate written document and the lessee confirms that he or she has read and understood the declaration.
