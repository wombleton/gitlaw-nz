    (4) The Minister shall not grant any application for a concession to build a structure or facility, or to extend or add to an existing structure or facility, where he or she is satisfied that the activity---
        
    *   (a) could reasonably be undertaken in another location that---
            
        *   (i) is outside the conservation area to which the application relates; or
        
        *   (ii) is in another conservation area or in another part of the conservation area to which the application relates, where the potential adverse effects would be significantly less; or

    *   (b) in any case where the application includes an area or areas around the structure or facility,---
            
        *   (i) either---

##### 17V Limitations on concessions and leases over marginal strips
    
*   (1) Without limiting the power of the Minister to grant a concession over a conservation area that is a marginal strip, the Minister may decline to grant a concession in any case if he or she is satisfied that it is more appropriate in that case to enter into any agreement or arrangement under [section 24H][113].
    
    (2) No concession may authorise the owner of any land adjoining a marginal strip to use the marginal strip for farming purposes or forestry purposes or any purpose associated with or incidental to any farming or forestry carried out on the adjoining land; but nothing in the preceding provisions of this subsection limits or affects [section 24H][113].
    
    (3) The Minister shall not grant a lease (other than a lease that formalises an occupation of the land, where that occupation existed before 10 April 1990) over a marginal strip unless he or she is satisfied that---
        
    *   (a) the grant is permitted by this Part; and
    
    *   (b) the activities authorised by the lease require the use of both the marginal strip and the adjacent water; and

    (2) Where---
        
    *   (a) there is no conservation management strategy or conservation management plan for a conservation area; or
    
    *   (b) the relevant conservation management strategy or conservation management plan does not make any provision for the activity to which the application relates in a conservation area,---
    
    the Minister, after complying with the provisions of [sections 17S][71], [17T][72], and [17U][73], may grant a concession.
    
    (3) The Minister may decline any application, whether or not it is in accordance with any relevant conservation management strategy or conservation management plan, if he or she considers that the effects of the activity are such that a review of the strategy or plan, or the preparation of a strategy or plan, is more appropriate.
    
    (4) On declining an application under subsection (3), the Minister, if requested by the applicant to do so and after consultation with the relevant Conservation Board, may initiate a review of the strategy or plan pursuant to [section 17H][59] or the preparation of a strategy or plan under this Act.

    (8) Any provision of a concession document that contravenes or allows expressly or by implication any action or default on the part of the concessionaire in contravention of the strategy or plan shall have no effect and any breach or contravention of the strategy or plan shall be deemed to be a breach or contravention of the concession and concession document.
