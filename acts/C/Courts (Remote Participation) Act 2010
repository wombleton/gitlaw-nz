##### 10 Judicial officer or Registrar may vary or revoke determination

    (2) A Registrar may at any time vary or revoke his or her determination, or the determination of another Registrar, to allow the use of AVL for the appearance of a participant if the Registrar considers that any reason for the determination, with respect to the criteria in [section 5][6], or [sections 5][6] and [6][7], as the case may be, no longer applies.

##### 11 Judicial officer or Registrar may make direction
