Guarantees in respect of supply of goods

##### 5 Guarantees as to title
    
*   (1) Subject to [section 41][62], the following guarantees apply where goods are supplied to a consumer:
        
    *   (a) that the supplier has a right to sell the goods; and
    
    *   (b) that the goods are free from any undisclosed security; and
    
    *   (c) that the consumer has the right to undisturbed possession of the goods, except in so far as that right is varied pursuant to---
            
        *   (i) a term of the agreement for supply in any case where that agreement is a hire purchase agreement within the meaning of the [Income Tax Act 2007][99]; or
        
        *   (ii) a security, or a term of the agreement for supply, in respect of which the consumer has received---
                
            *   (A) oral advice, acknowledged in writing by the consumer, as to the way in which the consumer's right to undisturbed possession of the goods could be affected, sufficient to enable a reasonable consumer to understand the general nature and effect of the variation; and
            
            *   (B) a written copy of the agreement for supply or security, or a written copy of the part thereof which provides for the variation.
            
            
        
        
    
    (2) A reference in subsection (1)(a) to a _right to sell _goods means a right to dispose of the ownership of the goods to the consumer at the time when that ownership is to pass.
    
    (3) An _undisclosed security_ referred to in this section means any security that was neither disclosed to the consumer in writing before he or she agreed to the supply nor created by or with the express consent of the consumer.
    
    (4) Nothing in subsection (1)(a) or (1)(b) shall apply in any case where the goods are only hired or leased.
    
    (5) Where the goods are only hired or leased, the guarantee set out in subsection (1)(c) shall confer a right to undisturbed possession of the goods only for the period of the hire or lease.
    
    (6) [Part 2][23] gives the consumer a right of redress against the supplier where the goods fail to comply with any guarantee in this section.
    
    Compare: 1908 No 168 [s 14][100]; 1971 No 147 s 11
    
    Section 5(1)(c)(i): amended, on 1 April 2008 (effective for 2008--09 income year and later income years, except when the context requires otherwise), by [section ZA 2(1)][101] of the Income Tax Act 2007 (2007 No 97).

##### 5A Guarantee as to delivery
    
*   (1) Where a supplier is responsible for delivering, or for arranging for the delivery of, goods to a consumer there is a guarantee that the goods will be received by the consumer---
        
    *   (a) at a time, or within a period, agreed between the supplier and the consumer; or
    
    *   (b) if no time or period has been agreed, within a reasonable time.
    
    (2) Where the delivery of the goods fails to comply with the guarantee under this section, [Part 2][23] gives the consumer a right of redress against the supplier and, in that case, the consumer may,---
        
    *   (a) if the failure is of a substantial character, reject the goods under [section 18(3)][28]; and
    
    *   (b) in any case, obtain damages under [section 18(4)][28] (other than damages relating to the remedies set out in section 18(2)), whether or not the consumer also rejects the goods.
    
    (3) For the purposes of this section, the reference in [section 20(1)(b)][31] to an agent of the supplier must be treated as including any carrier or other person who undertakes to deliver the goods on behalf of the supplier.
    
    (4) A consumer's rights of redress under [Part 2][23] in relation to the guarantee under this section are limited to those specified in subsection (2).

    (3) Where goods are displayed for sale or hire, the defects that are to be treated as having been specifically drawn to the consumer's attention for the purposes of subsection (2) are those disclosed on a written notice displayed with the goods.

    *   (a) that the supply of gas or electricity may be affected by emergencies, or other events or circumstances, outside the control of the retailer or any other person involved in the supply of gas or electricity; and

    *   (b) if, in a case where the quality and reliability of supply by a gas or electricity retailer to a particular consumer is likely to be significantly worse than the quality and reliability of supply that generally applies to gas or electricity supplied by the retailer,---
            
        *   (i) the retailer or the person supplying line function services has specifically explained to the consumer the ways in which the supply is likely to be significantly worse; and

    *   (b) the failure of acceptable quality was wholly or partly the result of an event, circumstance, or condition associated with---
            
        *   (i) a gas pipeline or other equipment that was, at the time of the failure, the responsibility of a person then supplying line function services (a _responsible party_); or

    *   (b) if the retailer incurs remedy costs in relation to that consumer for a failure of acceptable quality that arose from the same event, circumstance, or condition that led to the payment of payment A; then
    
    *   (c) the amount that the retailer would otherwise recover from the responsible party in respect of that consumer must be reduced by the amount of payment A.
    
    (5) Disputes between gas or electricity retailers and responsible parties relating to the existence or allocation of liability under the indemnity may be dealt with by the dispute resolution scheme referred to,---
        
    *   (a) in the case of gas, in [section 43E][125] of the Gas Act 1992; and
    
    *   (b) in the case of electricity, in [section 95][124] of the Electricity Industry Act 2010\.
