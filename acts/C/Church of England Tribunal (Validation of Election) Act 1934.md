*   #### Preamble
    
    WHEREAS by The [Church of England Empowering Act 1928][5] (hereinafter in this recital referred to as the said Act), the powers of the General Synod of the Church of the Province of New Zealand, commonly called the Church of England, in relation to the Formularies of that Church and to certain other matters are defined: And whereas by the said Act provision is made for the election of a representative Tribunal to hear and determine appeals from proposals adopted by the General Synod in relation to the exercise of the powers hereinbefore referred to: And whereas by subsection [two][6] of section five of the said Act it was provided that the first election of the aforesaid tribunal should take place at the first session of the General Synod after the passing of the said Act: And whereas such first session was held at Christchurch in the month of February, nineteen hundred and thirty-one, in which month occurred the series of earthquakes referred to in The [Hawke's Bay Earthquake Act 1931][7]: And whereas the proceedings of the General Synod at the said session were to some extent disorganized by reason of the said earthquakes, and the first election of the Tribunal hereinbefore referred to was not held in accordance with the said Act, but was held at the session of the General Synod which took place at Napier in the month of April, nineteen hundred and thirty-four: And whereas it is desirable that the validity of the election held in the month of April, nineteen hundred and thirty-four, should not be questioned on the ground that the provisions of the said Act as to the first election have not been complied with:

BE IT THEREFORE ENACTED by the General Assembly of New Zealand in Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:---

##### 1 Short Title

*   The session of the General Synod of the Church of the Province of New Zealand, held at Napier, in the month of April, nineteen hundred and thirty-four, shall for all the purposes of The [Church of England Empowering Act 1928][5], and the election of a Tribunal for the purposes of that Act, be deemed to have been the first session of the General Synod held after the passing of the said Act, and the Tribunal elected at that session shall accordingly be deemed to have been as validly elected as if it had been elected at the first session which was in fact held after the passing of the said Act.
