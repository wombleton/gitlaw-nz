##### 1 Title
    
*   This Act is the Coroners Act 2006\.

##### 2 Commencement
    
*   (1) [Sections 1 to 3][1], [141][159], and [142][160], and [Schedules 1][165] and [2][166] come into force on the day after the date on which this Act receives the Royal assent.
    
    (2) The rest of this Act comes into force on 1 July 2007\.

## Part 1  
General provisions

##### 3 Purpose of this Act
    
*   (1) The purpose of this Act is to help to prevent deaths and to promote justice through---
        
    *   (a) investigations, and the identification of the causes and circumstances, of sudden or unexplained deaths, or deaths in special circumstances; and
    
    *   (b) the making of specified recommendations or comments (as defined in [section 9][10]) that, if drawn to public attention, may reduce the chances of the occurrence of other deaths in circumstances similar to those in which those deaths occurred.
    
    (2) To help to achieve its purpose, this Act---
        
    *   (a) identifies deaths that must be reported to a coroner and the process for reporting and investigating those deaths:
    
    *   (b) recognises both---
            
        *   (i) the cultural and spiritual needs of family of, and of others who were in a close relationship to, a person who has died; and
        
        *   (ii) the public good associated with a proper and timely understanding of the causes and circumstances of deaths:
        
        
    
    *   (c) provides for an independent coronial system for investigations of deaths by coroners liaising with other authorities permitted or required by law to investigate those deaths:
    
    *   (d) repeals and replaces the [Coroners Act 1988][170].
    
    

##### 4 Coroner's role
    
*   (1) A coroner's role in relation to a death is---
        
    *   (a) to receive a report of the death from the New Zealand Police; and
    
    *   (b) to decide whether to direct a post-mortem and, if one is directed, to determine whether to authorise certain people (other than the pathologist) to attend; and
    
    *   (c) to authorise the release of the body (including determining, if a post-mortem has been directed, whether the pathologist wishes and is permitted, on the release of the body, to retain body parts or bodily samples); and
    
    *   (d) to decide whether to open an inquiry (and, if one is to be conducted, whether an inquest should be held); and
    
    *   (e) if an inquiry is to be opened and conducted,---
            
        *   (i) to open and conduct it for the 3 purposes stated in subsection (2) (and in [section 57][66]), and not to determine civil, criminal, or disciplinary liability; and
        
        *   (ii) to determine related matters such as whether to prohibit the making public of evidence and whether to authorise the making public of certain particulars of deaths suspected or found to be self-inflicted deaths; and
        
        *   (iii) on completing it, to complete and sign a certificate of findings in relation to the death; and
        
        
    
    *   (f) to give members and representatives of the immediate family of the person who is, or of a person who is suspected to be, the dead person concerned, and certain others, notice of significant matters in the carrying out of the duties and processes required by law to be performed or followed in relation to the death.
    
    (2) The 3 purposes referred to in subsection (1)(e)(i) are---
        
    *   (a) to establish, so far as possible,---
            
        *   (i) that a person has died; and
        
        *   (ii) the person's identity; and
        
        *   (iii) when and where the person died; and
        
        *   (iv) the causes of the death; and
        
        *   (v) the circumstances of the death; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) to make specified recommendations or comments (as defined in [section 9][10]) that, in the coroner's opinion, may, if drawn to public attention, reduce the chances of the occurrence of other deaths in circumstances similar to those in which the death occurred; and
    
    *   (c) to determine whether the public interest would be served by the death being investigated by other investigating authorities in the performance or exercise of their functions, powers, or duties, and to refer the death to them if satisfied that the public interest would be served by their investigating it in the performance or exercise of their functions, powers, or duties.
    
    (3) This section is only a general guide to a coroner's role.

##### 5 Coroners must perform their duties without delay
    
*   Every coroner must, so far as it is consistent with justice and practicable to do so, perform or exercise his or her functions, powers, and duties without delay.

##### 6 Coroners must have regard to relevant practice notes
    
*   In performing or exercising a function, power, or duty, a coroner must have regard to any practice note issued by the chief coroner under [section 132][148] that is relevant to the performance or exercise of the function, power, or duty.

##### 7 Chief coroner's functions
    
*   The chief coroner's main function is to help to ensure the integrity and effectiveness of the coronial system provided for by this Act, and, in order to carry out his or her main function, the chief coroner has the following additional functions:
        
    *   (a) to help to ensure coroners' investigations are conducted in an orderly and expeditious way by overseeing them, and by facilitating the provision and co-ordination of support services and of necessary or desirable cultural, legal, medical, or other specialist advice:
    
    *   (b) to advise the responsible department on, and help it to make arrangements to meet, coroners' needs for information and for initial and continuing professional education and training:
    
    *   (c) to designate coroners (and replacement designated coroners) to receive reports of, and perform every other part of the coroner's role in relation to, deaths in a particular area or that fall into another specified class:
    
    *   (d) to maintain a list of names of pathologists who are willing to perform post-mortems:
    
    *   (e) to designate other coroners to conduct inquiries where there is some good reason why the coroners to whom the deaths have been reported should not conduct them:
    
    *   (f) to authorise coroners to open and conduct inquiries or further inquiries required by orders under [sections 95 to 97][107], and to serve those orders on those coroners:
    
    *   (g) to advise the Minister on the numbers and locations of relief coroners, and to authorise them to act in the place of, or help, coroners:
    
    *   (h) to help to inform and achieve consistency in coronial decision-making and other coronial conduct by issuing practice notes:
    
    *   (i) to set up and maintain a register, open for public inspection at all reasonable times, of summaries of coroners' specified recommendations or comments (as defined in [section 9][10]):
    
    *   (j) to perform the functions of a Head of Bench under the [Judicial Conduct Commissioner and Judicial Conduct Panel Act 2004][171] in relation to the exercise by coroners (except for those who are District Court Judges) of the judicial authority conferred on them by this Act:
    
    *   (k) to provide coroners and others with general information and advice to help planning and preparation for---
            
        *   (i) an emergency (as defined in the [Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002][172]); and
        
        *   (ii) response and recovery in the event of an emergency (as so defined):
        
        
    
    *   (l) to help to avoid unnecessary duplication and expedite investigation of deaths by liaison, and encouragement of co-ordination (for example, through development of protocols), with other investigating authorities and other official bodies or statutory officers:
    
    *   (m) to help, by education, publicity, and liaison with the public, to promote understanding of, and co-operation with, the coronial system provided for by this Act:
    
    *   (n) any other additional function conferred or imposed by any other enactment.

##### 31 Coroner may direct post-mortem
    
*   (1) A coroner may direct a pathologist to perform a post-mortem of a body---
        
    *   (a) for the purpose of enabling the coroner to decide whether to open an inquiry into the death concerned; or
    
    *   (b) if the coroner is to open, or has opened and not completed, an inquiry into the death concerned.
    
    (2) If a coroner proposes to direct a post-mortem under this section, [section 33][39] (right in some cases to object to post-mortem) may apply to that post-mortem and [section 34(1)(d)][40] (procedure for objections under section 33) may prohibit the coroner from directing that the post-mortem be performed.
    
    (3) The pathologist must be a listed pathologist.
    
    (4) The pathologist must not be a doctor who, to the coroner's knowledge, was a doctor who attended the person concerned immediately before death.
    
    (5) If, in accordance with [section 37][43], the coroner so directs, the pathologist must perform the post-mortem immediately.
    
    (6) As soon as practicable after completing the post-mortem, the pathologist must give the coroner a written report on the results of the post-mortem.
    
    Compare: 1988 No 111 [s 7][236]

##### 32 Criteria for decision whether to direct post-mortem
    
*   In deciding whether to direct a post-mortem under [section 31][37], a coroner must have regard to the following matters:
        
    *   (a) the extent to which the matters required by this Act to be established by an inquiry---
            
        *   (i) are not already disclosed in respect of the death concerned by information available directly to the coroner or from information arising from investigations or examinations the coroner has made or caused to be made; but
        
        *   (ii) are likely to be disclosed by a post-mortem; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) whether the Director-General of Health has ordered or is likely to order a post-mortem of the body concerned under [section 78][237] of the Health Act 1956; and
    
    *   (c) whether the death appears to have been unnatural or violent; and
    
    *   (d) if the death appears to have been unnatural or violent, whether it appears to have been due to the actions or inaction of other people; and
    
    *   (e) the existence and extent of any allegations, rumours, suspicions, or public concern about the cause of the death; and
    
    *   (f) the desirability of minimising the causing of distress to people who, by reason of their ethnic origins, social attitudes or customs, or spiritual beliefs, customarily require bodies to be available to family members as soon as possible after death; and
    
    *   (g) the desirability of minimising the causing of offence to people who, by reason of their ethnic origins, social attitudes or customs, or spiritual beliefs, find post-mortems of bodies offensive; and
    
    *   (h) the desire of any member of the immediate family of the person concerned that a post-mortem should be performed; and
    
    *   (i) any other matters the coroner thinks relevant.
    
    Compare: 1988 No 111 [s 8][238]

##### 33 Right in some cases to object to post-mortem
    
*   (1) This section applies to a post-mortem of a body that a coroner proposes to direct under [section 31][37] be performed unless the coroner proposes to direct that the post-mortem be performed immediately (in accordance with [section 37][43]) because (together with any other good reason) any delay would or may limit the pathologist's ability to determine the cause of death.
    
    (2) Every member of the immediate family of the person who is, or of a person who is suspected to be, the dead person concerned has, in the situation specified in subsection (3), a right to object to the post-mortem.
    
    (3) The situation referred to in subsection (2) is that the coroner is, after having made all reasonable investigations, satisfied that, in the particular circumstances,---
        
    *   (a) the death concerned does not appear to have been, and is unlikely to appear later to have been, a result of conduct that constitutes a criminal offence; and
    
    *   (b) New Zealand's international legal obligations, and the laws of New Zealand, do not appear to require the post-mortem to be performed.
    
    

##### 34 Procedure for objections under section 33
    
*   (1) If a coroner determines that members of the immediate family have, under [section 33][39], a right to object to the post-mortem,---
        
    *   (a) notice of that right must be given in accordance with [section 23][28]; and
    
    *   (b) any exercise of that right must be as soon as practicable and within 24 hours of the coroner's determination; and
    
    *   (c) that right is exercised by advising the coroner of the fact of and reasons for the objection to the post-mortem; and
    
    *   (d) the coroner cannot, if that right is exercised within that 24-hour period, direct under [section 31][37] that the post-mortem be performed unless permitted to do so by subsection (3) of this section or by order of the High Court under [section 35(6)][41].
    
    (2) If, 24 hours after the coroner determines that members of the immediate family have, under [section 33][39], a right to object to the post-mortem, the coroner has received objections under section 33, he or she must as soon as practicable---
        
    *   (a) decide whether he or she still wishes to direct under [section 31][37] that the post-mortem be performed; and
    
    *   (b) advise the objectors accordingly.
    
    (3) The coroner may direct under [section 31][37] that the post-mortem be performed if, 48 hours after the objectors were advised under subsection (2)(b) that the coroner still wishes to direct that the post-mortem be performed, none of them has lodged an objection under this subsection in the High Court.
    
    (4) In calculating the 48-hour period in subsection (3), hours count only if they are hours of working days.
    
    (5) An objection under subsection (3) is lodged by originating application in the manner provided by the [High Court Rules][239] (as defined in [section 2][240] of the Judicature Act 1908).

##### 35 Procedure for objection in High Court
    
*   (1) Judges of the High Court and employees of the Ministry of Justice must ensure an objection lodged in the High Court under [section 34(3)][40] (the _objection_) is disposed of as a matter of priority and urgency.
    
    (2) The Registrar must allocate a date for the hearing of the objection that is no later than 1 working day after the date on which the objection is lodged.
    
    (3) If the objection is lodged at a Registry of the High Court in a place where no High Court Judge is at that time available, the Registrar must ensure that the objection is dealt with in some other place within the time limit referred to in subsection (2); and any other Registrar or employee of the Ministry of Justice whose help is sought by the Registrar in whose Registry the application is filed has a corresponding obligation.
    
    (4) If subsection (3) applies, the Registrar must---
        
    *   (a) make any urgent enquiries necessary to determine where and by whom the objection can most conveniently and expeditiously be dealt with; and
    
    *   (b) forward the objection and any other relevant documents without delay to the Registrar at the place where the application is to be dealt with; and
    
    *   (c) without delay, inform every party to the proceeding of the action taken under this section.
    
    (5) Subsections (3) and (4) apply in substitution for any provision of the [High Court Rules][239] relating to the transfer of notices of application filed at a time when a Judge is not present.
    
    (6) The High Court must either uphold the objection, or dismiss it by ordering that the coroner may direct under [section 31][37] that the post-mortem be performed.
    
    Compare: 2001 No 31 [ss 9][241], [10][242]

##### 36 Nature of post-mortem
    
*   (1) A post-mortem directed under [section 31][37] is a full internal and external examination of the body unless the coroner, in the relevant direction under section 31, requires only a lesser examination.
    
    (2) Before requiring only a lesser examination in the relevant direction under [section 31][37], the coroner must---
        
    *   (a) consult the New Zealand Police about any evidential matters that may make a full internal and external examination of the body necessary or desirable; and
    
    *   (b) consult the pathologist whom the coroner proposes to direct to perform in the examination about whether the lesser examination proposed would or may limit that pathologist's ability to determine the cause of death.
    
    

##### 37 Post-mortem may be performed early in some cases
    
*   (1) If satisfied that there is good reason to do so, a coroner may, under [section 31][37], direct a pathologist to perform a post-mortem immediately.
    
    (2) Good reason may exist for the purposes of subsection (1)---
        
    *   (a) because any delay would or may limit the pathologist's ability to determine the cause of death; or
    
    *   (b) because the person concerned is an infant; or
    
    *   (c) because people having the ethnic origins, social attitudes or customs, or spiritual beliefs of, or of a member of the immediate family of, the person concerned, customarily require bodies to be available to family members as soon as possible after death.
    
    (3) Subsection (2) does not limit subsection (1).

    *   (d) a doctor, nurse, or funeral director attending as the representative of the family of the person who is, or of a person who is suspected to be, the dead person concerned, if authorised to attend by a coroner on an application for the purpose by or on behalf of that family:
    
    *   (e) a doctor attending as the representative of a person (**A**) who has been, or may be, charged with a criminal offence relating to the death concerned or its circumstances, if authorised to attend by a coroner on an application for the purpose by or on behalf of A:
    
    *   (f) any other doctor, or person training to be a doctor, if authorised to attend (for training purposes, or for any other purposes specified) by a coroner on an application for the purpose by or on behalf of the pathologist directed to perform the post-mortem:
    
    *   (g) a member of the police:
    
    *   (h) any other person, if authorised to attend by a coroner.
    
    (2) No doctor, nurse, or funeral director is responsible for the conduct of, or may participate in otherwise than by observing, a post-mortem just because he or she attends the post-mortem as a representative in accordance with subsection (1)(d) or (e).

Inquiries into causes and circumstances of deaths

#### Inquiries

##### 57 Purposes of inquiries
    
*   (1) A coroner opens and conducts an inquiry (including any related inquest) for the 3 purposes stated in this section, and not to determine civil, criminal, or disciplinary liability.
    
    (2) The first purpose is to establish, so far as possible,---
        
    *   (a) that a person has died; and
    
    *   (b) the person's identity; and
    
    *   (c) when and where the person died; and
    
    *   (d) the causes of the death; and
    
    *   (e) the circumstances of the death.
    
    (3) The second purpose is to make specified recommendations or comments (as defined in [section 9][10]) that, in the coroner's opinion, may, if drawn to public attention, reduce the chances of the occurrence of other deaths in circumstances similar to those in which the death occurred.
    
    (4) The third purpose is to determine whether the public interest would be served by the death being investigated by other investigating authorities in the performance or exercise of their functions, powers, or duties, and to refer the death to them if satisfied that the public interest would be served by their investigating it in the performance or exercise of their functions, powers, or duties.

    *   (a) indicating an intention to do so; and
    
    *   (b) adjourning the inquiry for at least 5 working days; and
    
    *   (c) notifying every member of the person's immediate family who during the adjournment requests the coroner to do so of the proposed comment; and
    
    *   (d) giving every such member a reasonable opportunity to be heard, either personally or by counsel, in relation to the proposed comment.
    
    (3) The coroner must not comment adversely on a living person, corporation sole, body corporate, or unincorporated body without---
        
    *   (a) taking all reasonable steps to notify the person, corporation, or body of the proposed comment; and
    
    *   (b) giving the person, corporation, or body a reasonable opportunity to be heard, either personally or by counsel, in relation to the proposed comment.
    
    (4) Notifications, or opportunities to be heard, required to be given to a body corporate or unincorporated body must be given to an officer or other representative of the body who is, or appears to be, authorised by the body for the purpose.
