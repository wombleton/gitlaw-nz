## Part 1A  
Setting rents for pastoral leases
    
*   Part 1A: inserted, on 6 July 2012, by [section 6][196] of the Crown Pastoral Land (Rent for Pastoral Leases) Amendment Act 2012 (2012 No 36).

##### 23A Purpose of this Part
    
*   (1) The purpose of this Part is to establish a framework for specifying an efficient, predictable, and objective process to set rents for pastoral leases based on---
        
    *   (a) the productive capacity of the land when used for pastoral farming; and
    
    *   (b) the earnings available from that productive capacity.
    
    (2) To help to achieve the purpose of this Part, the framework set out in this Part---
        
    *   (a) includes a formula with the following elements:
            
        *   (i) the base carrying capacity of a pastoral lease as an easily calculated proxy for the stock the land would carry in an unimproved state; and
        
        *   (ii) the current carrying capacity of a pastoral lease as an approximate measure of the stock the land would carry when developed and farmed efficiently, which allows the element in subparagraph (iii) to be calculated; and
        
        *   (iii) a factor to incorporate 0.15 of the difference between the current carrying capacity and the base carrying capacity into the formula; and
        
        *   (iv) a dollar-per-stock-unit rate that incorporates a proportion of net earnings per stock unit into the formula; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) fixes the values of some elements of the formula and prescribes or constrains inquiry into the values for other elements of the formula, namely,---
            
        *   (i) the dollar-per-stock-unit rate is calculated according to a method prescribed in regulations using available data about net farm incomes on farms comparable to those on pastoral leases; and
        
        *   (ii) the base carrying capacity is to be agreed or determined once according to rules made by the Valuer-General, including rules about using scientific evidence that is predictive of the base carrying capacity and information about the land; and
        
        *   (iii) the current carrying capacity is to be agreed or determined at each review according to rules made by the Valuer-General, including rules about using information about efficient farming practices and information about the land; and
        
        
    
    *   (c) provides for a dispute resolution system to facilitate early agreement between the Crown and lessees on the base carrying capacity and the current carrying capacity.
    
    Section 23A: inserted, on 6 July 2012, by [section 6][196] of the Crown Pastoral Land (Rent for Pastoral Leases) Amendment Act 2012 (2012 No 36).

##### 23B Formula for calculating annual rents for pastoral leases
    
*   (1) Despite anything in any other enactment or in any instrument, the annual rent for a pastoral lease that has a rent review date on or after the date on which this section comes into force must be calculated in accordance with the formula set out in subsection (2) and the formula set out in subsection (3), and the annual rent payable is the greater of the 2 amounts so calculated.
    
    (2) The following formula must be used to calculate the annual rent for any pastoral lease to which subsection (1) applies:
    
    a = b × (c + ((d -- c) × 0.15)) 
    
    where---
    
    **a**
    > 
    > is the annual rent for the pastoral lease
    
    **b**
    > 
    > is the dollar-per-stock-unit rate published by the Valuer-General in the _Gazette_ that applies to the rent review date
    
    **c**
    > 
    > is the base carrying capacity of the pastoral lease as determined under this Part and any regulations or rules made under this Part
    
    **d**
    > 
    > is the current carrying capacity of the pastoral lease as determined under this Part and any regulations or rules made under this Part.
    
    (3) The following formula must also be used to calculate the annual rent for any pastoral lease to which subsection (1) applies:
    
    b × c
    
    where---
    
    **b**
    > 
    > is the dollar-per-stock-unit rate published by the Valuer-General in the _Gazette_ that applies to the rent review date
    
    **c**
    > 
    > is the base carrying capacity of the pastoral lease as determined under this Part and any regulations or rules made under this Part.

    *   (b) ending on the close of the day that is 90 days before the next rent review date.
    
    (2) However, subsection (1) does not apply if the base carrying capacity of the pastoral lease has been determined previously under this Part.
    
    (3) The Commissioner must appoint a Crown assessor to make an initial assessment of the current carrying capacity of a pastoral lease during the period---

    (2) The following sections apply to a substantive proposal under this Part as if it were a substantive proposal under [Part 2][48] (but as if the reference in [section 62(1)][97] to its acceptance were a reference to its adoption):
        
    *   (a) [section 62][97] (which requires the Commissioner to prepare a final plan of the land to which an accepted substantive proposal relates):
    
    *   (b) [section 63][98] (which relates to the approval of a final plan by the Chief Surveyor):

    *   (a) depending on its designation in the plan,---
            
        *   (i) as conservation area, or for the Crown purpose specified; or
        
        *   (ii) as a reserve, held for the purpose specified in the plan; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) subject to the easements (if any) whose continuation in force is provided for in the substantive proposal concerned; and

*   [Section 80][115] (which enables the creation of protective mechanisms provided for in an accepted substantive proposal under [Part 2][48]) applies to an approved plan arising out of the adoption of a substantive proposal under this Part as if it were an approved plan arising out of the acceptance of a substantive proposal under Part 2\.

*   (1) A substantive proposal under [Part 2][48] or [Part 3][118] dealing with any land held under an occupation licence may specify 1 or more holder's improvements that are to remain on the land; and in that case---
        
    *   (a) the holder must not remove any improvement specified from the land, or cause or permit it to be removed from the land; but
    
    *   (b) if when the licence expires or is surrendered the improvement is still on the land, the holder is entitled to compensation for it (being an amount equal to the added value that it then gives the land).

##### 96 Implementation not subdivision
    
*   (1) Taking action under [Part 2][48] or [Part 3][118] so that different parts of any land are dealt with in different manners is not a subdivision of the land for the purposes of the [Resource Management Act 1991][204].
    
    (2) Subsection (1) is for the avoidance of doubt.

##### 97 Sustainable management covenants
    
*   (1) Despite any enactment or rule of law, there may be reserved over land disposed of under [Part 2][48] or [Part 3][118] a covenant in favour of the Commissioner providing for the management of the land, and the monitoring of activities undertaken on the land and their effects on the land.
    
    (2) A sustainable management covenant runs with the land over which it was reserved; and is an interest in land for the purposes of the [Land Transfer Act 1952][227].

    (2) [Section 84][121] applies to the exercise of the Commissioner's powers under [section 97][137] in relation to the disposal of land under [Part 3][118] as if section 97 were part of Part 3\.

##### 100 Application of sections 17 and 18 of Land Act 1948
    
*   Except as provided in [section 89(2)][127], neither [section 17][223] nor [section 18][228] of the Land Act 1948 applies to any decision made under [Part 2][48], [Part 3][118], or this Part.
