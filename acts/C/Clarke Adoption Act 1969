An Act to give to an interim order of adoption made on 22 September 1965 in favour of Geoffrey Henry Clarke and Rhoda Merle Clarke as adopting parents of Kevin John Clarke such force and effect as if it had been a final order of adoption made on the same day
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    Whereas Kevin John Clarke (hereinafter called the _child_) was born on 6 February 1965 and was the subject of an application for adoption made to the Magistrate's at Hamilton by Geoffrey Henry Clarke late of Hamilton driver deceased (hereinafter called the _father_) and Rhoda Merle Clarke his wife (hereinafter called the _mother_) upon which an interim order was made in favour of the father and the mother on 22 September 1965: 
    
    And whereas the father died on 18 November 1965: 
    
    And whereas no application for a final order of adoption of the child had or could have been made prior to the death of the father but such application was made by the mother on 14 March 1966 and on the same day such final order was made and expressed to be in favour of the mother only: 
    
    And whereas the mother desires to have the father's name also shown as a parent on the said final order and in the new birth certificate of the child: 
    
    And whereas it appears that this can be effected only by enacting that the interim order of adoption in respect of the child shall be deemed for all purposes to be and always to have been a final order.

##### 1 Short Title

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Clarke Adoption Act 1969\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 29 September 1969, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][6] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][7] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][8] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][9] and [17E][10] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
