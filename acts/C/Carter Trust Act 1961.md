An Act to vary the trusts of the will of the late Charles Rooking Carter and to facilitate establishment of a home for aged persons in Carterton
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    Whereas the Public Trustee is the trustee of the will dated 6 June 1896 of Charles Rooking Carter, late of Wellington in New Zealand, gentleman (hereinafter called _the testator_):
    
    And whereas the Public Trustee holds as such trustee certain pieces of land comprising in all 2 178 acres 3 roods 2.7 perches, more or less, situated near the Borough of Carterton, certain sums of money, and certain furniture and other household articles:
    
    And whereas by [section 43][22] of the Reserves and Other Lands Disposal and Public Bodies Empowering Act 1916 the powers of the Public Trustee in respect of the said land were enlarged and the name of the charitable institution erected on part of the said land in accordance with the provisions of the said will was changed from the Carterton Home for Aged Poor Men to the Carter Homes, and the conditions of eligibility for admission to the said homes were varied and provision was made for certain other matters:
    
    And whereas the Carter Homes, owing to their situation and for other reasons, are no longer suitable as a home for old people:
    
    And whereas a society, called the Carter Society Incorporated, has been incorporated under the provisions of the [Incorporated Societies Act 1908][23] with the object of establishing a new home for aged persons in the Borough of Carterton:
    
    And whereas it is intended that on the establishment of the said new home any persons then living in the Carter Homes should be transferred to the said new home and the Carter Homes should be closed:
    
    And whereas it is the desire of the said society that funds which would otherwise have been used for the purposes of the Carter Homes should be available for the maintenance of the proposed new home:
    
    And whereas the Carter Homes Committee and the Public Trustee consider that the said proposals are reasonable and proper:
    
    And whereas the Carter Homes Committee desires to be relieved of its responsibilities in regard to the Carter Homes on the establishment of the proposed new home.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Carter Trust Act 1961\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 March 2002, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][30] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][31] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][32] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][33] and [17E][34] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   â¢omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   â¢typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   â¢layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   â¢indentation
        *   â¢position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   â¢format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   â¢format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   â¢position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   â¢punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   â¢Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   â¢case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   â¢format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   â¢small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   â¢schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   â¢running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   â¢format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
