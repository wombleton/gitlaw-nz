    *   (a) pricing methodologies:
    
    *   (b) methodologies for evaluating or determining the cost of capital.

##### 53H Overview of negotiate/arbitrate regulation
    
*   (1) If a regulated supplier is subject to negotiate/arbitrate regulation,---
        
    *   (a) the supplier must enter into negotiations with parties identified by the Commission in order to reach agreement on the matters identified by the Commission (being the prices and quality standards associated with regulated goods or services) that will apply for the regulatory period specified by the Commission; and
    
    *   (b) if the negotiations fail to reach a settlement of all the matters within the time frames set by the Commission, the parties must enter into arbitration to resolve the outstanding matters; and
    
    *   (c) the terms of the arbitration are set by the Commission, and the arbitral award is binding on the parties unless or until they agree to vary it.
    
    (2) This section is only a guide.

    *   (f) the processes for negotiations, including the form of involvement by the parties, and the form, scope, and coverage of any negotiated settlement:
    
    *   (g) the time frames for the negotiations (including stages in negotiations) and, in particular, the date by which, if negotiations are not complete, the parties must enter into arbitration to settle any remaining unresolved matters:
    
    *   (h) the terms of any compulsory arbitration that takes place under [section 53J][121], including its form, procedures, the allocation of costs, and powers of the arbitrator:

    (2) The Commission may include in the determination any other matters it considers necessary or desirable to promote the purpose of negotiate/arbitrate regulation.
    
    (3) If the parties to a negotiation agree to arbitration, the arbitration may be on whatever terms they agree to, but must be completed within the time frames set for the negotiation.
    
    (4) The Commission may extend any time frames set out in a [section 52P][95] determination.
    
    (5) The terms of arbitration set by the Commission must---
        
    *   (a) allow the parties a reasonable period within which to agree on an arbitrator but, if agreement is not reached within that period (or any extended period allowed under subsection (4)), the terms must provide that the Commission must appoint the arbitrator (and may not appoint itself as the arbitrator); and
    
    *   (b) include provisions enabling the parties to enforce the arbitral award; and
    
    *   (c) include a right of appeal to the High Court, exercisable by any party to the arbitration, on a point of law only.

*   Subpart 6: inserted, on 14 October 2008, by [section 4][487] of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No 70).

##### 53K Purpose of default/customised price-quality regulation
    
*   The purpose of default/customised price-quality regulation is to provide a relatively low-cost way of setting price-quality paths for suppliers of regulated goods or services, while allowing the opportunity for individual regulated suppliers to have alternative price-quality paths that better meet their particular circumstances.
    
    Section 53K: inserted, on 14 October 2008, by [section 4][487] of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No 70).

*   (1) If goods or services are subject to default/customised price-quality regulation,---
        
    *   (a) the Commission sets default price-quality paths that apply for a regulatory period, and all regulated suppliers must apply those default price-quality paths; but
    
    *   (b) individual suppliers may make a proposal to the Commission for a customised price-quality path; and
    
    *   (c) the Commission may set a customised price-quality path for the supplier, and that then applies for a set period instead of a specified default price-quality path.
    
    (2) This section is only a guide.
    
    Section 53L: inserted, on 14 October 2008, by [section 4][487] of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No 70).

##### 53M Content and timing of price-quality paths
    
*   (1) Every price-quality path (whether a default price-quality path or a customised price-quality path under this subpart, or an individual price-quality path under [subpart 7][144]) must specify,---
        
    *   (a) in relation to prices, either or both of the following with respect to a specified regulatory period:
            
        *   (i) the maximum price or prices that may be charged by a regulated supplier:
        
        *   (ii) the maximum revenues that may be recovered by a regulated supplier; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) the quality standards that must be met by the regulated supplier; and
    
    *   (c) the regulatory period.
    
    (2) A price-quality path may include incentives for an individual supplier to maintain or improve its quality of supply, and those incentives may include (without limitation) any of the following:
        
    *   (a) penalties by way of a reduction in the supplier's maximum prices or revenues based on whether, or by what amount, the supplier fails to meet the required quality standards:
    
    *   (b) rewards by way of an increase in the supplier's maximum prices or revenue based on whether, or by what amount, the supplier meets or exceeds the required quality standards:
    
    *   (c) consumer compensation schemes that set minimum standards of performance and require the supplier to pay prescribed amounts of compensation to consumers if it fails to meet those standards:
    
    *   (d) reporting requirements, including special reporting requirements in asset management plans, if the supplier fails to meet the quality standards.
    
    (3) Quality standards may be prescribed in any way the Commission considers appropriate (such as targets, bands, or formulae) and may include (without limitation)---
        
    *   (a) responsiveness to consumers; and
    
    *   (b) in relation to electricity lines services, reliability of supply, reduction in energy losses, and voltage stability or other technical requirements.
    
    (4) A regulatory period must be 5 years.
    
    (5) However, the Commission may set a shorter period than 5 years if it considers that it would better meet the purposes of this Part, but in any event may not set a term less than 4 years.
    
    (6) Subsections (4) and (5) are subject to [section 53W][137].
    
    (7) No default price-quality path applies to a supplier until the date specified in the relevant [section 52P][95] determination, which must be a date at least 4 months after a summary of the determination is published in the _Gazette_ under section 52P(7)(b).

##### 53N Monitoring compliance with price-quality paths
    
*   For the purpose of monitoring compliance with a price-quality path (whether a default price-quality path or a customised price-quality path under this subpart, or an individual price-quality path under [subpart 7][144]), the Commission may, in addition to exercising its powers under [section 98][369], issue a written notice to a regulated supplier requiring it to provide any or all of the following:
        
    *   (a) a written statement that states whether or not the supplier has complied with the price-quality path applying to that supplier:
    
    *   (b) a report on the written statement referred to in paragraph (a) that is signed by an auditor in accordance with any form specified by the Commission:
    
    *   (c) sufficient information to enable the Commission to properly determine whether all applicable price-quality paths have been complied with:
    
    *   (d) a certificate, in the form specified by the Commission and signed by at least 1 director of the supplier, confirming the truth and accuracy of any information provided under this section.

*   If default price-quality regulation applies to regulated goods or services, the [section 52P][95] determination must set out a default price-quality path that includes---
        
    *   (a) the starting prices that apply to the supply of the goods or services during the first regulatory period; and
    
    *   (b) the rate or rates of change in prices, relative to the Consumer Price Index, allowed during the first regulatory period; and
    
    *   (c) the quality standards that apply during the first regulatory period; and
    
    *   (d) the date or dates on which the default price-quality path (or any part of it) takes effect; and
    
    *   (e) the annual date by which any proposal for a customised price-quality path must be received; and
    
    *   (f) the annual date by which compliance must be demonstrated in accordance with [section 53N][126].
    
    Section 53O: inserted, on 14 October 2008, by [section 4][487] of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No 70).

##### 53P Resetting starting prices, rates of change, and quality standards
    
*   (1) Before the end of the first and every subsequent regulatory period, the Commission must amend the [section 52P][95] determination by setting out the starting prices (as referred to in [section 53O(a)][128]), rates of change (as referred to in section 53O(b)), and quality standards (as referred to in section 53O(c)) that apply for the following regulatory period.
    
    (2) In resetting starting prices, rates of change, and quality standards, the Commission must consult with interested parties.
    
    (3) The starting prices must be either---
        
    *   (a) the prices that applied at the end of the preceding regulatory period; or
    
    *   (b) prices, determined by the Commission, that are based on the current and projected profitability of each supplier.
    
    (4) Starting prices set in accordance with subsection (3)(b) must not seek to recover any excessive profits made during any earlier period.
    
    (5) Subject to subsection (8), the Commission must set only 1 rate of change per type of regulated goods or services (for example, if the rate of change (__x__) is 1% in a CPI−_x_ path, 1% must be the rate for all goods or services of that type).
    
    (6) The rate of change must be based on the long-run average productivity improvement rate achieved by either or both of suppliers in New Zealand, and suppliers in other comparable countries, of the relevant goods or services, using whatever measures of productivity the Commission considers appropriate.
    
    (7) When setting the rate of change, the Commission may take into account the effects of inflation on the inputs of suppliers of the relevant goods or services.
    
    (8) The Commission may set alternative rates of change for a particular supplier---
        
    *   (a) as an alternative, in whole or in part, to the starting prices set under subsection (3)(b) if, in the Commission's opinion, this is necessary or desirable to minimise any undue financial hardship to the supplier or to minimise price shock to consumers; or
    
    *   (b) as an incentive (under [section 53M(2)][125]) for the supplier to improve its quality of supply.
    
    (9) Any alternative rates of change set under subsection (8) may include step changes.
    
    (10) The Commission may not, for the purposes of this section, use comparative benchmarking on efficiency in order to set starting prices, rates of change, quality standards, or incentives to improve quality of supply.
    
    (11) If starting prices, rates of change, and quality standards have not been set by way of an amendment to the relevant [section 52P][95] determination by the end of the regulatory period to which it applies, the starting prices, rates of change, and quality standards that apply at the end of the regulatory period continue to apply until the reset starting prices, rates of change, and quality standards are set.

##### 53Q Supplier may propose customised price-quality path
    
*   (1) At any time after a default price-quality path is set by the Commission, a supplier that is (or is likely to be) subject to the default price-quality path may make a proposal to the Commission for a customised price-quality path to apply to that supplier.
    
    (2) Every proposal must---
        
    *   (a) comply with the input methodologies referred to in [section 52T(1)(d)][100] relating to the process for, and content of, customised price-quality path proposals; and

    *   (c) include the standard application fee for customised price-quality path proposals; and
    
    *   (d) apply or adopt all relevant input methodologies.
    
    (3) A supplier may make only 1 proposal during a regulatory period, and may not make a proposal within the 12 months before a default price-quality path is due to be reset.
    
    (4) A supplier that makes a proposal must make it publicly available as soon as practicable after it has been made to the Commission.

    (2) If the proposal does not comply with those requirements, the Commission may, at its discretion,---
        
    *   (a) discontinue any consideration of the proposal; or
    
    *   (b) request the supplier to remedy the deficiencies in the proposal by providing additional information within 40 working days.
    
    (3) If the supplier fails to provide any additional information requested by the Commission under subsection (2)(b), the Commission may discontinue any consideration of the proposal.
    
    (4) If a proposal is discontinued under subsection (2) or (3), [section 53Q(3)][96] does not apply and the supplier may make another proposal within the regulatory period (except in the 12 months before the default price-quality path is due to be reset).

##### 53V Determination setting customised price-quality path
    
*   (1) The Commission may determine any customised price-quality path that the Commission considers appropriate for a supplier that has made a proposal.
    
    (2) To avoid doubt, and without limitation, in determining a customised price-quality path that complies with [section 53M][125] the Commission may do any of the following:
        
    *   (a) set a price-quality path that is lower, or otherwise less favourable to the regulated supplier, than the default price-quality path that would otherwise apply:
    
    *   (b) if it sets a lower or a higher price than applied under the default price-quality path, apply claw-back:
    
    *   (c) with the agreement of the supplier, vary an input methodology that would otherwise apply to the supplier.
    
    (3) A customised price-quality path for a supplier is imposed by way of an amendment to the [section 52P][95] determination relating to the default/customised price-quality regulation applying to the supplier.

##### 53X What happens when customised price-quality path ends
    
*   (1) When the customised price-quality path of a supplier of goods or services ends, the supplier is subject to the default price-quality path that is generally applicable to other suppliers of those goods or services.
    
    (2) The starting prices that apply at the beginning of the default price-quality path are those that applied at the end of the customised price-quality path unless, at least 4 months before the end of the customised price-quality path, the Commission advises the supplier that different starting prices must apply.
    
    (3) The supplier remains subject to the default price-quality path until---
        
    *   (a) the end of the period for which it applies to other suppliers; or
    
    *   (b) a new customised price-quality path begins to apply to the supplier.
    
    (4) To avoid doubt, a supplier who is or was subject to a customised price-quality path may apply in accordance with [section 53Q][131] for another customised price-quality path.

    (3) If an input methodology is published after 1 April 2010 and if, had that methodology applied at the time the default price-quality paths were reset as required by subsection (1), it would have resulted in a materially different path being set, then the Commission may reset the default price-quality paths in accordance with [section 53P][129] and may apply claw-back, despite [section 53ZB(1)][143].
    
    (4) However, the Commission may not exercise its powers in subsection (3) later than 9 months after the date of publication of the input methodology.

    (2) However, if a supplier has increased its weighted average prices by more than the movement, or forecast movement, in the all groups index number of the New Zealand Consumer Price Index in the period beginning 1 January 2008 and ending with the date that the determination is made, the Commission may apply claw-back to the extent of requiring the supplier to lower its prices in order to compensate consumers for some or all of any over-recovery of revenues that occurred during that period.
    
    (3) The Commission may set a default price-quality path in respect of suppliers of gas pipeline services even if all or any of the relevant input methodologies have not been determined.
    
    (4) If an input methodology is published after a [section 52P][95] determination referred to in subsection (1) is made, and if, had that methodology applied at the time the default price-quality paths were set as required by subsection (1), it would have resulted in a materially different path being set, then the Commission may reset the default price-quality paths and may apply claw-back, despite [section 53ZB(1)][143].
    
    (5) However, the Commission may not exercise its powers in subsection (4) later than 9 months after the date of publication of the input methodology.
