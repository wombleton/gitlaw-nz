An Act to declare the trusts upon which certain real and personal property is now held by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints Trust Board, a Trust Board duly incorporated under the provisions of the Religious, Charitable, and Educational Trusts Act 1908 and having its registered office at Scotia Place in the City of Auckland (hereinafter referred to as the Board), and to declare the trusts upon which real and personal property hereinafter vested in or acquired by the Board is to be held and to confer certain necessary powers upon the Board and to provide rules for the Board and for other incidental matters to facilitate the management and administration of such real and personal property vested in the Board
    
*   #### Preamble
    
    Whereas in or about the year 1830 a number of persons of certain religious convictions constituted the religious denomination commonly known as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints as originally organised in the State of New York, United States of America, and thereafter established and constituted as a church body and fully organised in Salt Lake City, State of Utah in the United States of America, and elsewhere (such religious body as so constituted and established being hereinafter referred to as **the Church**): 
    
    And whereas in the year 1854 two members of the Church, being the Elders Augustus Farnhan and William Cooke, came at the request and with the approval of Brigham Young, the then President of the Church, to the then Colony of New Zealand as missionaries on behalf of the Church and undertook as missionaries the teaching of the doctrine and beliefs of the Church in New Zealand, and in due course of time there was established and constituted a branch of the Church in New Zealand, but more commonly designated **a mission** by the members of the Church, and for furtherance of the work of the Church in New Zealand there was acquired in the name of one Joseph F Smith, of the City of Salt Lake, State of Utah in the United States of America, the then President of the Church, a certain parcel of land in Queen Street, Auckland, upon which was erected a chapel for public worship after the manner and in accordance with the usages and beliefs of the Church, and also other lands were from time to time acquired as sites for chapels and homes for officers and elders and generally for the purposes of the Church in New Zealand: 
    
    And whereas the said Joseph F Smith died on or about 19 November 1918, and letters of administration _cum testamento annexo_ of his estate in New Zealand were granted by the Supreme Court of New Zealand at Auckland on 21 February 1921, to one George Shepard Taylor, then residing in the City of Auckland: 
    
    And whereas it being desirable to constitute in New Zealand a corporate trustee in which could be vested all property both real and personal then held for the purposes of the Church in New Zealand and all property real and personal subsequently for those purposes acquired, Heber Jeddy Grant, Charles Wilson Nibley, George Albert Smith, Joseph Fielding Smith, Stephen L Richards, Richard Roswell Lyman, and Melvin Joseph Ballard, being officers and members of the said Church, and all residing in the State of Utah in the United States of America, and acting at the request and with the consent and approval of the First Presidency as the governing authority of the said Church, filed in the Supreme Court of New Zealand at Auckland on 9 May 1921, a memorial executed pursuant to the provisions of the Religious, Charitable, and Educational Trusts Act 1908 (New Zealand) and obtained as and from 9 May 1921, incorporation of the Board and thereafter the said parcel of land at Auckland and all other lands then so vested in the aforesaid Joseph F Smith were, at the request of the said Board, by conveyance and transfer duly executed by the said George Shepard Taylor (and with the recital that all such lands and premises as so previously vested in the said Joseph F Smith had been purchased with the funds of the Church) conveyed or transferred to the Board and all property subsequently acquired by or for the Church in New Zealand has been duly acquired by and vested in the Board: 
    
    And whereas the incorporation of the Board was not, as far as can be ascertained by search and inquiry, preceded by the execution of a declaration of trust specifically declaring the trusts, powers, and authorities of the incorporating trustees and the Board, and that, apart from the general recognised trust for the religious, charitable, and educational purposes of the Church in New Zealand, there exists, so far as diligent search and inquiry can ascertain, no declared trusts regarding the said lands and funds so vested in the Board and subsequently to the incorporation acquired by and vested in the Board: 
    
    And whereas since the incorporation of the Board the governing authority of the Church has provided extensive funds for the furtherance of the work of the Church in New Zealand, and these funds have been placed at the disposal of the Board, and have in large measure been employed by the Board in the purchase of many properties comprising chapel sites, homes for the officers of the Church, hostels, colleges, temples, and for the general purposes work and extension of the Church in New Zealand: 
    
    And whereas, in view of the inability to locate or discover any declaration of trust declaring the trusts upon which the Board now holds the real and personal property vested in it and the trusts upon which property real and personal subsequently acquired or vested in the Board is to be held, it is desirous that the said trusts be declared, that certain necessary provisions be made to the constitution of the Board, that appointment of the existing trustees be confirmed, that provision be made for the appointments of successive trustees, and that certain essential and necessary powers be conferred upon the Board and that other administrative matters be defined.

## Schedule

## First Part  
The beliefs of the Church and doctrines

The principal beliefs of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints are set forth in a statement designated as Articles of Faith, which for a period of more than 100 years has been issued and distributed throughout the world. The Articles of Faith are as follows:
    
*   1 We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost.

*   2 We believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and not for Adam's transgression.

*   3 We believe that through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel.

*   4 We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel are: First, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; Second, Repentance; Third, Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; Fourth, Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost.

*   5 We believe that a man must be called of God, by prophecy, and by the laying on of hands, by those who are in authority to preach the Gospel and administer in the ordinances thereof.

*   6 We believe in the same organisation that existed in the Primitive Church, viz, apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists, etc.

*   7 We believe in the gift of tongues, prophecy, revelation, visions, healing, interpretation of tongues, etc.

*   8 We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly; we also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God.

*   9 We believe all that God has revealed, all that he does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.

*   10 We believe in the literal gathering of Israel and in the restoration of the Ten Tribes; that Zion will be built upon this (the American) continent; that Christ will reign personally upon the earth; and, that the earth will be renewed and receive its paradisiacal glory.

*   11 We claim the privilege of worshipping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, where, or what they may.

*   12 We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the Law.

*   13 We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men; indeed, we may say that we follow the admonition of Paul -- We believe all things, we hope all things, we have endured many things, and hope to be able to endure all things. If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things -- Joseph Smith.

The objectives of the Church are to bear witness to the divinity of the Lord Jesus Christ; to teach all men the principles of His Gospel; and to convert and persuade them to follow in His ways and keep the commandments of God, that they may thus advance the Kingdom of God in the earth to bring brotherhood and peace to men and nations, and earn exaltation for themselves.

To achieve this objective the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints builds and maintains churches, temples, educational institutions for all ages, recreational buildings and facilities, and projects designed to teach and encourage vocational and industrial preparation for self-reliant living. It teaches loyalty to country and fosters good citizenship in all communities where it is established.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints Trust Board Empowering Act 1957\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 January 2004, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][24] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][25] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][26] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][27] and [17E][28] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
