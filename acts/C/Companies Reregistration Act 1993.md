    (2) On any application under this section, the court may, if it is satisfied that the applicant has been prejudiced as a result of the reregistration, make such order as it thinks fit, including, without limiting the generality of this subsection, an order---
        
    *   (a) requiring the company or any other person to acquire the applicant's shares; or

    *   (b) in the case of an unlimited company or a company limited by guarantee, under an undertaking to contribute to the assets of the company in the event of its being wound up,---
    
    is cancelled or reduced, the cancellation or reduction of that liability shall, for the purposes of this section, be treated as a distribution of the amount by which that liability is reduced made to that person in his or her capacity as a shareholder in the company on its reregistration.
    
    (2) A distribution may be recovered from a shareholder if, immediately after reregistration, the company was unable to pay its debts, including contingent debts, as they became due in the normal course of business unless,---
        
    *   (a) on the reregistration of the company, the shareholder had no knowledge that the company was unable to so pay its debts; and
    
    *   (b) the shareholder has altered the shareholder's position in reliance on the validity of the distribution; and
    
    *   (c) it would be unfair to require repayment in full or at all.
    
    (3) A distribution may be recovered from a director, if immediately after reregistration, the company was unable to pay its debts, including contingent debts, as they became due in the normal course of business.
    
    (4) If, in an action against a shareholder under this section, the court is satisfied that the liability of that person could properly have been reduced by a lesser amount without resulting in the company being unable to pay its debts, the court may allow that person to retain an amount equal to the value of the distribution that could properly have been made.
    
    (5) If, in an action against a director under this section, the court is satisfied that there were reasonable grounds for believing that the liability of the shareholder could properly have been reduced by the amount of the distribution or a lesser amount without resulting in the company being unable to pay its debts, the court may relieve the director from liability in respect of that amount or lesser amount, as the case may be.
    
    (6) The amount that may be recovered from a director is limited to the amount that is not able to be recovered from a shareholder under subsection (2).

##### 16 Service of documents
    
*   (1) [Section 391][31] of the Companies Act 1993 shall apply, with such modifications as may be necessary, in relation to the sending of any notice or other document to a member of a company under this Act.
    
    (2) [Section 391][31] of the Companies Act 1993 shall apply, with such modifications as may be necessary, in relation to the sending of any notice or other document under this Act to a specified person.

##### 17 Offences
    
*   (1) Every director of a company who,---
        
    *   (a) having voted in favour of a resolution referred to in subsection (1)(a)(ii) of [section 4][5], fails to sign a certificate in accordance with subsection (1)(b) of that section; or
    
    *   (b) having voted in favour of a resolution referred to in paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of [section 6][7], fails to sign a certificate in accordance with paragraph (c) of that subsection,---
    
    commits an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000\.
    
    (2) Where a company fails to comply with [section 10(4)][11], the company and every director of the company commits an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000\.
    
    (3) It is a defence to a director charged with an offence against subsection (2) if the director proves that---
        
    *   (a) the company took all reasonable and proper steps to ensure that the requirements of [section 10(4)][11] would be complied with; or
    
    *   (b) he or she took all reasonable steps to ensure that the company complied with the requirements of that subsection; or
    
    *   (c) in the circumstances he or she could not reasonably have been expected to take steps to ensure that the company complied with the requirements of that subsection.
    
    

##### 18 Regulations
    
*   The Governor-General may, from time to time, by Order in Council, make regulations---
        
    *   (a) prescribing fees payable to the Registrar on the making of applications for reregistration and fees may be set at different levels in respect of different periods during the transition period:
    
    *   (b) providing for such other matters, not inconsistent with this Act, as are necessary for giving full effect to this Act and for its due administration.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Companies Reregistration Act 1993\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 3 June 1998, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][33] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][34] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][35] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][36] and [17E][37] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
