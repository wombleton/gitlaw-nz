*   (1) In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, _charitable purpose_ includes every charitable purpose, whether it relates to the relief of poverty, the advancement of education or religion, or any other matter beneficial to the community.
    
    (2) However,---
        
    *   (a) the purpose of a trust, society, or institution is a charitable purpose under this Act if the purpose would satisfy the public benefit requirement apart from the fact that the beneficiaries of the trust, or the members of the society or institution, are related by blood; and
    
    *   (b) a marae has a charitable purpose if the physical structure of the marae is situated on land that is a Maori reservation referred to in [Te Ture Whenua Maori Act 1993 (Maori Land Act 1993][122]) and the funds of the marae are not used for a purpose other than---
            
        *   (i) the administration and maintenance of the land and of the physical structure of the marae:

    (2A) The promotion of amateur sport may be a charitable purpose if it is the means by which a charitable purpose referred to in subsection (1) is pursued.
    
    (3) To avoid doubt, if the purposes of a trust, society, or an institution include a non-charitable purpose (for example, advocacy) that is merely ancillary to a charitable purpose of the trust, society, or institution, the presence of that non-charitable purpose does not prevent the trustees of the trust, the society, or the institution from qualifying for registration as a charitable entity.
    
    (4) For the purposes of subsection (3), a non-charitable purpose is ancillary to a charitable purpose of the trust, society, or institution if the non-charitable purpose is---
        
    *   (a) ancillary, secondary, subordinate, or incidental to a charitable purpose of the trust, society, or institution; and
    
    *   (b) not an independent purpose of the trust, society, or institution.
    
    Section 5(2A): inserted, on 25 February 2012, by [section 5][123] of the Charities Amendment Act 2012 (2012 No 4).

##### 6 Registration of trustees of trusts
    
*   (1) If an entity is, or consists of, the trustees of a trust, the name of that entity must, for the purposes of this Act, be treated as being---
        
    *   (a) the name under which the trustees are incorporated as a Board under the [Charitable Trusts Act 1957][124] if the trustees are incorporated as a Board under that Act; or
    
    *   (b) the name of the trust; or
    
    *   (c) a name nominated by the trustees of the trust if the trust does not otherwise have a name.
    
    (2) The registration of the trustees of a trust as a charitable entity is not affected by---
        
    *   (a) 1 or more of the trustees ceasing to be a trustee of the trust; or
    
    *   (b) the appointment of new trustees of the trust.
    
    (3) Subsections (1) and (2) do not limit [sections 31 to 36][46], and [40][59].

    (2) After that transfer of functions, the only employees of the department who are entitled to be bound by or enforce the collective agreement are those employees who are appointed to a position in the department that has been established (whether or not previously existing in the Commission) to enable the chief executive to perform the transferred functions.
    
    (3) Subsection (2) does not bind an employee to a collective agreement, or entitle an employee to be bound by or enforce a collective agreement, if the employee would not otherwise be bound by, or be entitled to be bound by or enforce, that agreement.
    
    (4) This section limits which employees may be bound by collective agreements (including collective employment contracts), and the coverage of those agreements, under sections 56(1), 57, 62(3), 63(3), and 243 of the Employment Relations Act 2000\.
    
    (5) This section does not apply to a collective agreement to the extent that the parties agree otherwise.

##### 14 Superannuation
    
*   (1) Any employee of the Charities Commission who, immediately before becoming an employee of the department, is a contributor to the Government Superannuation Fund under Part 2 or 2A of the Government Superannuation Fund Act 1956 is deemed, for the purpose of that Act, to be employed in the Government service so long as he or she continues to be an employee of the department.
    
    (2) Subsection (1) does not entitle a person to become a contributor to the Government Superannuation Fund if the person has ceased to be a contributor.
    
    (3) For the purpose of applying the Government Superannuation Fund Act 1956, the chief executive of the department is the controlling authority.

##### 15 Other savings and transitional matters 
    
*   The Governor-General may, by Order in Council, provide for savings and transitional matters connected with the disestablishment of the Charities Commission, including the transfer of functions formerly carried out by the Commission.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Charities Act 2005\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 July 2012, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][187] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][188] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/ ][189] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][190] and [17E][191] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
