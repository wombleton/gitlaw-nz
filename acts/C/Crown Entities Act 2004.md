    *   (a) the functions set out in the entity's Act; and
    
    *   (b) if the entity's Act gives the responsible Minister power to add functions, any other functions that the responsible Minister may direct the entity to perform in accordance with that Act and [section 112][140] of this Act; and
    
    *   (c) any functions that are incidental and related to, or consequential on, its functions set out in paragraphs (a) and (b).
    
    (2) In performing its functions, a statutory entity must act consistently with its objectives.

##### 15 Status of statutory entity
    
*   A statutory entity---
        
    *   (a) is a body corporate; and
    
    *   (b) is accordingly a legal entity separate from its members, office holders, employees, and the Crown; and
    
    *   (c) continues in existence until it is dissolved by an Act.
    
    

##### 16 Core things statutory entities can do
    
*   A statutory entity may do anything authorised by this Act or the entity's Act.

##### 17 Other things statutory entities can do
    
*   (1) A statutory entity may do anything that a natural person of full age and capacity may do.
    
    (2) Subsection (1) applies except as provided in this Act or another Act or rule of law.

##### 18 Acts must be for purpose of functions
    
*   A statutory entity may do an act under [section 16][20] or [section 17][21] only for the purpose of performing its functions.

#### Validity of acts

##### 19 Acts in breach of statute are invalid
    
*   (1) An act of a statutory entity is invalid, unless [section 20][25] applies, if it is---
        
    *   (a) an act that is contrary to, or outside the authority of, an Act; or
    
    *   (b) an act that is done otherwise than for the purpose of performing its functions.
    
    (2) Subsection (1) does not limit any discretion of a court to grant relief in respect of a minor or technical breach.

##### 20 Some natural person acts protected
    
*   (1) [Section 19][24], or any rule of law to similar effect, does not prevent a person dealing with a statutory entity from enforcing a transaction that is a natural person act unless the person dealing with the entity had, or ought reasonably to have had, knowledge---
        
    *   (a) of an express restriction in an Act that makes the act contrary to, or outside the authority of, the Act; or
    
    *   (b) that the act is done otherwise than for the purpose of performing the entity's functions.
    
    (2) A person who relies on subsection (1) has the onus of proving that that person did not have, and ought not reasonably to have had, the knowledge referred to in that subsection.
    
    (3) A statutory entity must report, in its annual report, each transaction that the entity has performed in the year to which the report relates that was invalid under [section 19][24] but enforced in reliance on this section.

*   [Section 20][25] does not limit---

    *   (c) a member who voted for or otherwise authorised the act being removed from office for breach of the individual duties of members or the collective duties of the board; or
    
    *   (d) an application, in accordance with the law, for judicial review; or
    
    *   (e) [section 69][83].
    
    

##### 22 Acts that are not in best interests of statutory entity

        *   (ii) does not have the authority to exercise a power which, given the nature of the statutory entity, a person appointed to that capacity customarily has authority to exercise; or

    *   (b) a document issued on behalf of the entity by a member, office holder, chief executive, employee, or agent of the entity with actual or usual authority to issue the document is not valid or genuine.
    
    (2) However, a statutory entity may assert any of those matters if the person dealing with the statutory entity had, or ought reasonably to have had, knowledge of the matter.
    
    (3) Nothing in this section affects a person's right to apply, in accordance with the law, for judicial review.

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Crown Entities Act 2004\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 February 2013, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][435] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][436] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][437] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][438] and [17E][439] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
