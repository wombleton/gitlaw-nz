    *   (d) other Acts (for example, some provisions of the [State Sector Act 1988][267]) also apply.
    
    (2) This Act applies to a Crown entity, and prevails over the entity's Act, except to the extent that the entity's Act expressly provides otherwise.

##### 14 Functions
    
*   (1) The functions of a statutory entity are---
        
    *   (a) the functions set out in the entity's Act; and
    
    *   (b) if the entity's Act gives the responsible Minister power to add functions, any other functions that the responsible Minister may direct the entity to perform in accordance with that Act and [section 112][147] of this Act; and
    
    *   (c) any functions that are incidental and related to, or consequential on, its functions set out in paragraphs (a) and (b).
    
    (2) In performing its functions, a statutory entity must act consistently with its objectives.

##### 15 Status of statutory entity
    
*   A statutory entity---
        
    *   (a) is a body corporate; and
    
    *   (b) is accordingly a legal entity separate from its members, office holders, employees, and the Crown; and
    
    *   (c) continues in existence until it is dissolved by an Act.
    
    

##### 16 Core things statutory entities can do
    
*   A statutory entity may do anything authorised by this Act or the entity's Act.

##### 17 Other things statutory entities can do
    
*   (1) A statutory entity may do anything that a natural person of full age and capacity may do.
    
    (2) Subsection (1) applies except as provided in this Act or another Act or rule of law.

##### 18 Acts must be for purpose of functions
    
*   A statutory entity may do an act under [section 16][23] or [section 17][24] only for the purpose of performing its functions.

#### Validity of acts

##### 19 Acts in breach of statute are invalid
    
*   (1) An act of a statutory entity is invalid, unless [section 20][28] applies, if it is---
        
    *   (a) an act that is contrary to, or outside the authority of, an Act; or
    
    *   (b) an act that is done otherwise than for the purpose of performing its functions.
    
    (2) Subsection (1) does not limit any discretion of a court to grant relief in respect of a minor or technical breach.

##### 20 Some natural person acts protected
    
*   (1) [Section 19][27], or any rule of law to similar effect, does not prevent a person dealing with a statutory entity from enforcing a transaction that is a natural person act unless the person dealing with the entity had, or ought reasonably to have had, knowledge---
        
    *   (a) of an express restriction in an Act that makes the act contrary to, or outside the authority of, the Act; or
    
    *   (b) that the act is done otherwise than for the purpose of performing the entity's functions.
    
    (2) A person who relies on subsection (1) has the onus of proving that that person did not have, and ought not reasonably to have had, the knowledge referred to in that subsection.
    
    (3) A statutory entity must report, in its annual report, each transaction that the entity has performed in the year to which the report relates that was invalid under [section 19][27] but enforced in reliance on this section.
    
    (4) For the avoidance of doubt, this section does not affect any person's other remedies (for example, remedies in contract) under the general law.

##### 21 Limits on protection of natural person acts
    
*   [Section 20][28] does not limit---
        
    *   (a) [section 60][77] (which provides for injunctions to require or restrain acts); or
    
    *   (b) the board of the statutory entity bringing an action against a member who voted for or otherwise authorised the act for breach of his or her individual duties as a member; or
    
    *   (c) a member who voted for or otherwise authorised the act being removed from office for breach of the individual duties of members or the collective duties of the board; or
    
    *   (d) an application, in accordance with the law, for judicial review; or
    
    *   (e) [section 69][88].
    
    

##### 22 Acts that are not in best interests of statutory entity
    
*   It is irrelevant to the validity of an act that the act is not, or would not be, in the best interests of a statutory entity.
    
    Compare: 1993 No 105 [s 17(3)][289]

##### 23 Dealings between statutory entities and other persons

    *   (a) a person held out by the statutory entity to be a member, office holder, chief executive, employee, or agent of the statutory entity (as the case may be)---
            
        *   (i) has not been duly appointed in that capacity or has ceased to be appointed in that capacity; or
        
        *   (ii) does not have the authority to exercise a power which, given the nature of the statutory entity, a person appointed to that capacity customarily has authority to exercise; or
        
        *   (iii) does not have the authority to exercise a power that the statutory entity holds him or her out as having; or
        
        
    
    *   (b) a document issued on behalf of the entity by a member, office holder, chief executive, employee, or agent of the entity with actual or usual authority to issue the document is not valid or genuine.
    
    (2) However, a statutory entity may assert any of those matters if the person dealing with the statutory entity had, or ought reasonably to have had, knowledge of the matter.
    
    (3) Nothing in this section affects a person's right to apply, in accordance with the law, for judicial review.
    
    Compare: 1993 No 105 [s 18][290]
