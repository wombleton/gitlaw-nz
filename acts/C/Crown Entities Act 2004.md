Preliminary provisions

##### 3 Purpose
    
*   The purpose of this Act is to reform the law relating to Crown entities to provide a consistent framework for the establishment, governance, and operation of Crown entities and to clarify accountability relationships between Crown entities, their board members, their responsible Ministers on behalf of the Crown, and the House of Representatives, and, to that end,---
        
    *   (a) to provide for different categories of Crown entities and for each category to have its own framework for governance (including the degree to which the Crown entity is required to give effect to, or be independent of, government policy):
    
    *   (b) to clarify the powers and duties of board members in respect of the governance and operation of Crown entities, including their duty to ensure the financial responsibility of the Crown entity:
    
    *   (c) to set out reporting and accountability requirements.
    
    

##### 4 Application of Acts to Crown entities
    
*   (1) The rules for the establishment, governance, operation, and accountability of Crown entities are set out in various Acts of Parliament as follows:
        
    *   (a) this Act applies generally to Crown entities:
    
    *   (b) a statutory entity is established by or under the entity's Act, and the entity's Act may supplement, or expressly modify or negate, the provisions of this Act for that entity and its Crown entity subsidiaries:
    
    *   (c) a Crown entity company is incorporated under the [Companies Act 1993][288] and may also have an entity's Act, and the entity's Act (if any) may supplement, or expressly modify or negate, the provisions of this Act for that company and its Crown entity subsidiaries:
    
    *   (d) other Acts (for example, some provisions of the [State Sector Act 1988][289]) also apply.
    
    (2) This Act applies to a Crown entity, and prevails over the entity's Act, except to the extent that the entity's Act expressly provides otherwise.
