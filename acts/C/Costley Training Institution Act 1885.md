*   #### Preamble
    
    WHEREAS Edward Costley, of Auckland, by his last will and testament bequeathed the residue of his real and personal property to his executors named in the said will in trust for certain charities in Auckland as in the said will mentioned, and did empower his said executors to define the persons to whom the moneys or legacies should be paid in trust for the said charities or objects:
    
    And whereas the training school at Kohimarama was one of the charities named in the said will, and was entitled to a proportion of the property bequeathed as aforesaid:
    
    And whereas the executors named in the will, in exercise of their powers thereunder, appointed William Crush Daldy, Shirley Whitfield Hill, and Theodore Minet Haultain, all of Auckland, to be the Trustees (hereinafter referred to as **the Trustees**) or recipients of the money payable to the aforesaid training school at Kohimarama, and have paid to the said Trustees the sum of twenty-four thousand dollars, payable to the said school under the provisions of the said will, and have yet to pay them a further sum of three hundred dollars on the same account:
    
    And whereas doubts have been entertained whether the training school at Kohimarama may be considered the same as the existing school at Kohimarama, which has, together with the school in Howe Street, at Auckland, become incorporated into one school under the same management, and is known as the Auckland Industrial School, and whether the Trustees can apply the aforesaid sum for the school last named:
    
    And whereas the said Trustees are desirous of being authorized to apply the money in their hands to the objects hereinafter named, as being in their opinion the best calculated, under the circumstances, to realize the wishes of the testator:
    
    The words ""twenty-four thousand dollars"" and ""three hundred dollars"" were substituted, as from 10 July 1967, for the words ""twelve thousand pounds"" and ""one hundred and fifty pounds"" pursuant to section [7(1)][16] Decimal Currency Act 1964 (1964 No 27).
