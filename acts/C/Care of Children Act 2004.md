##### 1 Title
    
*   This Act is the Care of Children Act 2004\.

##### 2 Commencement
    
*   This Act comes into force on 1 July 2005\.

## Part 1  
Preliminary provisions

##### 3 Purpose of this Act
    
*   (1) The purpose of this Act is to---
        
    *   (a) promote children's welfare and best interests, and facilitate their development, by helping to ensure that appropriate arrangements are in place for their guardianship and care; and
    
    *   (b) recognise certain rights of children.
    
    (2) To that end, this Act---
        
    *   (a) defines and regulates---
            
        *   (i) parents' duties, powers, rights, and responsibilities as guardians of their children:
        
        *   (ii) parents' powers to appoint guardians:
        
        *   (iii) courts' powers in relation to the guardianship and care of children:
        
        
    
    *   (b) acknowledges the role that other family members may have in the care of children:
    
    *   (c) respects children's views and, in certain cases, recognises their consents (or refusals to consent) to medical procedures:
    
    *   (d) encourages agreed arrangements for, and provides for the resolution of disputes about, the care of children:
    
    *   (e) makes provision for enforcing orders internationally:
    
    *   (f) implements in New Zealand law the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction:
    
    *   (g) reforms and replaces the Guardianship Act 1968 (including the Guardianship Amendment Act 1991).
    
    

##### 4 Child's welfare and best interests to be paramount
    
*   (1) The welfare and best interests of the child must be the first and paramount consideration---
        
    *   (a) in the administration and application of this Act, for example, in proceedings under this Act; and
    
    *   (b) in any other proceedings involving the guardianship of, or the role of providing day-to-day care for, or contact with, a child.
    
    (2) The welfare and best interests of the particular child in his or her particular circumstances must be considered.
    
    (3) A parent's conduct may be considered only to the extent (if any) that it is relevant to the child's welfare and best interests.
    
    (4) For the purposes of this section, and regardless of a child's age, it must not be presumed that placing the child in the day-to-day care of a particular person will, because of that person's sex, best serve the welfare and best interests of the child.
    
    (5) In determining what best serves the child's welfare and best interests, a court or a person must take into account---
        
    *   (a) the principle that decisions affecting the child should be made and implemented within a time frame that is appropriate to the child's sense of time; and
    
    *   (b) any of the principles specified in [section 5][6] that are relevant to the welfare and best interests of the particular child in his or her particular circumstances.
    
    (6) Subsection (5) does not limit [section 6][7] (child's views) or prevent the court or person from taking into account other matters relevant to the child's welfare and best interests.
    
    (7) This section does not limit [section 83][108] or [subpart 4][120] of Part 2\.
    
    Compare: 1968 No 63 s 23(1), (1A), (3); 1989 No 24 [s 6][209]

##### 5 Principles relevant to child's welfare and best interests
    
*   The principles referred to in [section 4(5)(b)][5] are as follows:
        
    *   (a) the child's parents and guardians should have the primary responsibility, and should be encouraged to agree to their own arrangements, for the child's care, development, and upbringing:
    
    *   (b) there should be continuity in arrangements for the child's care, development, and upbringing, and the child's relationships with his or her family, family group, whānau, hapu, or iwi, should be stable and ongoing (in particular, the child should have continuing relationships with both of his or her parents):
    
    *   (c) the child's care, development, and upbringing should be facilitated by ongoing consultation and co-operation among and between the child's parents and guardians and all persons exercising the role of providing day-to-day care for, or entitled to have contact with, the child:
    
    *   (d) relationships between the child and members of his or her family, family group, whānau, hapu, or iwi should be preserved and strengthened, and those members should be encouraged to participate in the child's care, development, and upbringing:
    
    *   (e) the child's safety must be protected and, in particular, he or she must be protected from all forms of violence as defined in [section 3(2) to (5)][210] of the Domestic Violence Act 1995 (whether by members of his or her family, family group, whānau, hapu, or iwi, or by other persons):
    
    *   (f) the child's identity (including, without limitation, his or her culture, language, and religious denomination and practice) should be preserved and strengthened.
    
    Compare: 1989 No 24 [ss 5][211], [13][212], [208][213]; 2003 No 116 [s 12][214]
    
    Section 5(e): amended, on 16 November 2011, by [section 5][215] of the Care of Children Amendment Act 2011 (2011 No 59).

##### 6 Child's views
    
*   (1) This subsection applies to proceedings involving---
        
    *   (a) the guardianship of, or the role of providing day-to-day care for, or contact with, a child; or
    
    *   (b) the administration of property belonging to, or held in trust for, a child; or
    
    *   (c) the application of the income of property of that kind.
    
    (2) In proceedings to which subsection (1) applies,---
        
    *   (a) a child must be given reasonable opportunities to express views on matters affecting the child; and
    
    *   (b) any views the child expresses (either directly or through a representative) must be taken into account.
    
    Compare: 1968 No 63 s 23(1), (2)

##### 7 Lawyer to act for child
    
*   (1) A court may appoint, or direct the Registrar of the court to appoint, a lawyer to act for a child who is the subject of, or who is a party to, proceedings (other than criminal proceedings) under this Act.
    
    (2) However, unless it is satisfied the appointment would serve no useful purpose, the court must make an appointment or a direction under subsection (1) if the proceedings---
        
    *   (a) involve the role of providing day-to-day care for the child, or contact with the child; and
    
    *   (b) appear likely to proceed to a hearing.
    
    (3) To facilitate performance of the lawyer's duties and compliance with [section 6][7] (child's views), the lawyer must, unless he or she considers it inappropriate to do so because of exceptional circumstances, meet with the child.
    
    (4) The lawyer may call any person as a witness in the proceedings, and may cross-examine witnesses called by a party to the proceedings or by the court.
    
    Compare: 1968 No 63 s 30(1)(b), (2), (3)
    
    Section 7(1): amended, on 18 May 2009, by [section 4(1)][216] of the Care of Children Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No 74).

    (4) _Court order_ means a court order made under any enactment; and includes, without limitation, a court order that is made under this Act and embodies some or all of the terms of an agreement to which [section 40(2)][52] or [section 41(2)][53] applies.

#### Making parenting orders work

##### 63 Purpose and overview of sections 64 to 80
    
*   (1) The purpose of [sections 64 to 80][84] is to provide to the court, and to parties to a parenting order, a range of options for making the order work.
    
    (2) To that end, [sections 64 to 80][84]---
        
    *   (a) provide for the parties to request counselling to resolve a dispute over observing and carrying out the order:
    
    *   (b) provide for the court to make orders of various kinds, or to respond in various other ways, if a dispute over contravention of a parenting order is not resolved by the parties themselves:
    
    *   (c) make it an offence for a party to the parenting order to intentionally---
            
        *   (i) contravene the order; or
        
        *   (ii) prevent compliance with the order:
        
        
    
    *   (d) make it an offence to knowingly resist or obstruct the execution of---

    *   (e) make it an offence to knowingly fail or refuse to afford immediate entrance to (all or a part of) any premises to a person executing a warrant of that kind:
    
    *   (f) make it an offence in certain circumstances to take or attempt to take a child out of New Zealand.
    
    

##### 64 Guiding consideration and principles
    
*   (1) In determining whether to make an order or to issue a warrant or to respond in another way under any of [sections 68 to 77][88], the court must (as required by [section 4][5]) consider whether the order or other response would serve the welfare and best interests of the child who is the subject of the parenting order concerned.
    
    (2) The court must, unless the circumstances are exceptional, make orders or issue warrants under any of [sections 70 to 77][90] only as a matter of last resort.
    
    (3) The court may not make orders or issue warrants under any of [sections 72 to 77][92] contrary to the views of a child of or over the age of 16 years, unless the circumstances are exceptional.
    
    Compare: 1968 No 63 s 23(1), (1A)

##### 65 Request for counselling
    
*   (1) A party to a parenting order (or to an agreement of the kind described in [section 40(2)][52]) may ask a Registrar of a Family Court to arrange counselling in respect of a dispute arising from another party to the order (or to the agreement) contravening or appearing to contravene the order (or the agreement).
    
    (2) If 2 or more guardians of a child are unable to agree on a matter concerning the exercise of their guardianship, any of them may ask a Registrar of a Family Court to arrange counselling in respect of their dispute.

##### 66 Procedure for request under section 65(1) or (2)
    
*   The following sections of the [Family Proceedings Act 1980][246] apply, with the following and all other necessary modifications, to a request under [section 65(1) or (2)][85] as if the request were one under [section 9(1)][271] of that Act by a party to a marriage, civil union, or de facto relationship for counselling in respect of the marriage, civil union, or de facto relationship:
        
    *   (a) [section 9(2)][271] (which requires the Registrar to whom the request is made, on the person making the request completing the prescribed form, to arrange for the matter to be referred to a counsellor):
    
    *   (b) [section 11][272] (which relates to the procedure the counsellor must follow on being referred the matter), except that the reference in subsection (2)(a) to whether or not the parties wish to resume or continue the marriage, civil union, or de facto relationship must be read as a reference to whether or not the parties to the parenting order (or the agreement), or the 2 or more guardians, have resolved the dispute:
    
    *   (c) [section 12][273] (which relates to the counsellor's duties in relation to reconciliation or conciliation):
    
    *   (d) [section 12A][269] (which relates to the number of sessions of counselling):
    
    *   (e) [section 12B][270] (which relates to counselling fees and expenses).

##### 67 Registrar may decline requests for counselling and recommend instead applications under section 68
    
*   (1) The Registrar may decline a request under [section 65(1)][85] that relates to a parenting order if he or she considers that arranging for the matter to be referred to a counsellor is unlikely to help the parties to resolve the dispute.
    
    (2) Without limiting the discretion in subsection (1), in exercising that discretion the Registrar must have regard to whether a party to the order has used violence (as defined in [section 3(2)][210] of the Domestic Violence Act 1995) against---
        
    *   (a) another party to the order; or
    
    *   (b) a child in the care of another party to the order; or
    
    *   (c) both.
    
    (3) In declining a request under subsection (1), the Registrar may recommend that any or all of the parties to the order make an application under [section 68][88].
    
    (4) This section overrides [sections 65][85] and [66][86].

##### 68 Court may make certain orders or respond in other ways to contravention of parenting orders
    
*   (1) On an application for the purpose by a party to a parenting order, the court may, if satisfied that another party to the order has contravened the order, do any of the following:
        
    *   (a) admonish the party who has contravened the order:
    
    *   (b) vary or discharge the parenting order under [section 56][73] (for example, by reducing the time during which the child is in the care of, or has contact with, the party who has contravened the order).
    
    (2) The court may (as well as, or instead of, exercising its powers under subsection (1)) consider making an order or issuing a warrant under any of [sections 70 to 77][90] if---
        
    *   (a) the contravention that is the subject of the application under this section is of a serious nature; or
    
    *   (b) the party who has contravened the parenting order has previously contravened that order or another order under this Act.
    
    (3) Nothing in this section limits other powers of the court to deal with a contravention of a parenting order.
    
    (4) On receiving an application under this section, the Registrar---
        
    *   (a) must appoint a date and time for the hearing of the application and, by notice in writing to the parties to the application, inform them of that date and time:
    
    *   (b) may, if the court directs, request them to attend.
    
    

##### 69 Court may require parties to attend for counselling or for hearing of application under section 68
    
*   (1) On an application for the purpose or on its own initiative, the court may issue a summons requiring a person to attend at a time and place to be specified in the summons if the person fails to comply with---
        
    *   (a) a request under [section 11(1)(b)][272] of the Family Proceedings Act 1980 (as modified and applied by [section 66(b)][86] of this Act) that the person attend before a counsellor; or
    
    *   (b) a request under [section 68(4)(b)][88] to attend the hearing of an application under section 68\.
    
    (2) [Section 159][274] of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011 applies to a summons under this section as if it were a witness summons issued under that section.
    
    Compare: 1980 No 94 [s 17][275]
    
    Section 69(2): amended, on 1 July 2013, by [section 413][276] of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011 (2011 No 81).

##### 70 Ordering party to enter into bond
    
*   (1) On an application for the purpose or on its own initiative, the court may order a party who has contravened a parenting order to enter into a bond as an assurance that the party will not contravene the parenting order again.
    
    (2) Before making an order under subsection (1), the court must consider the extent (if any) to which the party has sufficient means to deposit an amount of money in the court.
    
    (3) The bond must specify---
        
    *   (a) the amount of money to be deposited in the court; and
    
    *   (b) the conditions the breach of which may lead to some or all of that money being forfeited to the Crown; and
    
    *   (c) that, if that money is forfeited by a direction under subsection (4), the court may, by an order under [section 71(1)][91] made at the same time as that direction, require costs incurred by another party to the parenting order to be satisfied from that money; and
    
    *   (d) a date after which the bond will no longer be required (if the bond does not cease to be required earlier, because the parenting order ceases to have effect earlier).
    
    (4) If, after entering into the bond, the party contravenes the parenting order again, the court may, at its discretion and on an application for the purpose, direct that some or all of the bond is forfeited to the Crown, but the court must exercise its discretion by taking into account---
        
    *   (a) the reason the bond was imposed; and
    
    *   (b) the extent to which the conditions of the bond have been met or breached; and
    
    *   (c) any explanation given for the breach of the bond conditions; and
    
    *   (d) all other matters the court considers relevant.
    
    (5) Following the earlier of the following dates, the bond is no longer required, and the court must make all reasonable efforts to refund to the party any money not forfeited by a direction of the court under subsection (4):
        
    *   (a) the date on which the parenting order ceases to have effect:
    
    *   (b) the date specified under subsection (3)(d).
    
    (6) Nothing in this section prevents the court, on an application for the purpose or on its own initiative, from revoking the order and directing that any money not forfeited by a direction of the court under subsection (4) be refunded to the party.

##### 71 Costs of contravention
    
*   (1) On an application for the purpose or on its own initiative, the court may order a party to a parenting order (_party B_) to reimburse another party to the order (_party A_), either wholly or in part, for costs party A incurred, if the court is satisfied---
        
    *   (a) that party B contravened the order and had no reasonable excuse for doing so; and
    
    *   (b) that the contravention caused party A to incur the costs; and
    
    *   (c) that the costs party A incurred were reasonable in the circumstances.
    
    (2) An order under subsection (1) (the _costs order_) may require costs (being costs party A incurred and is, under the order, entitled to be reimbursed for by party B) to be satisfied from money---
        
    *   (a) deposited in the court by party B as a bond required by an order under [section 70(1)][90]; and
    
    *   (b) forfeited by a direction under [section 70(4)][90] made at the same time as the costs order is made.
    
    (3) Nothing in this section limits [section 121][152] or [section 142][177].

    (3) An authority may exercise the power conferred by subsection (1) either on or after issuing the warrant, and either on its own initiative or on an application for the purpose made to it by---

    *   (b) a person who is authorised to execute the warrant.
    
    (4) If an authority grants an authorisation under subsection (1) in relation to a warrant, the authority must first write on the front of the warrant, and then sign, a note that states---
        
    *   (a) the fact that a faxed copy of the warrant may be used for the purposes of executing the warrant; and
    
    *   (b) the date and time at which the authorisation expires, which must be the close of the third day after the day on which the authorisation is granted.
    
    (5) A faxed copy of a warrant in respect of which an authorisation granted under this section is in force must, for all purposes, be treated as if it were the warrant, and the provisions of this Act (for example, [sections 75][95] and [79][102]) apply accordingly with all necessary modifications.
    
    (6) Without limiting any other enactment or rule of law, [section 44][278] of the Policing Act 2008 (which relates to protection of Police employees for acts pursuant to process) applies in relation to a faxed copy of a warrant in respect of which an authorisation granted under this section is in force as if that faxed copy were the warrant.
    
    (7) Subsection (6) is for the avoidance of doubt.

*   (1) If an overseas parenting order is registered in New Zealand under [section 81][106] and that order relates to the role of providing day-to-day care for a child, or to having contact with a child, or to both of those matters, no court in New Zealand (other than in proceedings under any of [sections 72 to 76][92]) may, in respect of any matter determined by the overseas parenting order, exercise jurisdiction in relation to the child who is the subject of the order unless---

    *   (a) that the child's welfare and best interests are likely to be adversely affected if the order is not made; or
    
    *   (b) that there has been such a change in the child's circumstances that the order ought to be made.
    
    (3) If a court in New Zealand exercises jurisdiction in proceedings relating to the role of providing day-to-day care for, or relating to having contact with, a child, and does so without notice of the existence of an overseas parenting order relating to that child and that is registered in New Zealand under [section 81][106], any order made by the court on or after the date of the registration of the overseas parenting order and that is in respect of any matter determined by the overseas parenting order is of no effect.

    *   (b) has, since its registration in New Zealand, ceased to be enforceable in the country in which it was made.
    
    (2) The Registrar of a court in which an overseas parenting order is registered must cancel the registration of the order and inform the court in the prescribed overseas country of the cancellation if he or she is satisfied that the order is not enforceable in the prescribed overseas country in which it was made, and is satisfied of those matters by---
        
    *   (a) documentary evidence the Registrar has received; or
    
    *   (b) the refusal of a New Zealand court, on the grounds stated in subsection (1), to enforce the order under [section 72][92] or [section 73][93], or to exercise jurisdiction under [sections 56][73] and [82][107] in respect of the order.

    *   (a) that the application was made more than 1 year after the removal of the child, and the child is now settled in his or her new environment; or

        *   (i) was not actually exercising custody rights in respect of the child at the time of the removal, unless that person establishes to the satisfaction of the court that those custody rights would have been exercised if the child had not been removed; or
        
        *   (ii) consented to, or later acquiesced in, the removal; or
        
        
    
    *   (c) that there is a grave risk that the child's return---
            
        *   (i) would expose the child to physical or psychological harm; or
        
        *   (ii) would otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation; or
        
        
    
    *   (d) that the child objects to being returned and has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate, in addition to taking them into account in accordance with [section 6(2)(b)][7], also to give weight to the child's views; or
    
    *   (e) that the return of the child is not permitted by the fundamental principles of New Zealand law relating to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.
    
    (2) In determining whether subsection (1)(e) applies in respect of an application made under [section 105(1)][134] in respect of a child, the court may consider, among other things,---
        
    *   (a) whether the return of the child would be inconsistent with any rights that the child, or any other person, has under the law of New Zealand relating to refugees or protected persons:
    
    *   (b) whether the return of the child would be likely to result in discrimination against the child or any other person on any of the grounds on which discrimination is not permitted by the United Nations International Covenants on Human Rights.
    
    (3) On hearing an application made under [section 105(1)][134] in respect of a child, a court must not refuse to make an order under section 105(2) in respect of the child just because there is in force or enforceable in New Zealand an order about the role of providing day-to-day care for that child, but the court may have regard to the reasons for the making of that order.

## Schedule 1  
Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction

[s 95][123]

The States signatory to the present Convention,

Firmly convinced that the interests of children are of paramount importance in matters relating to their custody,

Desiring to protect children internationally from the harmful effects of their wrongful removal or retention and to establish procedures to ensure their prompt return to the State of their habitual residence, as well as to secure protection for rights of access,

Have resolved to conclude a Convention to this effect, and have agreed upon the following provisions---

## Chapter I  
Scope of the Convention

### Article 1

The objects of the present Convention are---
    
*   _a_ to secure the prompt return of children, wrongfully removed to or retained in any Contracting State; and

*   _b_ to ensure that rights of custody and of access under the law of one Contracting State are effectively respected in the other Contracting States.

### Article 2

Contracting States shall take all appropriate measures to secure within their territories the implementation of the objects of the Convention. For this purpose they shall use the most expeditious procedures available.

### Article 3

The removal or the retention of a child is to be considered wrongful where---
    
*   it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person, an institution or any other body, either jointly or alone, under the law of the State in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention; and
*   at the time of removal or retention those rights were actually exercised, either jointly or alone, or would have been so exercised but for the removal or retention.

The rights of custody mentioned in sub-paragraph _a_ above, may arise in particular by operation of law or by reason of a judicial or administrative decision, or by reason of an agreement having legal effect under the law of that State.

### Article 4

The Convention shall apply to any child who was habitually resident in a Contracting State immediately before any breach of custody or access rights. The Convention shall cease to apply when the child attains the age of 16 years.

### Article 5

For the purposes of this Convention---
    
*   'rights of custody' shall include rights relating to the care of the person of the child and, in particular, the right to determine the child's place of residence;
*   'rights of access' shall include the right to take a child for a limited period of time to a place other than the child's habitual residence.

## Chapter II  
Central Authorities

### Article 6

A Contracting State shall designate a Central Authority to discharge the duties which are imposed by the Convention upon such authorities.

Federal States, States with more than one system of law or States having autonomous territorial organisations shall be free to appoint more than one Central Authority and to specify the territorial extent of their powers. Where a State has appointed more than one Central Authority, it shall designate the Central Authority to which applications may be addressed for transmission to the appropriate Central Authority within that State.

### Article 7

Central Authorities shall co-operate with each other and promote co-operation amongst the competent authorities in their respective States to secure the prompt return of children and to achieve the other objects of this Convention.

In particular, either directly or through any intermediary, they shall take all appropriate measures---
    
*   to discover the whereabouts of a child who has been wrongfully removed or retained;
*   to prevent further harm to the child or prejudice to interested parties by taking or causing to be taken provisional measures;
*   to secure the voluntary return of the child or to bring about an amicable resolution of the issues;
*   to exchange, where desirable, information relating to the social background of the child;
*   to provide information of a general character as to the law of their State in connection with the application of the Convention;
*   to initiate or facilitate the institution of judicial or administrative proceedings with a view to obtaining the return of the child and, in a proper case, to make arrangements for organising or securing the effective exercise of rights of access;
*   where the circumstances so require, to provide or facilitate the provision of legal aid and advice, including the participation of legal counsel and advisers;
*   to provide such administrative arrangements as may be necessary and appropriate to secure the safe return of the child;
*   to keep each other informed with respect to the operation of this Convention and, as far as possible, to eliminate any obstacles to its application.

## Chapter III  
Return of children

### Article 8

Any person, institution or other body claiming that a child has been removed or retained in breach of custody rights may apply either to the Central Authority of the child's habitual residence or to the Central Authority of any other Contracting State for assistance in securing the return of the child.

The application shall contain---
    
*   information concerning the identity of the applicant, of the child and of the person alleged to have removed or retained the child;
*   where available, the date of birth of the child;
*   the grounds on which the applicant's claim for return of the child is based;
*   all available information relating to the whereabouts of the child and the identity of the person with whom the child is presumed to be.

The application may be accompanied or supplemented by---
    
*   an authenticated copy of any relevant decision or agreement;
*   a certificate or an affidavit emanating from a Central Authority, or other competent authority of the State of the child's habitual residence, or from a qualified person, concerning the relevant law of that State;
*   any other relevant document.

### Article 9

If the Central Authority which receives an application referred to in Article 8 has reason to believe that the child is in another Contracting State, it shall directly and without delay transmit the application to the Central Authority of that Contracting State and inform the requesting Central Authority, or the applicant, as the case may be.

### Article 10

The Central Authority of the State where the child is shall take or cause to be taken appropriate measures in order to obtain the voluntary return of the child.

### Article 11

The judicial or administrative authorities of Contracting States shall act expeditiously in proceedings for the return of children.

If the judicial or administrative authority concerned has not reached a decision within six weeks from the date of commencement of the proceedings, the applicant or the Central Authority of the requested State, on its own initiative or if asked by the Central Authority of the requesting State, shall have the right to request a statement of the reasons for the delay. If a reply is received by the Central Authority of the requested State, that Authority shall transmit the reply to the Central Authority of the requesting State, or to the applicant, as the case may be.

### Article 12

Where a child has been wrongfully removed or retained in terms of Article 3 and, at the date of the commencement of the proceedings before the judicial or administrative authority of the Contracting State where the child is, a period of less than one year has elapsed from the date of the wrongful removal or retention, the authority concerned shall order the return of the child forthwith.

The judicial or administrative authority, even where the proceedings have been commenced after the expiration of the period of one year referred to in the preceding paragraph, shall also order the return of the child, unless it is demonstrated that the child is now settled in its new environment.

Where the judicial or administrative authority in the requested State has reason to believe that the child has been taken to another State, it may stay the proceedings or dismiss the application for the return of the child.

### Article 13

Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding Article, the judicial or administrative authority of the requested State is not bound to order the return of the child if the person, institution or other body which opposes its return establishes that---
    
*   the person, institution or other body having the care of the person of the child was not actually exercising the custody rights at the time of removal or retention, or had consented to or subsequently acquiesced in the removal or retention; or
*   there is a grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation.

The judicial or administrative authority may also refuse to order the return of the child if it finds that the child objects to being returned and has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of its views.

In considering the circumstances referred to in this Article, the judicial and administrative authorities shall take into account the information relating to the social background of the child provided by the Central Authority or other competent authority of the child's habitual residence

### Article 14

In ascertaining whether there has been a wrongful removal or retention within the meaning of Article 3, the judicial or administrative authorities of the requested State may take notice directly of the law of, and of judicial or administrative decisions, formally recognised or not in the State of the habitual residence of the child, without recourse to the specific procedures for the proof of that law or for the recognition of foreign decisions which would otherwise be applicable.

### Article 15

The judicial or administrative authorities of a Contracting State may, prior to the making of an order for the return of the child, request that the applicant obtain from the authorities of the State of the habitual residence of the child a decision or other determination that the removal or retention was wrongful within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention, where such a decision or determination may be obtained in that State. The Central Authorities of the Contracting States shall so far as practicable assist applicants to obtain such a decision or determination.

### Article 16

After receiving notice of a wrongful removal or retention of a child in the sense of Article 3, the judicial or administrative authorities of the Contracting State to which the child has been removed or in which it has been retained shall not decide on the merits of rights of custody until is has been determined that the child is not to be returned under this Convention or unless an application under this Convention is not lodged within a reasonable time following receipt of the notice.

### Article 17

The sole fact that a decision relating to custody has been given in or is entitled to recognition in the requested State shall not be a ground for refusing to return a child under this Convention, but the judicial or administrative authorities of the requested State may take account of the reasons for that decision in applying this Convention.

### Article 18

The provisions of this Chapter do not limit the power of a judicial or administrative authority to order the return of the child at any time.

### Article 19

A decision under this Convention concerning the return of the child shall not be taken to be a determination on the merits of any custody issue.

### Article 20

The return of the child under the provisions of Article 12 may be refused if this would not be permitted by the fundamental principles of the requested State relating to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.

## Chapter IV  
Rights of access

### Article 21

An application to make arrangements for organizing or securing the effective exercise of rights of access may be presented to the Central Authorities of the Contracting States in the same way as an application for the return of a child.

The Central Authorities are bound by the obligations of co-operation which are set forth in Article 7 to promote the peaceful enjoyment of access rights and the fulfilment of any conditions to which the exercise of those rights may be subject. The Central Authorities shall take steps to remove, as far as possible, all obstacles to the exercise of such rights.

The Central Authorities, either directly or through intermediaries, may initiate or assist in the institution of proceedings with a view to organizing or protecting these rights and securing respect for the conditions to which the exercise of these rights may be subject.

## Chapter V

### Article 24

Any application, communication or other document sent to the Central Authority of the requested State shall be in the original language, and shall be accompanied by a translation into the official language or one of the official languages of the requested State or, where that is not feasible, a translation into French or English.

However, a Contracting State may, by making a reservation in accordance with Article 42, object to the use of either French or English, but not both, in any application, communication or other document sent to its Central Authority.

### Article 25

Nationals of the Contracting States and persons who are habitually resident within those States shall be entitled in matters concerned with the application of this Convention to legal aid and advice in any other Contracting State on the same conditions as if they themselves were nationals of and habitually resident in that State.

### Article 26

Each Central Authority shall bear its own costs in applying this Convention.

Central Authorities and other public services of Contracting States shall not impose any charges in relation to applications submitted under this Convention. In particular, they may not require any payment from the applicant towards the costs and expenses of the proceedings or, where applicable, those arising from the participation of legal counsel or advisers. However, they may require the payment of the expenses incurred or to be incurred in implementing the return of the child.

However, a Contracting State may, by making a reservation in accordance with Article 42, declare that it shall not be bound to assume any costs referred to in the preceding paragraph resulting from the participation of legal counsel or advisers or from court proceedings, except insofar as those costs may be covered by its system of legal aid and advice.

Upon ordering the return of a child or issuing an order concerning rights of access under this Convention, the judicial or administrative authorities may, where appropriate, direct the person who removed or retained the child, or who prevented the exercise of rights of access, to pay necessary expenses incurred by or on behalf of the applicant, including travel expenses, any costs incurred or payments made for locating the child, the costs of legal representation of the applicant, and those of returning the child.

### Article 27

When it is manifest that the requirements of this Convention are not fulfilled or that the application is otherwise not well founded, a Central Authority is not bound to accept the application. In that case, the Central Authority shall forthwith inform the applicant or the Central Authority through which the application was submitted, as the case may be, of its reasons.

### Article 28

A Central Authority may require that the application be accompanied by a written authorization empowering it to act on behalf of the applicant, or to designate a representative so to act.

### Article 29

This Convention shall not preclude any person, institution or body who claims that there has been a breach of custody or access rights within the meaning of Article 3 or 21 from applying directly to the judicial or administrative authorities of a Contracting State, whether or not under the provisions of this Convention.

### Article 30

Any application submitted to the Central Authorities or directly to the judicial or administrative authorities of a Contracting State in accordance with the terms of this Convention, together with documents and any other information appended thereto or provided by a Central Authority, shall be admissible in the courts or administrative authorities of the Contracting States.

### Article 31

In relation to a State which in matters of custody of children has two or more systems of law applicable in different territorial units---
    
*   any reference to habitual residence in that State shall be construed as referring to habitual residence in a territorial unit of that State:
*   any reference to the law of the State of habitual residence shall be construed as referring to the law of the territorial unit in that State where the child habitually resides.

### Article 32

In relation to a State which in matters of custody of children has two or more systems of law applicable to different categories of persons, any reference to the law of that State shall be construed as referring to the legal system specified by the law of that State.

A State within which different territorial units have their own rules of law in respect of custody of children shall not be bound to apply this Convention where a State with a unified system of law would not be bound to do so.

### Article 34

This Convention shall take priority in matters within its scope over the _Convention of 5 October 1961 concerning the powers of authorities and the law applicable in respect of the protection of minors_, as between Parties to both Conventions. Otherwise the present Convention shall not restrict the application of an international instrument in force between the State of origin and the State addressed or other law of the State addressed for the purposes of obtaining the return of a child who has been wrongfully removed or retained or of organizing access rights.

### Article 35

This Convention shall apply as between Contracting States only to wrongful removals or retentions occurring after its entry into force in those States.

Where a declaration has been made under Article 39 or 40, the reference in the preceding paragraph to a Contracting State shall be taken to refer to the territorial unit or units in relation to which this Convention applies.

### Article 36

Nothing in this Convention shall prevent two or more Contracting States, in order to limit the restrictions to which the return of the child may be subject, from agreeing among themselves to derogate from any provisions of this Convention which may imply such a restriction.

## Chapter VI

##### Notes

###### 1 General
    
*   This is a reprint of the Care of Children Act 2004\. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the Act as at 1 July 2013, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes.
    
    Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/][331] ![](/images/external_link.gif).

###### 2 Status of reprints
    
*   Under [section 16D][332] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint.
    
    This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained.

###### 3 How reprints are prepared
    
*   A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, _see_ [http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editorial-conventions/][333] ![](/images/external_link.gif) or Part 8 of the _Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force_.

###### 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
    
*   [Section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in [sections 17D][334] and [17E][335] of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
    
    A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000\. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint.
    
    In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of [section 17C][0] of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
        
    *   •omission of unnecessary referential words (such as ""of this section"" and ""of this Act"")
    *   •typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)
    *   •layout of provisions, including:
            
        *   •indentation
        *   •position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)
        
    *   •format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)
    *   •format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as ""the 1st day of January 1999"" is now expressed as ""1 January 1999"")
    *   •position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)
    *   •punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
    *   •Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •case and appearance of letters and words, including:
            
        *   •format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)
        *   •small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters
        
    *   •schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly
    *   •running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)
    *   •format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).
