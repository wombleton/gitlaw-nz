    *   (a) for the purposes of [section 52][66], as if it were a distribution; and
    
    *   (b) for the purposes of subsections (2) and (3) of [section 53][67], as if it were a dividend.
    
    (2) If a company has altered its constitution, or acquired shares, or redeemed shares under [section 69][89], as the case may be, in a manner which cancels or reduces the liability of a shareholder to the company in relation to a share held prior to that alteration, acquisition, or redemption, that cancellation or reduction of liability is to be treated for the purposes of [section 56][70] as a distribution of the amount by which that liability was reduced.
    
    (3) If the liability of a shareholder of an amalgamating company to that company in relation to a share held before the amalgamation is---
        
    *   (a) greater than the liability of that shareholder to the amalgamated company in relation to a share or shares into which that share is converted; or
    
    *   (b) cancelled by the cancellation of that share in the amalgamation,---
    
    the reduction of liability effected by the amalgamation is to be treated for the purposes of [section 56(1) and (5)][70] as a distribution by the amalgamated company to that shareholder, whether or not that shareholder becomes a shareholder of the amalgamated company of the amount by which that liability was reduced.

        *   (i) the matters in subsection (2) were calculated; or
        
        *   (ii) the price was calculated under subsection (3) and why calculating the price using the methodology set out in paragraphs (a) to (c) of subsection (2) would be clearly unfair.
        
        
    
    (2) That price must be a fair and reasonable price (as at the close of business on the day before the date on which the resolution was passed) for the shares held by the shareholder, calculated as follows:
        
    *   (a) first, the fair and reasonable value of the total shares in each class to which the shares belong must be calculated (the _class value_):

    *   (c) thirdly, a portion of each adjusted class value must be allocated to the shareholder in proportion to the number of shares he, she, or it holds in the relevant class.
    
    (3) However, a different methodology from that set out in paragraphs (a) to (c) of subsection (2) may be used to calculate the fair and reasonable price for the shares if using the methodology set out in those paragraphs would be clearly unfair to the shareholder or the company.
    
    (4) The shareholder may object to the price offered by the board for the shares by giving written notice to the company no later than 10 working days after the date on which the board gave written notice to the shareholder under subsection (1).

    *   (a) the date on which the board's offer under subsection (1) is accepted; or
    
    *   (b) if the board has not received an acceptance, the date that is 10 working days after the date on which the board gave written notice to the shareholder under subsection (1).

        *   (i) the fair and reasonable price for the shares, on the basis set out in [section 112(2) and (3)][146]; and
        
        *   (ii) the remedies available to the holder of the shares or the company in respect of any price for the shares that differs from that determined by the board under [section 112][146]; and
        
        
    
    *   (b) the company must, within 5 working days of receiving the objection, pay to the shareholder a provisional price in respect of each share equal to the price offered by the board under [section 112(1)][146].
